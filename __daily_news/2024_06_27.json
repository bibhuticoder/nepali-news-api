After handing over the 32-page report to party president Rabi Lamichhane on Wednesday, Dhakal told the Post: “After the review tour, I have come to the conclusion that if the party continues to run as it does now, it will crash within a short period.”The report Dhakal submitted to Lamichhane, who is the deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs, claims that the popularity of the party which emerged by winning 20 seats in the 2022 election has nosedived. Additionally, the report argues that Lamichhane’s popularity has also dipped. Dhakal demanded that the party should make his report public. But an RSP leader, who is also a federal lawmaker, says as the report deals with the party’s internal matters, it should first have been discussed within the RSP secretariat.“General Secretary Dhakal made a mistake by going to the media before discussing the matter in the party,” the leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Why Dhakal went to the media is a curious matter.”However, Dhakal responded that as the general secretary, he came to the media for the first time since the party’s establishment two years ago. “You should understand why the party is being criticised from various quarters today,” Dhakal told the Post. “The party has faced ruin due to someone’s loose talk. I haven’t done so.”Dhakal’s apparent target was party president Lamichhane, who is often criticised for making unnecessary comments and promises. Although the general secretary has submitted a report based on his observations during the review trip, the implementation of the findings will come only after the party’s secretariat meeting, said Kabindra Burlakoti, the organisational committee head and joint general secretary of the party. “The general secretary personally prepared and submitted the report. No other leaders of the party were involved in its preparation,” Burlakoti told the Post. “The report might not be implemented as it is, and the party’s secretariat might amend it.”Soon after the by-election debacle in April this year, a secretariat meeting of the party on May 3 decided to conduct a cross-country review tour under a Dhakal-led team.The RSP had won one more seat in the House of Representatives from the by-elections held a year ago. But this year, the party’s candidate in Ilam-2 did not win enough votes and even lost the security deposit. RSP candidate Milan Limbu stood fourth when independent candidate Dikendra Singh Limbu won third-highest votes in the constituency.Dhakal commenced the journey on May 19 with the objective of identifying the party’s strengths and weaknesses, in relation to its policies, decisions, and organisational structure. While seeing off Dhakal, Lamichhane expressed his belief that the suggestions and insights gathered during the tour would make the party stronger. The party, which last year secured two out of three by-election seats in Chitwan-2 and Tanahun-1, was optimistic about giving the competitors a tough fight in Ilam-2 in April. While talking to the Post, party leaders engaged in the campaign were then confident of a good performance. On the campaign trail of the 2022 election, RSP leaders, mainly its chair Lamichhane, fiercely criticised leaders of traditional parties and asked voters to remove them from power. However, the RSP leaders then stood accused of working in collusion with the same old parties and their leaders, especially the UML. Additionally, when Lamichhane was linked to various scams, most recently the routing of the cooperative’s money to Gorkha Media Network, the party lost its lustre, leading to its poor performance in Ilam-2. During the election campaign in Ilam-2, Lamichhane was also questioned over a conflict of interest, as his ministry was commanding the police force that was investigating such scams. The RSP joined the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on March 4. RSP President Lamichhane won back the home ministry by driving a hard bargain. Some saw Lamichhane’s insistence on the home ministry as an attempt to try to influence the investigation into the cooperative scam. General Secretary Dhakal claims that the party’s popularity has taken a beating, not only due to the cooperative scam but also because of the party leaders’ unfulfilled promises to voters.Before joining the government on March 4, RSP leaders extensively discussed the ‘Mission 2084’ aimed at making the RSP the largest force in the next general elections. Observers said that the party had joined the government even when it is not in a position to honour its promises to the people.Santosh Pariyar, chief whip of the party in the federal parliament, said he is not fully informed on the report submitted by the party general secretary.“I can’t comment on the report without first going through it,” Pariyar told the Post. “We can say something concrete only after the report is formally presented at the party’s secretariat meeting.”However, party insiders claim that the report criticises the party leadership’s rush for power without much care for the RSP’s original agenda. Another party leader, who also asked not to be named, said the report suggests that the party should have allied with leaders such as Balendra Shah, the mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, rather than joining hands with traditional forces like the UML and the Maoist Centre.Shah is believed to be quietly laying the ground for launching his own political party, cashing in on the public anger against traditional forces.Dhakal also acknowledged that he wants the party to better communicate with Mayor Shah. The RSP should explore the chances of cooperating with him even though the party does not endorse all of his recent activities, Dhakal told the Post.“To start with, the RSP should cooperate with Shah on an agenda like evacuating illegally occupied land in slum areas,” Dhakal said. “By the end of 2083 BS [a year ahead of the 2027 election], the party should also consider allying with Shah.”Despite being in the government, some RSP ministers and party leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction. Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha, addressing a function a few weeks ago, said that time had come to review the party’s participation in the government and its support for the coalition. Shrestha even warned the party leaders to be ready to quit the government. Claiming that they carry resignation letters all the time, Shrestha said, “As soon as we start feeling frustrated, we will put in our papers.” ","summary":"Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) General Secretary Mukul Dhakal, in his political document prepared after a review tour of 32 districts, has claimed that the party is headed for an accident.In his political report, Dhakal has pointed out things the two-year old party needs to rectify in order to avert such an accident.

As soon as the borders—land and air—opened, and the China-funded international airport in Pokhara was inaugurated, optimism was high. Before the pandemic, market insiders predicted a dramatic surge in Chinese tourists, who were Nepal’s second-largest source market after India before the Covid-19 pandemic. It didn’t happen. Nepal received 60,878 Chinese tourists in 2023, a recovery by a third from the pre-pandemic level when Chinese tourists boomed in Nepal.In the first five months (January–May) of this year, Nepal received 46,671 Chinese, with the highest arrival of 12,093 recorded in March. While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise. Before Monday’s meeting, during the third Nepal Investment Summit held in Kathmandu on April 28, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, announced the waiver of visa fees for Nepalis.It was implemented on May 1. There was another announcement, too.“The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini,” Luo said while addressing the summit.Nepal’s $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country’s tourism capital, opened in January last year. Beijing financed it.Similarly, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started operating in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objectives of both projects are to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, attract more tourists, and prevent Nepalis from going abroad.But only some international flights are operating in the two new shiny airports.“Under Beijing's renewed diplomacy, there is a possibility of the operation of these two new international airports,” said Basant Raj Mishra, a senior tourism entrepreneur. “Once flights from China come, it will create competition.”He said Beijing’s announcement represents a great opportunity for Nepal. “We should be prepared for joint marketing and promotional activities. With a proper policy, we can attract 1 million tourists from China alone in 2025. And for this, we need enhanced flight connectivity.”China is facing many economic obstacles, but Beijing remains optimistic about growth.Reports show that Chinese tourists hit the road in significant numbers during the recent five-day Labor holidays in May but kept a tight grip on their wallets, reflecting still-weak sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy.According to a statement from China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, travellers made 28.2 percent more trips, but spending only rose 13.5 percent from the 2019 break. “Of all the countries, China has the largest number of airlines connecting Nepal but brings the lowest number of tourists,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president (Administration) at Himalaya Airlines, the Nepal-Tibet joint venture. There are five airlines currently connecting China. “The traffic is low,” said Shrestha. “It may be due to low consumer confidence.”Himalaya Airlines has suspended Kathmandu-Beijing flights, and Kathmandu-Shanghai flights are also irregular due to low passenger traffic. Besides, in the other three sectors, the average occupancy is 40 percent,” said Shrestha. “The announcement from Beijing to promote Nepal in China could change that.”Nepal and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1955, and Nepal-Tibet trade goes a long way back. In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied. ","summary":"On March 15 last year, China reopened its borders for travel, ending a three-year closure during the Covid pandemic. As soon as the borders—land and air—opened, and the China-funded international airport in Pokhara was inaugurated, optimism was high. Before the pandemic, market insiders predicted a dramatic surge in Chinese tourists, who were Nepal’s second-largest source market after India before the Covid-19 pandemic. It didn’t happen. Nepal received 60,878 Chinese tourists in 2023, a recovery by a third from the pre-pandemic level when Chinese tourists boomed in Nepal.In the first five months (January–May) of this year, Nepal received 46,671 Chinese, with the highest arrival of 12,093 recorded in March. While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise.

Assange, now 51, stepped into freedom outside of an American court in the US Pacific island territory of Saipan on Wednesday after pleading guilty to a criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified defence documents. As he was sentenced to time he had already served in prison, he was allowed to head home to Australia.Assange’s freedom has come as a relief to his supporters across the globe, especially so for those who value the disclosures made by the company he founded, WikiLeaks. In November 2010, WikiLeaks had released over 250,000 US diplomatic cables with the help of Chelsea Manning, a former US army soldier who was convicted under the US Espionage Act and had her sentence commuted by President Barack Obama. The WikiLeaks exposed, among other things, the fact that the US forces in Baghdad had killed 11 people in a 2007 helicopter attack; criticism of the UK’s military operation in Afghanistan by US commanders and the Afghan president; and thousands of US diplomatic cables that revealed how the US used its embassies for espionage. In 2016, WikiLeaks again came to prominence after exposing thousands of hacked emails of the Democratic National Committee, causing a possible setback for the US Democratic Party presidential candidate Hilary Clinton. WikiLeaks was then accused of collaborating with the Russian government to influence the US presidential elections, which Donald Trump, Clinton’s opponent, won.Shaken by the incriminating revelations on their modus operandi, Western nations, led by the US, launched an all-out war against Assange and WikiLeaks. Assange’s global legitimacy took a hit after Sweden’s abortive attempt to prosecute him for sexual allegations and the Ecuadorian Embassy’s allegation of rude behaviour while staying with them as a refugee-guest. Beyond the questions of his personal conduct, though, Assange continued to be considered a victim of the Western world’s crusade against the free press. Assange found his champions, among other global intellectuals, in Noam Chomsky and Arundhati Roy, both of whom condemned the US government’s anti-democratic attempts at silencing a journalist-crusader. In a strange turn of events, Roy, Indian writer known for speaking on behalf of the freedom of the country’s impoverished Adivasis and Dalits, now faces sedition charges in her home country for a speech she made in 2010. The hounding of Roy is a clear case of the Indian government, led by the right-wing strongman Narendra Modi, silencing dissenting voices. In Nepal, Kailash Sirohiya, the publisher of The Kathmandu Post, spent nine days in jail last month and continues to face prosecution for an alleged forgery of citizenship certificates while in reality, he is being hounded for his publication’s consistent coverage of the corruption allegations against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The abuse of authority to silence journalists, intellectuals and dissenters is a global phenomenon today. Julian Assange’s ordeal is a reality check of the price one must pay for speaking truth to power.  "},{"hash":"aa1a2ac88acb144336ae5c439df6e1b111176ee8ee489aeb1cadd983b2feba88","title":"the-question-of-judicial-reforms","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/26/the-question-of-judicial-reforms","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/sambaidhanikbato0472021052737-1719410999.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719360000000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"**Nepali Sports and Judicial Reforms**\n\n**Cricket World Cup:**\nNepal's cricket team performed well but faced setbacks due to US visa issues for star player Sandeep Lamichhane.\n\n**Judicial Reforms:**\n- Former Supreme Court Bar Association president, Purna Man Shakya, proposed reforms to improve the judiciary.\n- Key recommendations include:\n    - Removing parliamentary hearings for Supreme Court nominees to ensure independence.\n    - Increasing the retirement age of judges by two years.\n    - Raising the minimum age for Supreme Court justices to 55.\n\n**Constitutional Court:**\n- The NBA recommended establishing a constitutional court or a permanent constitutional bench to settle disputes regarding the constitution.\n\n**Local Courts:**\n- The establishment of local courts is suggested to improve access to justice and reduce the reliance on politically influenced judicial committees.\n\n**Overall Impact:**\nThese reforms aim to enhance the independence, efficiency, and accessibility of the judicial system in Nepal.","summary":"An exciting couple of weeks in Nepali sports came to an end with the creditable exit of the national team from the ongoing cricket T20 World Cup being held on the other side of the globe. In the run-up to the tourney, though, there was some drama on the sidelines, having to do with the United States refusing to issue a visa to Nepal’s star cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane, twice, seemingly for his status as a rape accused (albeit cleared by Nepali courts).Using the (perhaps-imperfect) metric of the number of Facebook ‘shares’ of the two stories as they appeared on the news portal, Onlinekhabar, Lamichhane’s consecutive US visa refusals were widely followed by Nepalis. The first, from May 22, was shared more than 11,000 times, while the second, from May 30, exceeded 15,000. The latter also had dozens of comments lambasting the US embassy but many also strongly supporting its decision to bar Lamichhane.What struck me was how little interest was generated by another Onlinekhabar piece that appeared on May 22 itself. This was an interview with Purna Man Shakya, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association and convenor of the committee set up by the Nepal Bar Association (NBA) to suggest reforms in Nepal’s judicial sector. Even though we can easily debate till we are blue in the face about what ails our nation, the conversation with Shakya, which dealt with current issues but also with potentially profound implications for Nepal, had received a measly 275 shares at the time of writing—one month later. So much for our priorities.Old and olderSince the NBA document is not publicly available, we must rely on Shakya’s recounting of its content and the recommendations made. Most significantly, it appears that if the lawmakers were to seriously consider the NBA’s suggestions, it would require an amendment to the constitution, a move that the politicians have shied away from since the 2016 amendment, mainly to assuage India (as well as the agitating Madhes-based parties), and the 2020 amendment incorporating Nepal’s new map in the constitution, in a direct attempt to needle India. The rest of this article deals with aspects of what Shakya said, which includes some of his rather frank and alarming assessments of how the judiciary has been functioning.One of the NBA’s recommendations is for the constitutional provision of parliamentary hearings for nominees to the Supreme Court be done away with. Asked to elaborate, Shakya starts off by pointing out that not a single person has been rejected by the parliamentary hearing committee till date. Instead, he says, the situation as it pertains now requires presumptive justices to go around kowtowing to political party bosses before the parliamentary hearings. Such trends compromise the independence of the judiciary, he says, since party leaders are likely to enter a quid pro quo arrangement in return for the nominee’s endorsement.“What we witnessed in past parliamentary hearings is that justices are asked different questions to discourage them and then without any [credible] reason, they are approved by issuing a party whip,” says Shakya. “The constitution did not expect this kind of hearing. If there are provisions in the constitution that cannot reform the judiciary, it is better to remove them altogether.”Another recommendation is on the tenure of justices. The committee has recommended raising the retirement age of all judges by two years. Hence, district and high court justices would retire at 65 and Supreme Court justices at 67. This, Shakya argues, is to reflect the growing longevity of Nepalis in general. When the current age limits were introduced, the average life expectancy of Nepalis was 54; it is now 71. Raising the age of retirement will allow the country to benefit from their “knowledge, experience and expertise”.At the same time, though, the committee has also recommended that the minimum age for entry as Supreme Court justices be increased to 55. Says Shakya: “There is no need for anyone below 55 to be in a hurry to become a Supreme Court justice. If those with established competence, expertise and ability are inducted into the Supreme Court at 55, they will still have 12 years to prove themselves…The experience in the past has been that instead of mature and able judges with long experience, those who would not be able to withstand [political] pressure began to be appointed. The tradition has been for appointing people amenable to the parties in line to become the chief justice.”Not that these are fact unknown to the public, but coming publicly from someone of Shakya’s stature makes his claims even more explosive. On the now-established convention of choosing the Supreme Court chief justice by seniority, he says that the NBA pushed for such an arrangement since otherwise those in the Constitutional Council would pick and choose the one they could easily manipulate, resulting in justices currying favour with party leaders. He even accuses members of the Constitutional Council, presumably, past and present, of never having allowed their choice to be guided by the imperative of improving the judicial sector.Constitutional contentionsReaders may recall that during the discussion on the 2015 constitution, there was talk of setting up a constitutional court, following the precedent of scores of countries to settle issues pertaining mainly to the interpretation of the constitution. Following strong pushback from the judiciary, the framers of our constitution instead opted for a constitutional bench within the Supreme Court under the leadership of the chief justice. After much lobbying, the five-member constitutional bench was finally formed in 2021, consisting of the chief justice and the four senior-most of the Supreme Court justices, but has been pretty dysfunctional since.The NBA committee’s recommendations also dwelt on this unfortunate situation, particularly when the federalism exercise has thrown up numerous disputes over questions of jurisdiction. Shakya says we are likely headed in the direction of a constitutional court even though there is no consensus on the matter in the NBA and current opinion appears to be veering towards a permanent constitutional bench. Providing the rationale for such a suggestion, Shakya says that the constitutional bench does not meet regularly. “The constitution has to be interpreted. The constitutional bench has to give time for that. Judges have to be engaged in deep study.”One far-reaching recommendation affecting the general population is on the establishment of courts at the local level as envisaged by the constitution. Currently, judicial committees headed by deputy heads in municipalities and rural municipalities have been empowered to rule on many civil cases even though they are meant to seek resolution of conflicts through reconciliation only. Shakya says that the judicial committees are headed by politicians, and as such, their decisions can always be questioned. Hence, the need for local courts.Overall, these changes are likely to improve the judiciary’s efficiency—should lawmakers have any appetite for them, that is. Of course, the proof is always in the pudding for we may have the best laws, but it is the manner in which they are interpreted and implemented that will matter the most.

The reliance on the US dollar for international trade and reserves no longer exists. For trade and reserves, governments worldwide use a variety of currencies such as the euro, yuan and bitcoin. This impending trend seriously threatens Western countries’ economic leverage and financial stability, particularly the US. Consequently, we should expect a paradigm shift in the global balance of power, drastically reducing Western influence over global financial systems while assisting the Asian economic boom.According to World Dominion University, de-dollarisation can substantially impact a country's currency rate. When one reduces its dollar holdings and diversifies into other currencies, the demand for the US dollar falls, resulting in a depreciation against other currencies. This devaluation may increase exports by making domestically produced goods and services more competitive in international markets. Furthermore, de-dollarisation can reduce the risk of dollar-denominated debt, providing better control over debt management and possibly reducing borrowing costs. Triggers for de-dollarisation The triggering factors for de-dollarisation are different but massively interrelated to each other in the current upheaval. Above all, the long-term suicidal decisions of the US government to sanction countries like Iran, Russia and Venezuela have forced these nations to seek alternatives to the dollar. In addition, currency wars, where countries compete to devalue their currencies to increase exports, have made many nations wary of dollar dependence. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) actively promote trade in their currencies, significantly reducing reliance on the dollar. At the same time, persistent US trade deficits have another blow to the dollar’s long-term stability. The rise of BRICS nations into the alternative of G7 countries is another strategic reason for the dollar's decline. These countries desire to transition away from a US-dominated global financial system by trading in their currencies, pushing them towards economic emancipation. This bloc has already taken the first step toward adopting a new currency to some extent. The beginning of the dollar collapse can be traced back to 2014 when the US placed economic sanctions on Russia and prohibited dollar commerce internationally. This is the point at which many countries having issues with the US consider alternatives to the dollar. Numerous countries have negotiated bilateral agreements during the past decade to avoid the Russian experience, resulting in a 20 percent decline in the dollar’s value in global trade. According to the IMF, the dollar's proportion of the central bank's foreign exchange reserves dropped to 59 percent in 2022 from about 70 percent in 1999.Geopolitical shiftsThe definition of de-dollarisation and BRICS illustrates the narrow idea of de-dollarisation, which extends beyond the BRICS and has far-reaching implications for the global economic system. The growing use of bilateral currencies in international trade and finance demonstrates the government's strong desire to preserve its financial interests, strengthen monetary sovereignty and reduce exposure to external shocks. The global south has won some ground in replacing currency exchange techniques. However, the balance of power in the international financial system will alter substantially, affecting investment flows, exchange rates and global economic stability. Historically, trading currencies have played an important role in shaping the global economic environment and geopolitical dynamics. Because of its extensive colonial territory, the Spanish real has served as a medium of exchange for international trade since the 16th century. The Dutch guilder first appeared in the 17th century. The British pound was a dominant currency during the 18th and early 19th centuries because of the British Empire. The US dollar rose to prominence during World Wars I and II when other emperors were absent from politics and the economic sphere. Due to the country's economic and financial prowess, the US dollar has emerged as the principal trading currency in the 21st century. However, the ascent of the European euro to some extent and the extensive entry of the Chinese yuan into the global market have posed a severe challenge to the US dollar.According to the last 500 years of political and economic evidence, there has been a repeated pattern in currency substitution, with each empire holding its currency for approximately 100 years through international trade. We are beginning another upheaval that will reshape the economic powerhouse. The new aspect of this transformation will be the resurrection of Asian economic history after 500 years. China is extending its vast use of the yuan and establishing an alternative financial system by strategically collaborating with other SCO and BRICS members. These countries collaborate in the de-dollarisation or unification of the global south, particularly Asia, Africa and Latin America, to protect the countries against Western financial instability or build a defense mechanism against the weaponisation of the dollar-based financial system. Technological advancementsRapid technical advancements, particularly in blockchain and digital currencies, have created simple and novel means to achieve the de-dollarisation agenda. It will provide many methods outside the traditional financial system while being neutral and efficient. Furthermore, it creates an entirely non-dollar-based infrastructure, institutions and market mechanisms without intervention from the conventional financial system.In this environment, decentralising cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will appeal to world countries looking for various asset-reservation solutions. According to a Harvard University study, countries with a moderate risk of sanctions have opted to launch gold and Bitcoin allocations by their central banks. Countries such as Bhutan and El Salvador have begun to include Bitcoin in their reserves.Cryptocurrencies allow decentralisation and borderless transactions, calling existing banking systems into question and lowering huge transition costs in cross-border trade. In this case, Russia and China have been examining the potential of creating digital currencies to replace the US dollar-dominated financial system. It is true that technical innovation has accelerated the process of de-dollarisation and has become an essential tool for diversifying currency reserves.In this global overhaul of de-dollarisation, countries like Nepal would largely benefit as our economy will be less reliant on the US dollar for international commerce and financial activities. This transition will lower our exposure to dollar-related swings and lead to more stable economic conditions. Since Nepal has the lion's share of commerce with neighbouring nations such as China and India, employing local currencies might reduce transition costs and foster strong regional economic links. Furthermore, diversifying in foreign reserves like the rupee and yuan could stabilise Nepal financially. ","summary":"Recently, de-dollarisation has been making headlines worldwide.

Be it the Chure region, Kaligandaki River, or any other hill or river, such activities have robbed these ecologically sensitive places of their natural beauty and richness. This in turn poses a significant threat to wildlife, environment and humans, and the severity of the risks escalates during the monsoon due to frequent floods and landslides. Yet the Nepali state appears largely unbothered. A recent Post report about the illegal extraction at the Kalakhola area in Baglung Municipality-13, which has put an under-construction “industrial village” and settlements in the area at heightened risk of erosion, captures the disasters such activities can invite. Thanks to haphazard extraction, the Kaligandaki River has reportedly altered its course, increasing the risk of flooding in nearby settlements and affecting the area set aside for industries. This, however, isn’t an isolated case. Every year, hundreds of people lose their lives due to landslides brought about by the construction of feeder roads connected to national highways. Roads constructed just above people’s roofs have also taken a toll on lives and property. Of course, it is illegal to bulldoze riverbeds and build shoddy roads. In 2020, the Supreme Court banned extraction activities to protect the Kaligandaki and the settlements near the river. Similarly, the Public Road Act (1974), Section 19 prohibits building an access road joined to the public road without permission from the department of roads. Local and provincial governments are mainly responsible for constructing auxiliary roads, while local governments are tasked with monitoring and regulating extraction activities. But the political support for the illegal extractors, locals’ necessity for road connectivity, and, most importantly, the fact that many local level representatives are contractors have made it difficult to stop these illegal activities at the local level. In many cases, local representatives flout the laws and use their excavators to build connecting roads. As a part of the asare vikas, they spend the bulk of the budget only at the end of the fiscal year. Roads, as a result, are built without proper study, environmental impact and need assessment. Federal apathy has further emboldened the illegal extractors and unscrupulous constructors. We should be mindful of what negligence and encroachments can do to our natural resources. On the one hand, the government advocates for environmental protection but on the other, it continues to blatantly overlook the issue. This is perhaps because the extraction of riverbed materials has become a lucrative business. For example, as the country is self-sufficient in cement production, with the capacity to produce 17 million tonnes, the authorities perhaps don’t want to lose that point of pride. But people’s health and wellbeing should always come first. The pursuit of development and profits should, as such, not overshadow environmental concerns. Now that the monsoon is upon us, many places will see illegal road construction and riverbed extraction. In order to forestall more damage to life and property, the first order of business must be to identify areas where unsustainable extraction has taken place as well as the roads that need immediate repair. Contractors and licensed miners should be mandated to follow the environmental impact guidelines, and if they fail, their licences should be revoked. If the government can hold them to account and implement stringent policies, precious lives and natural resources can be saved. Only by being proactive and factoring in long-term sustainability can we save our environment and protect our wellbeing as well as of the generations to come.  ","summary":"Haphazard road construction in hills and illegal riverbed extraction down in the plains have become all too common in Nepal.

All teams finished on four points, but Romania pushed the Belgians into second on goals scored. Slovakia finished above Ukraine on goal difference to advance as one of the four best third-place finishers.With all four sides locked on points as the final games began there was no margin for error, while a win would see any team through, and both sides went hunting for goals from the kick-off.The best early chance fell to Romelu Lukaku, who was played in by a trademark defence-splitting pass from Kevin De Bruyne in the seventh minute, but as so often in this tournament, the burly striker fluffed his finish and the danger was easily averted, setting the tone for Belgium’s evening.Stringing five across the back, defending was the focus for Ukraine and they did so all over the pitch, pressing hard and tackling aggressively, but not recklessly, as they sought to contain the Belgians.They had chances of their own too, and Roman Yaremchuk will regret not being more selfish when he was played in and, rather than shooting, opted to square to Artem Dovbyk, but his pass was too hard and flew harmlessly across the goal.By halftime all four teams in the group had still only gained a point, with the Romanians and Slovakians adding a goal each in a 1-1 draw in Frankfurt, and eventually Ukraine had to release the handbrake to go for victory.A triple substitution by Serhiy Rebrov in the 70th minute didn’t quite have the desired effect however, and substitute Yannick Carrasco almost scored for Belgium with a stinging shot that was parried away by Anatoliy Trubin.Ruslan Malinovskyi almost netted with a low corner whipped in at the near post but Koen Casteels was alive to the danger, and Taras Stepanenko headed over from the resulting corner as the Ukrainians increased the pressure.Belgium could have snatched a late winner but Bakayoko curled his shot past the far post, and Georgiy Sudakov wasted a glorious stoppage-time chance for Ukraine after a storming attack through the middle, but he fired his shot straight at Casteels.The referee’s whistle went, yet Belgian joy was short-lived as boos and whistles rained down from the stands after another unimpressive display, although they will at least have a chance to redeem themselves while Ukraine head home.

Since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is the authorised body to collect the complaints, advocates for the victims doubt the legitimacy of the applications solicited by the local governments. “What will be the legality of the applications? Will they be recognised by the TRC? As far as I know, the TRC will not accept them,” said Devi Khadka, coordinator of the National Association of Conflict Rape Victims, a network of CRSV victims.The government issued a circular to the local governments to collect the applications with the primary objective of providing relief and compensation to the insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual assault. The state continues to neglect such victims. Neither have they been recognised by the state nor have they received any relief from the government. As many as 63,718 complaints have been registered with the TRC. However, only 314, less than half a percent of the total, are related to rape and sexual violence. Very few victims lodged complaints as they were not convinced that their records would be kept confidential, according to Khadka. “We are not convinced that the local governments can maintain confidentiality. Unlike other victims, they cannot come out on the open because of the social stigma associated,” she said. “Most victims of rape and sexual violence haven’t revealed their ordeals even to their husbands and close family members. Doing so means breaking their families.”If Khadka’s claim is anything to go by, seven insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual violence from a local unit in the Sudurpaschim Province are in trouble as it could not keep their secrets. The representatives at the local level, however, say they are working to support the victims as per the federal government’s circular. “Some 35 victims have applied at our municipality. We are serious about maintaining their confidentiality,” Tilakram Lamsal, mayor at Thakurbaba Municipality in Bardiya, told the Post. He, however, said he was unaware whether the TRC or the federal government will recognise the applications they have collected.Officials at the home ministry also say they are not sure about the legality of the complaints. Radha Kumari Shrestha, an officer with the Peace Promotion Department at the Ministry of Home Affairs, said they got the circular to register the victims for their documentation and to provide relief and reparations. “I am not sure whether the TRC will own up the applications,” she told the Post, adding that respective local governments are responsible for maintaining confidentiality.Through the national budget the federal government has announced plans to create a peace fund of Rs1 billion to provide compensation and financial support to conflict victims. Similarly, different local governments also have allocated budgets to support conflict victims including the CRSV. After months-long discussions, cross-party lawmakers have agreed to allow three months for the registration of the complaints by the victims who missed out on doing so in the past. The victims say the government and parties should prioritise endorsing the amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, which will formally open the doors for the TRC to receive the complaints.Laxmi Pokharel, a human rights lawyer with the International Court of Jurists, said the idea of allowing the local governments to keep records of victims is not wrong. However, there are no proper mechanisms at the local units to safely keep the records of the victims of rape and sexual violence. “There is no uniformity among the local governments in providing relief. While some are working actively, several others are doing nothing. This is leading to disparity,” she told the Post. “The federal government should formulate a uniform policy in providing relief, one that will be applicable across the country.”Currently, the Khadka-led organisation has been continuously working to screen the physical and mental health of CRSV victims. A recent medical test conducted among 38 rape victims from the Maoist insurgency showed 11 of them had cancer. Similarly, an additional eight need immediate surgery to remove their uterus. “Further tests are being conducted to ascertain the stage of their cancer. This is very serious,” said Khadka. In the medical tests conducted in December last year, an overwhelming 70 percent of the 127 victims had one or more reproductive health-related complications. The health condition of five of them was bad enough to need regular tests and treatment.  ","summary":"The advocates for justice for victims of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) have objected to the decision by local governments to start registration of such victims, questioning its legality and assurance of confidentiality.Following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, a number of local governments have started collecting applications from the victims of conflict-related sexual violence.The applications have been called from women and girls who faced sexual violence at the hands of state security forces and then Maoist rebels, but whose cases are missing from the state’s records of victims.

That is why, despite a long apprenticeship in bilateral relations, I consider myself a novice on the subject. Sometimes, our limited knowledge creates misunderstanding and distrust even if the relationship remains intact. For the past 60 years or so, some people have tried to define the Nepal-India relationship in their own emotional ways but have failed to make any dent without India’s wish. Their concern is understandable when seen from the perspective of broad principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence, forgetting that inter-state relations are guided more by pragmatism than principles. For any country, national interest is supreme while conducting foreign policies. Most politicians and intellectuals driven by emotions forget that the conditions surrounding them are more deterministic than their feelings. Here comes the question of geo-politics, geo-economics and geo-strategic contexts.The Nepal-India relationship since the Treaty of Sugauli continues to define both limitations of powers and the relationship pattern. Even if some minor adjustments or changes occur, the substance and nature of bilateral relations remain the same. For some Nepalis, symbols matter more than substance, which is vital for conducting bilateral ties. Even then, both countries do not deviate from the main course of the unchanged relationship. India, too, has not departed from conventional policy by trying to operate within the same parameters as the old rulers. Even if the situation and context changed, the basics of the relationship remain the same.India does not like to disturb the structure of the relationship, relating it to its larger national security issue. It seems that even in the future, apart from some minor adjustments, it is unlikely to be drastically altered. Indians think opening the 1950 Treaty is like opening the “pandora’s box” and, hence, needs to be cautiously handled. Without being on the firm ground of reality, Nepalis will experience more woes. Knowing the implications and given the limited strategic autonomy, King Mahendra, apparently a die-hard nationalist, also didn’t raise the issue of the 1950 treaty. Still, policy measures adopted by the royal government and India have led to the erosion of some treaty provisions. Coming close on the heels of the continuity of the relationship, the former foreign secretary and Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shyam Saran, said at a talk programme recently, “There will be more continuity than departure in India’s foreign policy in coming days–in rhetoric and style”. Then what alternative approach can Nepal take? I think focusing on the country’s development, projection of good governance and image by showing the ability to prosper and make people confident should be the strategy. If all-round development takes place by raising people's life standards, national confidence and maturity would grow, eventually leading to better cooperation with the immediate neighbours. The status of a nation is not raised by too much politicisation of relationships, as we have been witnessing for over six decades. Nor is foreign policy conducted through an emotional approach alone. Some developmental activities and formal and informal channels used by both sides to sort out immediate problems arising from time to time can measure how the two countries have stabilised bilateral relations and cooperative endeavours since the 1950s. Regime changes have not at all affected the continuity of the developmental process. Today, the development pace is faster than before. The political environment, irrespective of governments, is favourable, as parties and leaders seem to have understood the significance of development despite their subjective views on various issues. Now, Nepal and India have reached an understanding of purchasing 10000 megawatts of electricity by India and facilitating Nepal’s use of the Indian corridor for power sale to Bangladesh. Since Nepal and India are two separate nations politically and historically, civilisational commonalities do not always work when the question of nation-state arises. Therefore, it is natural that some divergent approaches to events and developments are noticed not to the extent of damaging the structure and dynamics of bilateral relationships. Some issues are perceived differently by the elites of the two countries. For example, some patches of the border often trigger controversy. The two governments have claimed that 97 percent of the border problem will be solved if both sides officially agree. But Nepal is not prepared to agree unless other disputed territories such as Sushta, Kalapanri-Lipulekh and Limpiadhura are settled. Sushta’s problem could have been settled long ago as it is not serious from an Indian security point of view. The Kalapani issue is complex because India considers it settled, but it contrasts with Nepal’s claim that goes far beyond the existing border. Since the newly adopted map called chuche naksa (pointed map) that shows the border up to Limpiadhura has already been passed by the Nepali Parliament by a two-thirds majority after reaching some sort of national consensus, it has become more complex. India reacted to Nepal’s action as a unilateral “cartographic assertion”, adding that the lands claimed by Nepal belong to India. The issue has become more complicated because of the long Indian rule (bhogchalan) and Nepal’s new claim as its territory. In addition to such complex issues, minor problems such as waterlogging in some parts of the Tarai, inundation, floods and trade deficit reduction are nagging. However, the issue of balance of trade entirely lies with Nepal’s capacity to enhance production and make Nepali products market-worthy in India and elsewhere. Only then can Nepal expect India’s cooperation to facilitate Nepali products to enter the Indian market. Mutual trust and confidence on both sides are essential to resolve ensuing differences, big or small. Moreover, perception, rather than reality, gives grounds for distrust. India should not be too suspicious of Nepal’s relations with China and other Western powers, especially the US, as it is armed with leverage over Nepal because, even if it wishes, the latter cannot cross the Rubicon due to various compulsions.   ","summary":"The Nepal-India relationship is complex, wide-ranging and deep, making it difficult to fathom. That is why, despite a long apprenticeship in bilateral relations, I consider myself a novice on the subject. Sometimes, our limited knowledge creates misunderstanding and distrust even if the relationship remains intact. For the past 60 years or so, some people have tried to define the Nepal-India relationship in their own emotional ways but have failed to make any dent without India’s wish. Their concern is understandable when seen from the perspective of broad principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence, forgetting that inter-state relations are guided more by pragmatism than principles. For any country, national interest is supreme while conducting foreign policies. Most politicians and intellectuals driven by emotions forget that the conditions surrounding them are more deterministic than their feelings. Here comes the question of geo-politics, geo-economics and geo-strategic contexts.The Nepal-India relationship since the Treaty of Sugauli continues to define both limitations of powers and the relationship pattern. Even if some minor adjustments or changes occur, the substance and nature of bilateral relations remain the same. For some Nepalis, symbols matter more than substance, which is vital for conducting bilateral ties. Even then, both countries do not deviate from the main course of the unchanged relationship. India, too, has not departed from conventional policy by trying to operate within the same parameters as the old rulers. Even if the situation and context changed, the basics of the relationship remain the same.India does not like to disturb the structure of the relationship, relating it to its larger national security issue. It seems that even in the future, apart from some minor adjustments, it is unlikely to be drastically altered. Indians think opening the 1950 Treaty is like opening the “pandora’s box” and, hence, needs to be cautiously handled. Without being on the firm ground of reality, Nepalis will experience more woes. Knowing the implications and given the limited strategic autonomy, King Mahendra, apparently a die-hard nationalist, also didn’t raise the issue of the 1950 treaty. Still, policy measures adopted by the royal government and India have led to the erosion of some treaty provisions. Coming close on the heels of the continuity of the relationship, the former foreign secretary and Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shyam Saran, said at a talk programme recently, “There will be more continuity than departure in India’s foreign policy in coming days–in rhetoric and style”. Then what alternative approach can Nepal take? I think focusing on the country’s development, projection of good governance and image by showing the ability to prosper and make people confident should be the strategy. If all-round development takes place by raising people's life standards, national confidence and maturity would grow, eventually leading to better cooperation with the immediate neighbours. The status of a nation is not raised by too much politicisation of relationships, as we have been witnessing for over six decades. Nor is foreign policy conducted through an emotional approach alone. Some developmental activities and formal and informal channels used by both sides to sort out immediate problems arising from time to time can measure how the two countries have stabilised bilateral relations and cooperative endeavours since the 1950s. Regime changes have not at all affected the continuity of the developmental process. Today, the development pace is faster than before. The political environment, irrespective of governments, is favourable, as parties and leaders seem to have understood the significance of development despite their subjective views on various issues. Now, Nepal and India have reached an understanding of purchasing 10000 megawatts of electricity by India and facilitating Nepal’s use of the Indian corridor for power sale to Bangladesh. Since Nepal and India are two separate nations politically and historically, civilisational commonalities do not always work when the question of nation-state arises. Therefore, it is natural that some divergent approaches to events and developments are noticed not to the extent of damaging the structure and dynamics of bilateral relationships. Some issues are perceived differently by the elites of the two countries. For example, some patches of the border often trigger controversy. The two governments have claimed that 97 percent of the border problem will be solved if both sides officially agree. But Nepal is not prepared to agree unless other disputed territories such as Sushta, Kalapanri-Lipulekh and Limpiadhura are settled. Sushta’s problem could have been settled long ago as it is not serious from an Indian security point of view. The Kalapani issue is complex because India considers it settled, but it contrasts with Nepal’s claim that goes far beyond the existing border. Since the newly adopted map called chuche naksa (pointed map) that shows the border up to Limpiadhura has already been passed by the Nepali Parliament by a two-thirds majority after reaching some sort of national consensus, it has become more complex. India reacted to Nepal’s action as a unilateral “cartographic assertion”, adding that the lands claimed by Nepal belong to India. The issue has become more complicated because of the long Indian rule (bhogchalan) and Nepal’s new claim as its territory. In addition to such complex issues, minor problems such as waterlogging in some parts of the Tarai, inundation, floods and trade deficit reduction are nagging. However, the issue of balance of trade entirely lies with Nepal’s capacity to enhance production and make Nepali products market-worthy in India and elsewhere. Only then can Nepal expect India’s cooperation to facilitate Nepali products to enter the Indian market. Mutual trust and confidence on both sides are essential to resolve ensuing differences, big or small. Moreover, perception, rather than reality, gives grounds for distrust. India should not be too suspicious of Nepal’s relations with China and other Western powers, especially the US, as it is armed with leverage over Nepal because, even if it wishes, the latter cannot cross the Rubicon due to various compulsions.   "},{"hash":"b22489a42af43c7ecedd6ae6f72841cbd7947cbf0bfcfc917060ed980e48a3b5","title":"distant-echoes-of-war","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/18/distant-echoes-of-war","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/DownShutterstock1-1718727369.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718668800000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"The day I met Rima (name changed), it was already late morning and she was anxious. There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rima’s body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rima’s house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rima’s quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepal’s decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepal’s conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepal’s history.Devi Khadka’s story had haunted me for years. I’d read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known ‘feminist’ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, it’s easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, “I’ve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.” Yet, some from Nepal’s transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her “political” and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. I’ve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, she’s been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepal’s transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as well—a way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepal’s transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepal’s wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal player—not a victim any more, but a leader—will strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist.

Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line.

Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us.

Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepal’s 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepal’s domestic airlines—nine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicopters—flew 4.15 million passengers in 2023.

Despite being an independent and a party member, they have had no visible disagreements.\n\nRecently, Dangol criticized Shah for his remarks against Prime Minister Oli over land corruption. She said they need to be mindful of their statements and respect everyone's opinions.\n\nShah had threatened to burn government buildings when traffic police stopped his wife's car. Dangol said this was wrong and that there should be no polarisation among Kathmandu representatives.","summary":"During the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu.

What concerns public virologists and infectious disease experts in Nepal is that less than one-fifth of cases of influenza-like illnesses are diagnosed, and neither the doctors attending patients nor the authorities concerned bother to know the real cause of ailments. They say that of the swab samples of 8,739 people with an influenza-like illness, only 1,743 tested positive for various kinds of influenza. “The cause of ailments of the rest of people are not known, which should be a cause of serious concern to the researchers as well as policymakers,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The criteria for collecting the swab samples for influenza test is that patients should have an influenza-like illness, but only less than one-fifth of samples are testing positive for influenza.”The laboratory only maintains a record of the positive cases but does not tell anything about fatalities due to infections. Experts say the number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than the data provided by the laboratory, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment.

It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says.

Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” ","summary":"Last month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite.

Doctors at the National Cardiac Center, who attended to the patient prescribed medicines and advised her to change her lifestyle and eating habits to control the ailments.“The patient, who was worried about her health conditions, took the doctors’ advice seriously and joined a yoga class in the morning, made a drastic change in her eating habits, and engaged in physical activities,” said Dr Om Murti Anil, a senior cardiologist. “Her blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels are now under control, and she has also reduced her weight. Now, she doesn't need the high dose of medicines like in the past. ”This was a common refrain among a few patients, who took doctors' advice seriously, changed their lifestyles and eating habits, joined yoga classes, and increased physical activity, which helped them control high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Public health experts say changing eating habits, lessening body weight, and starting physical activities, including yoga and physical exercises, help control non-communicable diseases, which have emerged as a major public health problem in Nepal.Studies show that non-communicable diseases have emerged as a serious public health issue in Nepal, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption—and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity. Doctors warn that non-communicable diseases—hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others—could lead to a public health crisis if not addressed immediately. They blame a sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of processed foods as chief culprits for the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and obesity.They warn that people from all walks of life have been affected by the repercussions of changing lifestyles and food habits. Entire family members suffer if any member, particularly the breadwinner, faces serious health problems.Experts say continuous awareness campaigns about the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the start of yoga classes in community centres, schools, and open-air gyms could help lessen the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. “Physical exercises not only help in managing the disease conditions but also lessen the risk of developing non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Munkarna Thapa, information officer at the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. “Along with physical fitness, they contribute to the mental well-being of people.”Meanwhile, department officials said that they have allocated a budget to promote open-air fitness centres, yoga classes, and alternatives, keeping in mind the growing burden of non-communicable diseases in society.Open-air gyms have been set up in public places, and the public can use them free of charge. Apart from setting up outdoor gyms, imparting training to communities and school students and promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce the major risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases, Thapa said.The department, which has already set up open-air fitness centres at the headquarters of all seven provinces, plans to set up 10 more such centres in the upcoming fiscal year. Several local units also have set up such facilities in their areas.

The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity. Doctors warn that non-communicable diseases—hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others—could lead to a public health crisis if not addressed immediately. They blame a sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of processed foods as chief culprits for the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and obesity.They warn that people from all walks of life have been affected by the repercussions of changing lifestyles and food habits. Entire family members suffer if any member, particularly the breadwinner, faces serious health problems.Experts say continuous awareness campaigns about the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the start of yoga classes in community centres, schools, and open-air gyms could help lessen the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. “Physical exercises not only help in managing the disease conditions but also lessen the risk of developing non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Munkarna Thapa, information officer at the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. “Along with physical fitness, they contribute to the mental well-being of people.”Meanwhile, department officials said that they have allocated a budget to promote open-air fitness centres, yoga classes, and alternatives, keeping in mind the growing burden of non-communicable diseases in society.Open-air gyms have been set up in public places, and the public can use them free of charge. Apart from setting up outdoor gyms, imparting training to communities and school students and promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce the major risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases, Thapa said.The department, which has already set up open-air fitness centres at the headquarters of all seven provinces, plans to set up 10 more such centres in the upcoming fiscal year. Several local units also have set up such facilities in their areas.

The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.The report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, but progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.The report shows that exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining, from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent last year. Health officials said that studies show that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies.According to the report, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing mothers’ education, from 12 percent among those whose mothers have no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile at 46 percent and lowest in the lowest quintile at 11 percent.Likewise, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province at 11 percent, in Madhesh Province at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province at 43 percent.Exclusive breastfeeding is the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and the lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.“We have allocated the nutrition budget to launch a nationwide awareness drive about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the upcoming fiscal year,” said Thapa. “We have also designated a nutrition focal person at every local unit who is tasked to discourage practices of promoting replacement feeding.”The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared with 12 percent of those born at home. Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children, according to the World Health Organisation.Health ministry officials hoped that training for nurses and paramedics would help lessen bottle-feeding practices in health facilities.Doctors say breastfeeding should continue for the first two years or beyond, as breast milk lowers children’s risk of illness, promotes their recovery during illness, and remains an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve ","summary":"Aditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York.

But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve "},{"hash":"4f18229de2a5d8016e8888758de34cc858e98af2b542ed3077fa8ab2d1e49a3b","title":"patience-passion-and-pastries","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2024/04/27/patience-passion-and-pastries","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/BakeleusbyCeleus-1714186343.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714176000000,"source":"kp","category":"recipes","content":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense.

According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many?

No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. ","summary":"“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal?

The island is believed to be the ancient kingdom of Ravana, as depicted in the Hindu epic, Ramayana. Visitors can explore significant sites associated with Ravana, such as the Rakwana Buddha statue, believed to have been built in Ravana's era. The Sita Eliya temple marks the spot where Ravana is said to have abducted Sita, the wife of Lord Rama. Exploring these sites offers a glimpse into Sri Lanka's fascinating cultural heritage and the enduring legacy of the demon king, Ravana.","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2024/06/21/sri-lanka-exploring-ravana-s-ancient-realm","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/srilanka00-1718977373.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718928000000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"We spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

Flames could be seen coming from inside.Police opened fire after tear gas and water cannon failed to disperse the crowds.A Reuters journalist counted the bodies of at least five protesters outside parliament. A paramedic, Vivian Achista, said at least 10 had been shot dead.Another paramedic, Richard Ngumo, said more than 50 people had been wounded by gunfire. He was lifting two injured protesters into an ambulance outside parliament.“We want to shut down parliament and every MP should go down and resign,” protestor Davis Tafari, who was trying to enter parliament, told Reuters. “We will have a new government.”Protests and clashes also took place in several other cities and towns across the country.Parliament approved the finance bill, moving it through to a third reading by lawmakers. The next step is for the legislation to be sent to the president for signing. He can send it back to parliament if he has any objections.The protesters oppose tax rises in a country already reeling from a cost-of-living crisis, and many are also calling for President William Ruto to step down.Ruto won an election almost two years ago on a platform of championing Kenya’s working poor, but has been caught between the competing demands of lenders such as the International Monetary Fund, which is urging the government to cut deficits to access more funding, and a hard-pressed population.Kenyans have been struggling to cope with several economic shocks caused by the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, two consecutive years of droughts and depreciation of the currency.The finance bill aims to raise an additional $2.7 billion in taxes as part of an effort to lighten the heavy debt load, with interest payments alone consuming 37% of annual revenue.The government has already made some concessions, promising to scrap proposed new taxes on bread, cooking oil, car ownership and financial transactions. But that has not been enough to satisfy protesters.Tuesday’s protests began in a festival-like atmosphere but as crowds swelled, police fired tear gas in Nairobi’s Central Business District and the poor neighbourhood of Kibera. Protesters ducked for cover and threw stones at police lines.Police also fired tear gas in Eldoret, Ruto’s hometown in western Kenya, where crowds of protesters filled the streets and many businesses were closed for fear of violence.Clashes also broke out in the coastal city of Mombasa and demonstrations took place in Kisumu, on Lake Victoria, and Garissa in eastern Kenya, where police blocked the main road to Somalia’s port of Kismayu.In Nairobi, people chanted “Ruto must go” and crowds sang in Swahili: “All can be possible without Ruto”. Music played from loudspeakers and protesters waved Kenyan flags and blew whistles in the few hours before the violence escalated.Police did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.Organic movementThousands had taken to the streets of Nairobi and several other cities during two days of protests last week as an online, youth-led movement gathered momentum.On Sunday, Ruto praised the protesters, saying they had been peaceful and that the government would engage with them on the way forward. But while protesters initially focused on the finance bill, their demands have broadened to demand Ruto’s resignation.The opposition declined to participate in the vote in parliament, shouting “reject, reject” when the house went through the items one by one. The bill will then be subjected to a third and final vote by acclamation on the floor of the house.The finance ministry says amendments would blow a 200 billion Kenyan shilling ($1.56 billion) hole in the 2024/25 budget, and compel the government to make spending cuts or raise taxes elsewhere.“They are budgeting for corruption,” said protester Hussein Ali, 18. “We won’t relent. It’s the government that is going to back off. Not us.” "},{"hash":"166139c633899c5de2a3491c6d1f1b9d2fb124eff6fa765d83e8bcbc79d1c950","title":"india-court-extends-suspension-of-bail-order-for-detained-delhi-chief-minister","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/06/25/india-court-extends-suspension-of-bail-order-for-detained-delhi-chief-minister","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/kejariwal-1719311801.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719273600000,"source":"kp","category":"world","content":"An Indian court on Tuesday extended a hold on a lower court’s order granting bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a graft case, leaving the key opposition leader in pre-trial detention.India’s federal financial crime-fighting agency arrested Kejriwal, a fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in March on corruption allegations relating to the capital’s liquor policy - accusations he has denied and said are politically motivated.Kejriwal was granted bail by a city court on Thursday but investigators challenged the order in the Delhi High Court, which suspended the bail order as it considered the challenge.

A spokesperson for Assange in Australia declined to comment on his flight plans. VistaJet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, has been pressing for Assange’s release but declined to comment on the legal proceedings as they were ongoing.“Prime Minister Albanese has been clear - Mr Assange’s case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration,” a government spokesperson said.A lawyer for Assange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.HISTORIC CHARGESWikiLeaks in 2010 released hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - the largest security breaches of their kind in US military history - along with swaths of diplomatic cables.Assange was indicted during former President Donald Trump’s administration over WikiLeaks’ mass release of secret US documents, which were leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former US military intelligence analyst who was also prosecuted under the Espionage Act.The trove of more than 700,000 documents included diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts such as a 2007 video of a US Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff. That video was released in 2010.The charges against Assange sparked outrage among his many global supporters who have long argued that Assange as the publisher of Wikileaks should not face charges typically used against federal government employees who steal or leak information.Many press freedom advocates have argued that criminally charging Assange represents a threat to free speech.“A plea deal would avert the worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of free speech organisation Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.“It will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.”LONG ODYSSEYAssange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a European arrest warrant after Swedish authorities said they wanted to question him over sex-crime allegations that were later dropped. He fled to Ecuador’s embassy, where he remained for seven years, to avoid extradition to Sweden.He was dragged out of the embassy in 2019 and jailed for skipping bail. He has been in London's Belmarsh top security jail ever since, from where he has for almost five years been fighting extradition to the United States.Those five years of confinement are similar to the sentence imposed on Reality Winner, an Air Force veteran and former intelligence contractor, who was sentenced to 63 months after she removed classified materials and mailed them to a news outlet.While in Belmarsh Assange married his partner Stella with whom he had two children while he was holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy. ","summary":"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is due to plead guilty this week to violating US espionage law, in a deal that will end his imprisonment in Britain and allow him to return home to Australia, ending a 14-year legal odyssey.Assange, 52, has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defence documents, according to filings in the US District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.He is due to be sentenced to 62 months of time already served at a hearing on the island of Saipan at 9am local time on Wednesday (2300 GMT Tuesday).Assange left Belmarsh prison in the UK on Monday before being bailed by the UK High Court and boarding a flight that afternoon, Wikileaks said in a statement posted on social media platform X.“This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations,” the statement said.A video posted on X by Wikileaks showed Assange dressed in a blue shirt and jeans signing a document before boarding a private jet with the markings of charter firm VistaJet.He will return to Australia after the hearing, the Wikileaks statement added, referring to the hearing in Saipan.“Julian is free!!!!” his wife, Stella Assange, said in a post on X.“Words cannot express our immense gratitude to YOU - yes YOU, who have all mobilised for years and years to make this come true.”The only VistaJet plane that departed Stansted on Monday afternoon was headed to Bangkok, FlightRadar24 data shows. A spokesperson for Assange in Australia declined to comment on his flight plans. VistaJet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, has been pressing for Assange’s release but declined to comment on the legal proceedings as they were ongoing.“Prime Minister Albanese has been clear - Mr Assange’s case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration,” a government spokesperson said.A lawyer for Assange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.HISTORIC CHARGESWikiLeaks in 2010 released hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - the largest security breaches of their kind in US military history - along with swaths of diplomatic cables.Assange was indicted during former President Donald Trump’s administration over WikiLeaks’ mass release of secret US documents, which were leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former US military intelligence analyst who was also prosecuted under the Espionage Act.The trove of more than 700,000 documents included diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts such as a 2007 video of a US Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff. That video was released in 2010.The charges against Assange sparked outrage among his many global supporters who have long argued that Assange as the publisher of Wikileaks should not face charges typically used against federal government employees who steal or leak information.Many press freedom advocates have argued that criminally charging Assange represents a threat to free speech.“A plea deal would avert the worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of free speech organisation Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.“It will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.”LONG ODYSSEYAssange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a European arrest warrant after Swedish authorities said they wanted to question him over sex-crime allegations that were later dropped. He fled to Ecuador’s embassy, where he remained for seven years, to avoid extradition to Sweden.He was dragged out of the embassy in 2019 and jailed for skipping bail. He has been in London's Belmarsh top security jail ever since, from where he has for almost five years been fighting extradition to the United States.Those five years of confinement are similar to the sentence imposed on Reality Winner, an Air Force veteran and former intelligence contractor, who was sentenced to 63 months after she removed classified materials and mailed them to a news outlet.While in Belmarsh Assange married his partner Stella with whom he had two children while he was holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem.

As the governments closest to the people, local levels create laws, formulate plans based on local needs and priorities, and efficiently use resources. They operate development projects in a participatory manner, fostering a sense of ownership. Their services include education, health, agriculture, waste management and local dispute resolution. According to Articles 214 and 221 of the 2015 Constitution, executive and legislative powers at the local level are vested in rural and municipal assemblies. The Local Government Operation Act (LG Act) further outlines responsibilities, including local taxes, basic services, development projects and public welfare. According to Section 102 of the LG Act, local levels can create and implement rules, guidelines, procedures and standards within their jurisdiction. The Auditor General of Nepal's 61st report (OAG report) mentions that the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration provided 52 model laws for local operations. However, the Legislative Management Committee of the National Assembly indicates that it needs six more laws for smooth operation.The Federation, Province and Local Level (Coordination and Inter-relation) Act 2020 or the Intergovernmental Relations Law (IGR Law) grant local levels the right to make laws within their exclusive and concurrent rights. Despite these provisions, local levels have not enacted the necessary regulations for effective fiscal resource mobilisation, development and service delivery, which has hindered their performance and service delivery.The IGR Law establishes a Provincial Coordination Council, chaired by the chief minister, to coordinate activities between provinces and local levels in policy coordination, strategic planning, use of shared jurisdiction, and natural resource management. Despite regular meetings, provinces have taken on projects meant for local levels, established redundant provincial offices, and failed to fully transfer funds to local levels. To enhance performance and balance development, provincial governments and local levels must coordinate effectively, holding regular meetings and making decisions to facilitate their tasks under concurrent rights.Regarding financial status, as stated by the OAG report, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022-23, the total revenue of the local level was about Rs672 billion, with 86 percent expenditure. Internal revenue, including revenue sharing (VAT and excise duty sharing), contributed 17 percent. Another 17 percent came from cash balance, i.e., the remaining budget from the previous year. The remaining revenue sources are fiscal transfers. The Ministry of Finance claims that revenue sharing and cash balance should also be counted as fiscal transfers, meaning that over 80 percent of local-level revenue comes from fiscal transfers.In FY 2021-22, the total internal revenue of the local levels was Rs35.75 billion, which declined to Rs33.67 billion in FY 2022-23. This indicates a lack of effort in collecting internal revenue, suggesting heavy dependence on fiscal transfers. In FY 2023-24, local levels received Rs295 billion in grants, which increased to Rs312 billion in FY 2024-25. However, the share of conditional grants rose from 65 percent in FY 2023-24 to 67 percent in FY 2024-25. Despite an overall budget increase of the federal government from Rs1751 billion to Rs1860 billion from FY 2023-24 to FY 2024-25, the unconditional grant to local levels increased by only Rs1 billion. The ratio of fiscal equalisation grants to the total GoN has declined from 14 percent in FY 2018-19 to 9 percent in FY 2024-25.Local levels have autonomy with fiscal equalisation grants, allowing them to choose programs and projects. However, over 80 percent of conditional grants go towards salaries and expenses for school teachers and other sectoral agency staff. The GoN has been reducing fiscal equalisation grants. The OAG report noted that Rs31 billion in fiscal equalisation grants was deducted towards the end of FY 2022-23. Additionally, a cabinet meeting on January 23, 2024, decided to reduce fiscal equalisation grants to sub-federal levels, including local levels, by 26 percent, amounting to Rs38 billion. This situation is deplorable for the local level. After facing intense criticism from the local level, two days ago, the government decided to release local-level funds, still withholding 7 percent of the necessary amount.The LG Act mandates internal audits of financial transactions, which, according to the OAG report, 307 local levels have not yet complied. Additionally, most local levels lack periodical development plans and fail to prepare medium-term expenditure frameworks. These frameworks should detail projected expenditures, required allocations, implementation timelines, funding sources, returns and achievements over three years. The failure to follow these requirements impacts the efficiency and transparency of local financial management.According to the law, local levels must submit their budgets by Ashad 10 (June 24). Most local levels, including Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), presented their budgets. KMC presented a budget amounting to Rs25.63 billion. However, dozens of local levels have not submitted their budgets. As stated in the OAG's report, four to five dozen local levels failed to submit their budgets on time from the very beginning.Legally, budgets must be allocated to specific programmes and projects, not kept in block form. Despite this, 291 local levels reserved Rs7.44 billion in unallocated funds, allowing executives to allocate and spend later, undermining fiscal discipline. This issue also exists at the provincial level. Although not a major issue, it significantly impacts the financial discipline.Section 83 of the LG Act mandates that local levels analyse their jurisdiction and workload and propose permanent job positions based on organisation and management surveys, with no temporary positions allowed. However, 229 local levels have spent Rs1.53 billion on salaries and allowances by appointing personnel on service contracts without established posts. 68.37 percent of local-level projects are under Rs500,000, while only 7.93 percent are over Rs2 million, indicating a prevalence of small projects. This issue is reflected in federal ministries; for example, the Ministry of Urban Development has 99 projects worth Rs100,000 each, and the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has 626 projects worth Rs500,000 each, as reported by Kantipur Daily on June 19, 2024.Local levels are responsible for providing accessible and quality services. However, service delivery has been ineffective due to unfilled staff positions, inadequate infrastructure and geographical challenges. Approximately 250 local levels lack a chief administrative officer, and the Ministry of Federal Affairs reports a shortage of about 30,000 staff due to delays in passing the Civil Service Bill.Additional issues include fragmented planning, fund transfers without implementation, overspending on unproductive programs and non-compliance with procurement laws. Ineffective service delivery also results from inadequate reviews of activities conducted at the local level, private sector, partnerships and civil organisations.Legal provisions exist for financial accountability through public hearings and social audits to ensure transparency and accountability. However, most local levels fail to clarify income and expenditure, performance status and contributions from consumer committees, neglecting public hearings and audits with stakeholders.Section 112 of the LG Act mandates that local levels create and implement a code of conduct for members and employees, covering transparency, accountability and avoiding conflicts of interest. Most local levels have not complied with this requirement. According to the OAG's report, seven local levels have not conducted a final audit or supported the auditing system. Additionally, some local levels failed to conduct audits for FY 2017-18 and FY 2021-22. Local levels neglecting the audit process and essential services should face penalties, such as reductions in their equalisation grants. These grants should be transferred to other local levels within the same province, demonstrating effective work and adherence to rules and regulations.Local levels must address these fiscal and administrative challenges to ensure effective governance and service delivery. Proper coordination with provincial governments, adherence to legal mandates, and a focus on transparency and accountability are essential for improving local governments' performance and trust.

Wade was overturned, there's reason to believe reproductive rights could affect the outcome of the US presidential race.Donald Trump's term as president left a devastating legacy for reproductive rights in the United States.Now, as Trump vies again for the presidency, his anti-abortion stance could come back to bite him.There has been a subtle but noticeable shift among some Republicans away from a hardline anti-abortion stance. And this month, the US Supreme Court rejected a bid to limit access to a common abortion pill—the latest in a string of wins for reproductive rights in the US.But the extent to which reproductive rights will impact the presidential election result in November will depend on several factors, including whether pro-choice voters go to the polls in sufficient numbers to tip the balance in key states.How Trump damaged reproductive rightsTrump's victory in 2016 has proved to be one of the most consequential events in shaping Americans' reproductive rights in the last 50 years.In that campaign, Trump—who once called himself \"the most pro-life president ever\"—promised to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 US Supreme Court decision that established a person's right to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability.After he took office in 2017, Trump delivered on that pledge—appointing three justices who, in June 2022, went on to join the six-vote majority that overturned the Roe decision.Following this ruling, Dobbs v. Jackson, old state laws criminalising abortion went back into effect, and some state legislatures have sought new ways to limit access to reproductive care.Fourteen states now criminalise abortion in all circumstances except some medical emergencies, and three others ban the procedure after six weeks—before many women even know they are pregnant.More than 29 million women of childbearing age live in states with total or near-total bans on abortion.Despite these dramatic changes to reproductive rights, polls consistently show that fewer than one in five Americans (across all genders) believes abortion should be banned in all circumstances.A 2024 Pew survey found that 63 percent of Americans, including 64 percent of women, believe abortion should be legal in \"all or most cases\".The consequences of the Dobbs decision have mostly been felt in private, as many women are now forced to quietly travel across state lines for reproductive care. But news reports of some high-profile cases have put the spotlight on stories of women being denied terminations of pregnancies that are nonviable or dangerous to the woman's health.A Louisiana woman whose fetus had no skull was forced to travel to New York to terminate her pregnancy. A Texas woman, Kate Cox, was denied an exemption from the state's abortion ban to terminate her pregnancy. Her fetus was afflicted with Trisomy 18, a devastating chromosomal condition that nearly always results in stillbirth or death within the first year of life.Other women and their families worry that medical professionals in states with abortion bans, wary of losing their medical licences or being sued, limit information about dangerous pregnancies to the detriment of their patients.Pro-choice voter stancesGiven this state of affairs, there is much conjecture on what the end of Roe might mean for November's presidential election.The issue of abortion access has proven to drive voter turnout in state elections in the wake of Dobbs.In a series of referenda, voters have sought to protect reproductive rights.In 2022, Kansas and Kentucky voters rejected amendments that would have declared that their state constitutions did not protect abortion rights. Michigan voters added an amendment protecting abortion access to their state's constitution. In November 2023, Ohio residents voted in favour of an amendment to that state's constitution that protects abortion access. These were all states won by Trump in 2016.There is more evidence that the issue of reproductive rights influences the outcomes of elections. In the 2022 midterm elections, support for abortion rights contributed to better-than-expected results for Democratic candidates.A recent Gallup poll shows that 54 percent of voters now identify as pro-choice, while the share of voters who view abortion as \"morally wrong\" has dipped to 37 percent from 50 percent in 2019. The same poll revealed that nearly twice as many voters who favour abortion access say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views on the subject as compared to those who oppose abortion.The increased fervour to protect abortion access is primarily concentrated among those who already vote for Democratic candidates. And midterm elections typically have lower voter turnout than presidential elections.What will happen in November is dependent on whether these voters go to the polls in sufficient numbers to tip the balance in statewide elections. (The United States uses an electoral college system for presidential elections that awards votes to the winner of the popular vote in that state.)At the same time, there is evidence that the fallout from the Dobbs decision is already shaping Republican politics.Abortion bans are not popular with a majority of voters. This has left Republicans on the defensive. There is some evidence that some Republicans are backing away from hardline pro-life stances.Trump himself has not yet clarified his abortion policy during his 2024 campaign. He has said, however, that voters in each state should decide the rules governing abortion, not lawmakers in Washington.In several swing states, pro-choice stances have had success this year.In Arizona, where the state supreme court recently allowed a Civil War-era abortion ban to go back into effect, the legislature recently voted to repeal the law. Both houses of the legislature are controlled by Republicans. Trump won Arizona in 2016, but Biden prevailed there in 2020.Abortion rights will be on the ballot in some other key states in November. In Florida—another battleground state—voters will decide whether to inscribe abortion access until fetal viability in the state constitution via a referendum. Similar measures will likely be on the ballot in Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, South Dakota and a handful of other states.If the 2022 midterm elections are instructive, it appears that access to reproductive rights will shape at least some state elections this year—and the flow-on effects may well affect the outcome of the presidential race. ","summary":"Two years since Roe v. Wade was overturned, there's reason to believe reproductive rights could affect the outcome of the US presidential race.Donald Trump's term as president left a devastating legacy for reproductive rights in the United States.Now, as Trump vies again for the presidency, his anti-abortion stance could come back to bite him.There has been a subtle but noticeable shift among some Republicans away from a hardline anti-abortion stance. And this month, the US Supreme Court rejected a bid to limit access to a common abortion pill—the latest in a string of wins for reproductive rights in the US.But the extent to which reproductive rights will impact the presidential election result in November will depend on several factors, including whether pro-choice voters go to the polls in sufficient numbers to tip the balance in key states.How Trump damaged reproductive rightsTrump's victory in 2016 has proved to be one of the most consequential events in shaping Americans' reproductive rights in the last 50 years.In that campaign, Trump—who once called himself \"the most pro-life president ever\"—promised to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 US Supreme Court decision that established a person's right to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability.After he took office in 2017, Trump delivered on that pledge—appointing three justices who, in June 2022, went on to join the six-vote majority that overturned the Roe decision.Following this ruling, Dobbs v. Jackson, old state laws criminalising abortion went back into effect, and some state legislatures have sought new ways to limit access to reproductive care.Fourteen states now criminalise abortion in all circumstances except some medical emergencies, and three others ban the procedure after six weeks—before many women even know they are pregnant.More than 29 million women of childbearing age live in states with total or near-total bans on abortion.Despite these dramatic changes to reproductive rights, polls consistently show that fewer than one in five Americans (across all genders) believes abortion should be banned in all circumstances.A 2024 Pew survey found that 63 percent of Americans, including 64 percent of women, believe abortion should be legal in \"all or most cases\".The consequences of the Dobbs decision have mostly been felt in private, as many women are now forced to quietly travel across state lines for reproductive care. But news reports of some high-profile cases have put the spotlight on stories of women being denied terminations of pregnancies that are nonviable or dangerous to the woman's health.A Louisiana woman whose fetus had no skull was forced to travel to New York to terminate her pregnancy. A Texas woman, Kate Cox, was denied an exemption from the state's abortion ban to terminate her pregnancy. Her fetus was afflicted with Trisomy 18, a devastating chromosomal condition that nearly always results in stillbirth or death within the first year of life.Other women and their families worry that medical professionals in states with abortion bans, wary of losing their medical licences or being sued, limit information about dangerous pregnancies to the detriment of their patients.Pro-choice voter stancesGiven this state of affairs, there is much conjecture on what the end of Roe might mean for November's presidential election.The issue of abortion access has proven to drive voter turnout in state elections in the wake of Dobbs.In a series of referenda, voters have sought to protect reproductive rights.In 2022, Kansas and Kentucky voters rejected amendments that would have declared that their state constitutions did not protect abortion rights. Michigan voters added an amendment protecting abortion access to their state's constitution. In November 2023, Ohio residents voted in favour of an amendment to that state's constitution that protects abortion access. These were all states won by Trump in 2016.There is more evidence that the issue of reproductive rights influences the outcomes of elections. In the 2022 midterm elections, support for abortion rights contributed to better-than-expected results for Democratic candidates.A recent Gallup poll shows that 54 percent of voters now identify as pro-choice, while the share of voters who view abortion as \"morally wrong\" has dipped to 37 percent from 50 percent in 2019.

The victim was staying in a chhau goth, or menstrual shed, at her maternal uncle’s home when she was violated by her distant relative. After years of awareness campaigns and the breaking of chhau sheds by central and local governments as well as non-governmental agencies, the victimisation of women remains a daily occurrence in several parts of Nepal, especially Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005; in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But the inhumane practice remains deeply rooted in parts of Nepali society.
