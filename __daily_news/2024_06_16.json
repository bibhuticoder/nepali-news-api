This was the first time the two teams were ever playing. After winning the toss, Captain Rohit Paudel invited South Africa to bat first. Proving their captain's decision right, the Nepali bowlers restricted South Africa to 115 runs for 7 wickets in 20 overs.\n  In restricting the opponents to a partly total, Kushal Bhurtel took 4 wickets giving away just 19 runs in his quota of 4 overs.

Tristan Stubbs scored 27 runs in 18 balls while other batsmen failed to make any significant impact.\nNepal's chase got to a good start with both the openers seeing through the power play, without giving away their wicket and scoring 32 runs in 6 overs. However, with the introduction of spin, Nepal lost ground and lost two wickets while scoring 16 runs in the next four overs. Nepal were 48/2 at the half hour mark i.e. 10 overs.\nNepal lost opener Kushal Bhurtel who scored 13 runs in 21 balls, including a four and a six. Captain Rohit Paudel was out duck facing 2 balls. Both fell at the same over, bowled by Tabraiz Shamsim, whose 4 overs costing Nepal 4 wickets proved the difference. After applying the brakes in the 7th over with 2 wickets, Shamsim came back to haunt Nepal by taking another 2 wickets in a single over in the 17th over. Dipendra Singh Airee 6 (11) was caught behind while the set batsman Aasif Sheikh 42 (49) was clean bowled by Shamshim, who was later adjudged the player-of-the-match.\nWith 12 runs needed in the last two overs, the experienced Kushal Malla fell to Anrich Nortje scoring only 1 run in 3 overs. It was now left to new batsman Gulshan Jha and Sompal Kami, only player to have played the previous T20 World Cup when Nepal had last qualified in 2014.\nSompal Kami scored a huge six in the 18th over, bringing down the equation to 8 runs in the last six balls. New batsman Jha was on the crease to face the final over bowled by Ottneil Baartman. The first two balls he failed to put bat on ball, but scored the third ball for a four. He then scored two runs in the fourth ball, leaving only two runs to get from the last two balls. However, he failed to put bat on ball and was run out trying to steal a run to take the match to super over.\nIt was in similar circumstances that Nepal was out of the previous T20 World Cup it qualified in 2014. Nepal defeated fellow associates Hong Kong and Afghanistan but suffered a loss to the host, Bangladesh. Despite the two wins, Nepal couldn’t advance to the next round due to a lower net run rate. Hence, Nepal has been proved second time unlucky, going out after putting up a good display against a test side.\nIt was a must win match for Nepal today to have any chance of making it to the last eight. South Africa had already qualified for the Super Eight from Group D, also including the Netherlands, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\nPrior to this match, Nepal had collected just one point after one loss and a draw.

The slogan of the program, “Social Creatinnovation for the Sustainable Future of Nepal,” encapsulates its ethos of fostering innovation for societal progress.\nDuring the ceremony, UGC Chairman Dr. Adhikari stated that the TU MBA GLM program empowers students to innovate and launch startups, aligning with job market demands. He also highlighted that collaborations with foreign universities help internationalize Nepal's higher education. Additionally, the attending Secretary, Mr. Kaphle, stressed that the joint program has been instrumental in fostering innovative leadership and addressing societal challenges in Nepal, conveying appreciation for Korea’s invaluable support in strengthening education capabilities in Nepal.\nThe 10th-anniversary celebration holds particular significance as it coincides with the 50th year of diplomatic relations between Korea and Nepal. Ambassador Park, in his address, congratulated the program on its milestone achievement and the enduring partnership between the two universities. Furthermore he highlighted the Korean government's commitment to the development in Nepal's education and vocational training sector. He affirmed that such initiatives align with Korea's enduring support to Nepal as a steadfast development partner.\nHaving designated Nepal as a “Priority Cooperation Country” for 15 consecutive years in development cooperation, the Korean government has consistently provided diverse assistance in key areas, including education & vocational training, health, agriculture, rural development, and energy.\nEducation and vocational training are among Korea’s top prioritized sectors in Nepal. The Korean government has provided substantial support to Nepal, including USD 200.01 million allocated through KOICA since 1991. Besides this, the Korean government has supported talented individuals from Nepal through the Global Korea Scholarship program, providing scholarships for degree programs. Additionally, through the Leading University Project for International Cooperation, Korean universities share their academic systems and curriculums with Nepalese universities, including Tribhuvan University and Kathmandu University, contributing to the enhancement of higher education capacity.\nAs this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Korea and Nepal, the Korean government has commemorated this milestone with various projects and programs. These initiatives aim to further expand bilateral cooperation across diverse fields between the two nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"hash":"796d29557793d321ff386b57661b9be5e19f7d4d2dfbee7f0d82dc0615482f3b","title":"weather-update-57","date":1718323200000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/nation/weather-update-57","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/hot_weather1687700628_1024.webp","category":"nation","content":"\nToday\nPartly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province and Madesh Province along with the hilly regions of Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair in rest of the country.

The report said this highlights the challenge of finding jobs for youths in Nepal. The survey report shows joblessness among people between the ages of 15 and 24 declined to 22.7 percent in 2022-23 from 23.9 percent in 2017-18.“Most worrying is the rise in unemployment in the past five years, which increased by 1.2 percent, and that’s worrisome,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the statistics office. “The economy has failed to generate enough jobs for its large and expanding young population.”The population structure has shifted towards a younger working-age population, with a decrease in the proportion of children (0-14 years) and an increase in the proportion of adults (15-59 years).This trend is further supported by a declining dependency ratio, suggesting a growing workforce. The proportion of the elderly population (60 years and above) has increased.Regmi said the age between 15 and 24, the most productive time for an individual, is not considered the working age in Nepal, as these people are involved in education and training.“At this age, our survey has found, people will work only if they are offered a job. The responsibility to earn money grows in later years.”The survey data on employment status reveals significant shifts in the labour market between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of those with jobs has declined considerably from 67.2 percent in 1995-96 to 32.4 percent in 2022-23, while the percentage of those not in the labour force has increased from 29.4 percent to 62.9 percent.The share of wage employment in agriculture has significantly declined from 70.7 percent in 1995-96 to 1.9 percent in 2022-23. The share of wage employment in non-agriculture, on the other hand, has risen considerably from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 56.6 percent in 2022-23.The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed.The labour force participation rate came down to 37.1 percent in 2022-23 from 38.2 percent five years ago.“The employment condition in Nepal is the worst,” said economist Pushkar Bajracharya. “The government failed to create jobs. This is because the investment environment has not been favourable in past years, mainly due to political and policy uncertainty. When there is no investment, there is no job creation.”Bajracharya said the unemployment rate would further jump due to the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the recession and slowdown the country has seen.“Many industries, service sectors and companies are still laying off workers due to the economic slowdown. There is low demand for labour in the country as the key economic sectors—construction and manufacturing—are facing recession, while wholesale and retail have shown a slight recovery,” said Bajracharya. Experts say that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the jobs being created in Nepal’s economy are not of quality. There is a need for new strategies, new partners, and new goals.Each year, around a million Nepali youths, including students, leave the country to try their luck abroad.The survey data on remittances and transfers reveals a significant increase in the prevalence and magnitude of remittances received by households in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23.The percentage of households receiving remittances has increased dramatically from 23.4 percent in 1995-96 to 76.8 percent in 2022-23, indicating a significant rise in the number of Nepali families relying on the money sent by their members working abroad.This increase is consistent with the observed growth in average remittances per household, which has significantly increased from Rs15,160 in 1995-96 to Rs145,093 in 2022-23.Remittances (other than from India) are quite dominant, highlighting the importance of international migration for income generation.Remittances from India declined from 32.9 percent in 1995-96 to 11.1 percent in 2010-11, but they have increased since, reaching 21.3 percent in 2022-23, according to the survey report.The survey data on household loans shows that the percentage of families borrowing money is relatively stable (61.3 percent in 1995-96 and 63.8 percent in 2022-23). However, the percentage of households with outstanding loans has significantly increased, from 58.4 percent in 1995-96 to 97.3 percent in 2022-23.The data also reveals a shift in the sources of household loans. Traditional money lenders were previously a dominant source (39.7 percent in 1995-96), but their share significantly decreased to 11.4 percent in 2022-23.The share of loans from banks has increased (from 16.1 percent in 1995-96 to 22.4 percent in 2022-23), while loans from relatives continue to remain significant (40.8 percent in 1995-96 to 42.5 percent in 2022-23).Household consumption as a reason for borrowing has been declining (from 49.4 percent in 1995-96 to 23.5 percent in 2022-23). This could be attributed to improved access to essential goods and services or a shift to other borrowing needs, the survey report shows.The use of collateral has also shifted, with an increase in the proportion of loans taken with collateral. While 16.8 percent of loans were taken with land and house collateral in 1995-96, this share increased to 35.1 percent in 2022-23.The data shows a noticeable shift in the dominant sectors of non-farm activities. While trade was previously the most prevalent sector (52.1 percent in 1995-96), it has declined (42.5 percent in 2022-23). The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23.Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support.Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72.Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent.According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23.Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867.The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income.The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23.The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population.This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23.The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23.This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23.The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases.There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices. A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices.Cold/fever remains a significant concern, increasing from 43.7 percent in 1995-96 to 51.5 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of those consulting a doctor has remained relatively stable (around 29 percent), and the percentage consulting a paramedic has significantly decreased.Migration patterns within Nepal reveal significant shifts in trends between 2003-04 and 2022-23. While the overall percentage of the migrant population within the country has remained relatively stable—36.6 percent in 2003-04 and 38.1 percent in 2022-23—there is a notable shift in the gender composition of migrants.Males constituted a higher proportion of migrants in 2003-04 (50.1 percent), but females made a larger share of the migrant population (49.6 percent) in 2022-23. A decline in the percentage of migrants from rural areas in 2022-23 indicates a potential shift in migration patterns, possibly driven by changing economic opportunities and societal factors.The analysis of reasons for migration reveals that family remains the dominant factor (75.2 percent in 2003-04 moving within the country for family reasons and 74.9 percent in 2022-23).The fourth Nepal Living Standards Survey, conducted in 2022-23, is the first such survey since the country’s transition to a federal system. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 9,600 households on a wide range of topics. ","summary":"Nepal’s unemployment rate has been increasing, according to a report.The fourth Nepal Living Standard Survey report, published by the National Statistics Office on Thursday, shows that the unemployment rate climbed up to 12.6 percent in 2022-23 from 11.4 percent in 2017-18, representing a 1.2 percent rise in the five-year period.The unemployment rate has risen from 4.9 percent in 1995-96 to 12.6 percent in 2022-23.This rise is more pronounced among younger workers, with the unemployment rate for those aged 15-24 jumping from 7.3 percent in 1995-96 to 22.7 percent in 2022-23. The report said this highlights the challenge of finding jobs for youths in Nepal. The survey report shows joblessness among people between the ages of 15 and 24 declined to 22.7 percent in 2022-23 from 23.9 percent in 2017-18.“Most worrying is the rise in unemployment in the past five years, which increased by 1.2 percent, and that’s worrisome,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the statistics office. “The economy has failed to generate enough jobs for its large and expanding young population.”The population structure has shifted towards a younger working-age population, with a decrease in the proportion of children (0-14 years) and an increase in the proportion of adults (15-59 years).This trend is further supported by a declining dependency ratio, suggesting a growing workforce. The proportion of the elderly population (60 years and above) has increased.Regmi said the age between 15 and 24, the most productive time for an individual, is not considered the working age in Nepal, as these people are involved in education and training.“At this age, our survey has found, people will work only if they are offered a job. The responsibility to earn money grows in later years.”The survey data on employment status reveals significant shifts in the labour market between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of those with jobs has declined considerably from 67.2 percent in 1995-96 to 32.4 percent in 2022-23, while the percentage of those not in the labour force has increased from 29.4 percent to 62.9 percent.The share of wage employment in agriculture has significantly declined from 70.7 percent in 1995-96 to 1.9 percent in 2022-23. The share of wage employment in non-agriculture, on the other hand, has risen considerably from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 56.6 percent in 2022-23.The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed.The labour force participation rate came down to 37.1 percent in 2022-23 from 38.2 percent five years ago.“The employment condition in Nepal is the worst,” said economist Pushkar Bajracharya. “The government failed to create jobs. This is because the investment environment has not been favourable in past years, mainly due to political and policy uncertainty. When there is no investment, there is no job creation.”Bajracharya said the unemployment rate would further jump due to the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the recession and slowdown the country has seen.“Many industries, service sectors and companies are still laying off workers due to the economic slowdown. There is low demand for labour in the country as the key economic sectors—construction and manufacturing—are facing recession, while wholesale and retail have shown a slight recovery,” said Bajracharya. Experts say that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the jobs being created in Nepal’s economy are not of quality. There is a need for new strategies, new partners, and new goals.Each year, around a million Nepali youths, including students, leave the country to try their luck abroad.The survey data on remittances and transfers reveals a significant increase in the prevalence and magnitude of remittances received by households in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23.The percentage of households receiving remittances has increased dramatically from 23.4 percent in 1995-96 to 76.8 percent in 2022-23, indicating a significant rise in the number of Nepali families relying on the money sent by their members working abroad.This increase is consistent with the observed growth in average remittances per household, which has significantly increased from Rs15,160 in 1995-96 to Rs145,093 in 2022-23.Remittances (other than from India) are quite dominant, highlighting the importance of international migration for income generation.Remittances from India declined from 32.9 percent in 1995-96 to 11.1 percent in 2010-11, but they have increased since, reaching 21.3 percent in 2022-23, according to the survey report.The survey data on household loans shows that the percentage of families borrowing money is relatively stable (61.3 percent in 1995-96 and 63.8 percent in 2022-23). However, the percentage of households with outstanding loans has significantly increased, from 58.4 percent in 1995-96 to 97.3 percent in 2022-23.The data also reveals a shift in the sources of household loans. Traditional money lenders were previously a dominant source (39.7 percent in 1995-96), but their share significantly decreased to 11.4 percent in 2022-23.The share of loans from banks has increased (from 16.1 percent in 1995-96 to 22.4 percent in 2022-23), while loans from relatives continue to remain significant (40.8 percent in 1995-96 to 42.5 percent in 2022-23).Household consumption as a reason for borrowing has been declining (from 49.4 percent in 1995-96 to 23.5 percent in 2022-23). This could be attributed to improved access to essential goods and services or a shift to other borrowing needs, the survey report shows.The use of collateral has also shifted, with an increase in the proportion of loans taken with collateral. While 16.8 percent of loans were taken with land and house collateral in 1995-96, this share increased to 35.1 percent in 2022-23.The data shows a noticeable shift in the dominant sectors of non-farm activities. While trade was previously the most prevalent sector (52.1 percent in 1995-96), it has declined (42.5 percent in 2022-23). The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23.Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support.Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72.Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent.According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23.Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867.The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income.The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23.The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population.This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23.The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23.This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23.The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases.There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices.

Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government?Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government.Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises.Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet.After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently.“We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post.Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam.“The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.”After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls.During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said.“However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.”Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K.The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television.“Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.”But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.” ","summary":"What’s cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party?

Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television.“Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.”But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.” "},{"hash":"58be7d6389ddfdcc3f1d39c6277506c7adf8323a4e5145974e2960e0160f308a","title":"constitutional-council-nominates-krishna-man-pradhan-as-election-commissioner","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/16/constitutional-council-nominates-krishna-man-pradhan-as-election-commissioner","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/krishnamanpradhan-1718548667.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718496000000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"Krishna Man Pradhan has been recommended for the post of election commissioner.According to Deputy Speaker Indira Rana, the Constitutional Council’s meeting on Sunday decided to recommend Pradhan for the position.Rana said no discussions were held on making appointments to other vacant positions of constitutional bodies.Pradhan is the executive director of the Nepal Law Society.

The theme for this year’s World Environment Day, emphasising land restoration, combating desertification and building resilience to drought, encompasses the pressing issues of this era which need careful intervention. The scale and intensity of the impacts of land degradation, desertification and drought are alarming. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) states that up to 40 percent of the world’s land is degraded, adversely impacting around 3.2 billion people. Projections also indicate that over three-quarters of the world's population by 2050 will be affected by drought. These impacts manifest in several aspects of life and nature, including loss of biodiversity and ecosystems, depletion of resources, food insecurity, livelihood and ultimate human existence. In recent times, land degradation induced by physical, chemical and biological processes has been accelerated by human activities. The main culprits include haphazard infrastructure development, industrialisation, high carbon-intensive energy use, overgrazing and excessive extraction of natural resources without consideration of environmental sustainability. Prolonged droughts are becoming more common and climate change adds uncertainty and complexities to their occurrences. Nepal’s vulnerabilityNepal’s young mountains are geologically fragile and complex. Located in a tectonically active zone, the whole land mass from the Himalayas in the North to the Siwalik in the South is susceptible to peculiar challenges, especially erosion, landslides and floods. Anthropogenic activities in this hazard-prone region, including haphazard infrastructure construction, land use change, and chemical fertiliser and pesticide overuse, exacerbate these natural phenomena. For instance, road construction on the slopes without due consideration to the environment and slope stabilisation in the last decade has increased incidents of landslides and slope failures. Excessive extraction of resources from rivers is another concern. While regulatory provisions in the Environment Protection Act and Regulation mandate comprehensive assessment, project developers often perceive such provisions as a burden. Limited focus on the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan, compliance monitoring and evaluation, and audits are the reasons behind haphazard resource extraction and the continuation of environmentally unsustainable projects.Soil loss through erosion, a serious threat to soil health, results in agricultural yield decline, ecosystem degradation, habitat destruction and several economic impacts. A 2016 study by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) estimated 40 million tons of soil loss between 1990 and 2010 in the Koshi basin. Identification of arable soil loss areas is critical for effective land management planning focused on conservation measures. The 61st report of the Office of the Auditor General pointed out that the content of soil organic matter currently stands at 2.83 against the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 3.37. Policy interventionsA 2018 report titled “Land degradation neutrality target setting program in Nepal” set three targets to be achieved by 2030: i) Increase forest cover to 44.7 percent; ii) increase agricultural growth by 6 percent; iii) increase Soil Organic Carbon in forest and cropland by 1 percent per annum and iv) restoring 10 percent of wetland ecosystem out of 26277 sq. hectares of wetlands. Among these, Nepal’s success in increasing forest cover from 39.6 percent in 1993 to 44.74 percent in 2018 is praised all over the world as one of the best-case examples of sustainable forest management initiatives. Despite this achievement, the recent episodes of forest fires during the pre-monsoon period are worrisome. The attainment of other targets requires concentrated effort by building synergies and collaboration among national policies/strategies and different climate action programmes. For instance, Land Use Policy, Agriculture Development Strategy, Nepal Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and Climate Change Policy are required to be aligned on its objectives, strategies and programmes. At the programme level, for instance, the National Climate Change Support Programme, the National Adaptation Plan, and the President Chure Terai Madesh Conservation Programme need to focus on a collaborative approach; eliminating duplication and creating synergies among beneficiaries and outcome of this programme. Research on drought shows an increasing trend in both the intensity and frequency of drought occurrences. The impacts of drought are significantly higher in rain-fed agricultural regions like Nepal, which rely extensively on the monsoon. Droughts result in crop failures and food insecurity, which is why region-specific explorations of droughts are essential for effective drought monitoring and risk mitigation. A 2021 study indicated that summer drought events have increased fivefold in the central region, doubled in the eastern region, and not significantly changed in the western region of Nepal. These incidences have severe implications for vulnerable communities that are mostly dependent on subsentence agriculture for their livelihood. As a result, difficulty in local livelihoods prevails, which acts as a “push factor” leading to increased migration from rural to urban city centres and abroad. Soil healthHealthy soil is the foundation not only of agricultural systems and food security but also of the existence of humans. So, data management should be a priority towards understanding and analysing the pattern, trend and hotspots of land degradation and droughts.

Take, for example, the recent directive by Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to deploy traffic rule violators for traffic management. Thankfully, Lamichhane’s directive was overturned by the Supreme Court. The Kathmandu Road Division’s hasty decision to blacktop the road section the Kathmandu Metropolitan City had prepared for footpath extension is another example.It is striking how Lamichhane—a journalist-turned-politician and a former vocal critic of the ministers from parties he now aligns with—turned out no different. He is just as unscrupulous and power-hungry as the old guard, doing everything he can to remain in power and satisfy his political ambitions. Such a hunger for power leads him to make hasty and moody decisions, further augmenting the burden on the economy and society. This piece will analyse the economic cost of such decisions later, but first, let’s understand the reasons behind the pomposity of the leaders. One must understand political schooling to understand why Nepali politicians, new and old, formulate bizarre policies. What are the qualifications to become a politician, let alone a minister, in Nepal? It is anything but education and expertise. The current federal Cabinet of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and state and local level governments are not far from any of this. Most of them are no experts, nor do they hold the required knowledge to run their positions. The irony is that we have a government where a journalist becomes the home minister, a former rebel commander becomes the finance minister, and someone who lost the election becomes the minister of foreign affairs, home affairs, and physical infrastructure and transportation, all within a year under the same prime ministership. How can one person seamlessly transition between ministries overnight and suddenly become an expert in each field? ConsequencesThe lack of proper education and thorough understanding of the policymakers’ responsibilities is causing serious problems at the policy level. This is the main reason for their narrow-mindedness—their inability to accept diversity and expert opinions—and to understand complex social and economic phenomena, which leads them to have a “holier-than-thou” and “I am the law” attitude. Huge economic costs and unnecessary social burdens come with that. Every economic policy comes with economic and social costs. Economic costs are of two types: Direct costs and opportunity costs. Direct costs are the actual tangible expenditures associated with implementing a policy and can be easily measured. Opportunity costs are implicit and come with forgone policy alternatives. These are difficult to measure, yet are crucial for policy evaluation, as they directly affect overall output or the economy. For example, had the home minister's recent ruling not been halted by the Supreme Court, it would have cost the nation an estimated Rs250 million a year. This calculation is based on the daily productivity of an individual ($1434/365) at the current exchange rate (Rs133.25/USD) and 1,300 incidences per day. The recent impulsive decision by the Road Department, under Raghuvir Mahaseth, to blacktop a section of the New Road, led to financial costs. If the minister were concerned about the people and the economy, he would have worked to speed up the construction of the remaining section of the Ring Road, which has far more important economic, social, and health and environmental concerns. As a result of these difficulties, households are bearing extra social costs, and the retail and service economies are losing productivity in the area due to a lack of proper infrastructure and environmental quality. Further, this will only increase the cost of production over time and reduce the country’s output because of fewer economic activities. Similarly, the former finance minister Janardan Sharma’s controversial tax policy and the current finance minister Barsha Man Pun's ineffective policy of distributing the budget for their cadres through popular programmes such as the Prime Minister Daughter Resilient Programme—when similar programmes like former PM KP Oli’s Prime Minister Employment Programme turned into white elephants—will add further burden. The inconsistency in the government’s policies, such as reducing tax last year and increasing this year on electric vehicles, shows a lack of understanding of the matter. These are just a few examples of irrational and farfetched laws and policies of the past and incumbent governments. The politicians’ behaviours and self-righteous actions put a huge economic, social and environmental toll on the nation. Additionally, policies that lead to the depletion of natural resources and allocation of public property to private politicians’ cronies result from the irresponsibility of the leaders. Not to forget, the decisions of the former government led by KP Oli to allow the commercialisation and export of natural resources from the Chure region and swap the land of the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate are no less concerning. There should be stringent mechanisms to control politicians’ reckless decisions. Though the Supreme Court has been overturning such steps, self-fulfilling politicians like those in the current and past governments remain a nuisance. Politicians must be made responsible for their deeds, even if they do not trigger corruption cases. Publicising cost-benefit analysis before formulating any such policies and regulations should be made mandatory. Otherwise, no matter whether the old or the new leaders make it to the government with their chicaneries, Nepal will continue to bear economic, social and environmental costs.

These are difficult to measure, yet are crucial for policy evaluation, as they directly affect overall output or the economy. For example, had the home minister's recent ruling not been halted by the Supreme Court, it would have cost the nation an estimated Rs250 million a year. This calculation is based on the daily productivity of an individual ($1434/365) at the current exchange rate (Rs133.25/USD) and 1,300 incidences per day. The recent impulsive decision by the Road Department, under Raghuvir Mahaseth, to blacktop a section of the New Road, led to financial costs. If the minister were concerned about the people and the economy, he would have worked to speed up the construction of the remaining section of the Ring Road, which has far more important economic, social, and health and environmental concerns. As a result of these difficulties, households are bearing extra social costs, and the retail and service economies are losing productivity in the area due to a lack of proper infrastructure and environmental quality. Further, this will only increase the cost of production over time and reduce the country’s output because of fewer economic activities. Similarly, the former finance minister Janardan Sharma’s controversial tax policy and the current finance minister Barsha Man Pun's ineffective policy of distributing the budget for their cadres through popular programmes such as the Prime Minister Daughter Resilient Programme—when similar programmes like former PM KP Oli’s Prime Minister Employment Programme turned into white elephants—will add further burden. The inconsistency in the government’s policies, such as reducing tax last year and increasing this year on electric vehicles, shows a lack of understanding of the matter. These are just a few examples of irrational and farfetched laws and policies of the past and incumbent governments. The politicians’ behaviours and self-righteous actions put a huge economic, social and environmental toll on the nation. Additionally, policies that lead to the depletion of natural resources and allocation of public property to private politicians’ cronies result from the irresponsibility of the leaders. Not to forget, the decisions of the former government led by KP Oli to allow the commercialisation and export of natural resources from the Chure region and swap the land of the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate are no less concerning. There should be stringent mechanisms to control politicians’ reckless decisions. Though the Supreme Court has been overturning such steps, self-fulfilling politicians like those in the current and past governments remain a nuisance. Politicians must be made responsible for their deeds, even if they do not trigger corruption cases. Publicising cost-benefit analysis before formulating any such policies and regulations should be made mandatory. Otherwise, no matter whether the old or the new leaders make it to the government with their chicaneries, Nepal will continue to bear economic, social and environmental costs.

In the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023-24, which began in mid-July, the country sent out 95.85 billion rupees in foreign education alone. The figure could be even higher, as students and their guardians often find non-conventional or illegal mediums, including hundi, to transfer money abroad. What is alarming is that the official figures represent a 42.5 percent increase from the same duration in the last fiscal year, when students took Rs67.19 billion to spend on education abroad. In FY 2022-23, the total outgoing amount stood at Rs142 billion, a 48 percent rise from the Rs67.70 billion in FY 2021-22.Along with cash, the number of Nepali youths leaving home for education abroad is growing each year. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, over 90,000 students have obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Education. The total figure for FY 2022-23 stood at over 110,000, while it was almost 113,000 in FY 2021-22. As per the Ministry of Education, the number of students obtaining NOC has tripled in the past decade. That these students start earning after a few years and send money is a positive fact not to be missed—Nepal’s remittance is growing every year, thanks to the students-turned-non-resident Nepalis and labour migrants. But what we gain from remittance, we end up losing in the form of human capital. At a median age of 27.1, we are still a relatively younger country, which makes us a lucrative source for the export of youths.Our youths are heading out of the country in hundreds of thousands each year, and the risk is that they might return to the country only when we have missed the train of development. It is no surprise that 33 percent of the NOCs are obtained for study in Japan, a country of old people with a median age of almost 50 years. Ageing or aged developed countries like Japan, the United States and Canada, among many others, need a constant supply of youth migrants willing to toil hard.

Kyiv and the West say Russia is waging an illegal war of conquest.World leaders including US Vice President Kamala Harris, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron gathered this weekend at a mountaintop resort in a bid to bolster international support for ending the war.Many Western leaders voiced forceful condemnation of the invasion, invoking the UN Charter in defense of Ukrainian territorial integrity, and rejecting Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands for parts of Ukraine as a condition for peace.“One thing is clear in this conflict: there is an aggressor, which is Putin, and there is a victim, which is the Ukrainian people,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.Some leaders are expected to depart early, and talks on Sunday will turn towards pursuing a joint position on the need for nuclear and food security, and the return of prisoners of war and children removed from Ukraine during the conflict.White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Qatar had helped to mediate the return from Russia of 30 or more Ukrainian children to their families.“It’s going to take international pressure.

This is the essence of this conference,” he said. “Peace and peace processes take time, working millimetre by millimetre.” ","summary":"Western powers and countries from the rest of the world will use the second day of a major summit in Switzerland on Sunday to pursue a consensus on condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and underscoring concerns about the war's human cost.A draft of the final summit declaration seen by Reuters refers to Russia's invasion as a “war”- a label Moscow rejects - and calls for Ukraine’s control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and its Azov Sea ports to be restored.Moscow casts what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine as part of a broader struggle with the West, which it says wants to bring Russia to its knees. Kyiv and the West say Russia is waging an illegal war of conquest.World leaders including US Vice President Kamala Harris, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron gathered this weekend at a mountaintop resort in a bid to bolster international support for ending the war.Many Western leaders voiced forceful condemnation of the invasion, invoking the UN Charter in defense of Ukrainian territorial integrity, and rejecting Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands for parts of Ukraine as a condition for peace.“One thing is clear in this conflict: there is an aggressor, which is Putin, and there is a victim, which is the Ukrainian people,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.Some leaders are expected to depart early, and talks on Sunday will turn towards pursuing a joint position on the need for nuclear and food security, and the return of prisoners of war and children removed from Ukraine during the conflict.White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Qatar had helped to mediate the return from Russia of 30 or more Ukrainian children to their families.“It’s going to take international pressure.

Nepal endured a violent Maoist insurgency from 1996, which ended after ten years with a comprehensive peace accord in 2006.Bhandari addressed the council as a representative of the Global Alliance of the Missing, advocating for families of missing and disappeared people across the world.“The world has not done enough to acknowledge the suffering of the families or to address their needs,” he said. “Families in Nepal are still waiting for answers 18 years after the end of the conflict.” This is the second time that an insurgency victim was allowed to speak before the UN Security Council, considered one of the most influential UN bodies. He said the families would like to remind states that they seek their continued support in mobilising the relevant authorities to find the “political will” and the needed resources so that families can find truth, answers, and justice. There is no sustainable peace without individual peace, he asserted. “We, families of missing people, would like to encourage states to adopt missing persons legislation and appropriate legal frameworks in all countries where missing persons are present,” he further said. Talking to the Post over the phone from New York, he said that addressing the UN Security Council was a great opportunity to remind the leadership from different countries, including Nepal, about the situation of conflict victims and these states’ obligation towards them. “Imagine surviving the horrors of a war, only for your father, mother, siblings or children to go missing. What happens to those who remain when a family member is lost, not to death or relocation but to an enforced disappearance or having gone missing? How do the people left behind cope with that tragedy and move on,” he said.Bhandari’s father, Tej Bahadur, a former teacher, was arrested from Besisahar, headquarters of Lamjung district, on December 31, 2001, during the state of emergency. He was detained by a joint team of security forces commanded by then Deputy Superintendent of Police Pitambar Adhikari, according to the complaint filed at the disappearance commission. Tej Bahadur was blindfolded, handcuffed, and tortured in the street before being taken into custody, and was never seen again. Like Bhandari, thousands of families of the victims of enforced disappearances and other human rights violations have continuously been fighting for justice for around two decades, but successive governments and political parties have paid little attention to justice delivery. Records at the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons show as many as 3,223 complaints of enforced disappearances implicating either security forces or the Maoists have been lodged at the commission. The commission has identified 2,494 cases falling under its jurisdiction for investigation. Similarly, 63,718 complaints have been registered with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Human rights defenders say a conflict victim demanding justice from the UN Security Council is a significant step. “Bhandari’s address will definitely build pressure to move the transitional justice process forward. His statement has been officially recorded,” Mohna Ansari, a former member of the National Human Rights Commission, told the Post. “It might not have immediate results, but Nepal might face questions at the UN forums like the Universal Periodic Review.”Nepal’s transitional justice process has been paralysed since July 2022, when the government decided to extend the terms of two commissions without retaining their chairpersons and members. Despite the government’s claim that the amendment bill to the Transitional Justice Act would be endorsed by October 2022, which would also open the door for recruiting new office bearers, there has been no progress in amending the Act.The major political parties, despite making several attempts, have been unable to find a meeting point on the bill though there has been some progress.After year-long discussions, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives has narrowed down the differences in the bill. However, the House panel had been struggling to decide whether to categorise arbitrary killings or all killings except those that occurred in clashes as serious violations of human rights. It had also been unable to decide what happens in case the victims of human rights violations refuse to reconcile and demand punishment for the perpetrators. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal administration, through the national budget presented on May 28, has decided to set up a one-billion-rupee peace fund to provide relief and compensation to the victims. The government also has also announced to expedite the transitional justice process in the upcoming fiscal year. However, the bill has not been discussed since the formation of the UML-Maoist coalition on March 4. It is not known when the parliamentary committee will start discussing the amendment bill. Om Prakash Mishra, former Supreme Court chief justice, leads the committee formed to recommend the names of the office bearers of two commissions, but without the Act being amended, it has not commenced its work.Also addressing the UN Security Council, Lok Bahadur Thapa, Nepal’s permanent resident to the UN, said the country is committed to delivering justice to the victims by adopting its own homegrown and nationally-led process. “We have two transitional commissions to investigate the complaints. Similarly, the parliament is working on the amendment to the transitional justice law as directed by the Supreme Court,” he said.

A 2007 Human Rights Watch report on the “untouchables” of India observed, “The only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid in South Africa.” The HRW has declared caste discrimination a form of “hidden apartheid”—an apt observation for Nepal as well.In the past years, caste hatred and exclusion have become more concealed yet pervasive in the Himalayan region; caste has also spread its tentacles in the global diaspora. Last month, Amnesty International criticised the government’s utter apathy and lack of accountability on the persistent plight of Dalits. The communist-populist alliance in government doesn’t seem to heed the call for change. This is clear from recently announced government policies, programmes and budgets for the fiscal year 2024-25. The authorities are bent on keeping caste hierarchy and untouchability sacred and solid. Budget for ‘Dalit skills’On March 21, 2022, attending a Dalit function in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that he was making a big announcement for the dignity and freedom of the “untouchables”. So much so that, he said, they would not forget it in over a century. He hasn’t made his supposedly phenomenal Dalit project explicit, but some Dalits still haven’t given up their hopes. Something came with this year’s budget for the Dalit community: Rs200 million to enhance Dalits’ traditional skills to create employment and promote their livelihood. This small yet seemingly significant budget has buoyed some Dalits. After all, as everybody says, something is better than nothing. However, I’m sceptical about the effectiveness of the Dalit-centred budget. Is it a big enough pot of money to significantly impact the target population? Most people would say “No”. Even some prominent Dalit NGO personalities close to the governing parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount. Equally, are Dalits the only beneficiaries of this new scheme? I don't think so. The details of the intended 200-million project haven’t been developed yet. But it seems many non-Dalits will also get the support, especially those close to the ruling parties and leaders. There are at least two reasons for my understanding. First is the very name of the entity the government plans to establish to use that money: A separate body called the “Dalit, Neglected and Oppressed Class Upliftment and Development Corporation.” The use of so many words is likely intended to involve the beneficiaries from different castes and social groups. My suspicion stems from the second fact: In today’s Nepal, traditional Dalit skills—such as goldsmithing, tailoring, woodworking, and shoemaking—are no longer exclusively practised by Dalits. Once commercialised, many castes including the apex groups, have started these trades. So, skill enhancement projects will probably not be offered only to Dalits. I am not suggesting Dalits should have exclusive rights over these essential skills. It is neither practical nor proper to make such a case. My point is that it is probably wrong to think that the budget is for the betterment of Dalits. Untouched untouchabilityI have a serious objection to the utter lack of sensitivity towards the problems of Dalits, mainly the persistent practice of untouchability (hidden apartheid) in government policies, programmes and the budget. There is no single statement in the policies that mentions untouchability, let alone try to address it. The same applies to the state and local authorities under the federal system. The biggest irony is found in the Karnali Province, where the Province Head, Tilak Pariyar, is a Dalit man with a long history of fighting against the state as part of the Maoist movement, with ending caste oppression as a primary goal. On May 23, he presented 84-point policies and programmes of the province. Study it in detail, and aside from lip service here and there, there is no serious concern about the situation of Dalits in Karnali who have been facing caste humiliation and violence like nowhere else in the country. Yet the authorities seem totally blind to the realities! Recommended policy objectives What should a responsible government do, both in Kathmandu and Karnali? First, the federal capital should become sensitive towards the plight of Dalits, who suffer tremendously due to popular beliefs and practices of ritual impurity. Then, the federal capital should design a national policy framework that could be followed by the lower authorities.On a Sunday press meet, Caste Watch Network (CWN), a newly launched Dalit campaign group, recommended two fundamental policy objectives for tackling the complex problem of untouchability.First, the state should introduce new laws and policies—sticks and carrots—to enforce the constitutional and legal provisions against untouchability. It could, for example, forge a policy of immediately suspending government officials guilty of excluding and humiliating Dalits. Elderly people who discriminate against Dalits could be deprived of their elderly pensions for two years or so. Any temple practising Dalit exclusion could be deprived of state support in the form of money and sacred offerings and sacrificial animals (yes, even the historical and famous temples like Gorakhkali and Manakamana do practise a form of social exclusion). The second important policy objective would be to reform the religion. Some people frown at my suggestions about initiating religious and cultural reform, which they think takes many decades, if not centuries.While we cannot easily rewrite casteist texts like Manusmriti and Parasaramriti, it is possible to achieve the reformation of some religious beliefs and practices over time. For that, the secular state should stand firm against religious dogma and formulate proper laws and implement them. If no religious and/or cultural reform were possible at all, we would still be burning our mothers and sisters and other women alive on the sati pyres. If reform weren’t possible, we wouldn’t see a section of Bahuns drinking alcohol and consuming pork, and, as alluded to earlier, engaging in tailoring, drumming, shoemaking and goldsmithing. Upper castes have deceived Dalits. They have forced religious and cultural transformations in areas that benefit them materially and in other ways. And they have been opposed to the reform of those areas of religious and cultural traditions that would ensure equal rights for Dalits. For example, a Bahun doesn’t become polluted by drinking and drumming; these transgressions do not anger his deities. But he thinks he and his family, lineage and other deities and spirits become polluted if a drummer enters his house. Religious-cultural reform is not as tough as it seems. Governments and authorities at all levels should introduce new laws and policies and spend large sums to change the spiritual, religious and cultural spheres. Without this, we cannot do away with untouchability. ","summary":"Nepal is a de facto caste-apartheid state. A 2007 Human Rights Watch report on the “untouchables” of India observed, “The only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid in South Africa.” The HRW has declared caste discrimination a form of “hidden apartheid”—an apt observation for Nepal as well.In the past years, caste hatred and exclusion have become more concealed yet pervasive in the Himalayan region; caste has also spread its tentacles in the global diaspora. Last month, Amnesty International criticised the government’s utter apathy and lack of accountability on the persistent plight of Dalits. The communist-populist alliance in government doesn’t seem to heed the call for change. This is clear from recently announced government policies, programmes and budgets for the fiscal year 2024-25. The authorities are bent on keeping caste hierarchy and untouchability sacred and solid. Budget for ‘Dalit skills’On March 21, 2022, attending a Dalit function in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that he was making a big announcement for the dignity and freedom of the “untouchables”. So much so that, he said, they would not forget it in over a century. He hasn’t made his supposedly phenomenal Dalit project explicit, but some Dalits still haven’t given up their hopes. Something came with this year’s budget for the Dalit community: Rs200 million to enhance Dalits’ traditional skills to create employment and promote their livelihood. This small yet seemingly significant budget has buoyed some Dalits. After all, as everybody says, something is better than nothing. However, I’m sceptical about the effectiveness of the Dalit-centred budget. Is it a big enough pot of money to significantly impact the target population? Most people would say “No”. Even some prominent Dalit NGO personalities close to the governing parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount. Equally, are Dalits the only beneficiaries of this new scheme? I don't think so. The details of the intended 200-million project haven’t been developed yet. But it seems many non-Dalits will also get the support, especially those close to the ruling parties and leaders. There are at least two reasons for my understanding. First is the very name of the entity the government plans to establish to use that money: A separate body called the “Dalit, Neglected and Oppressed Class Upliftment and Development Corporation.” The use of so many words is likely intended to involve the beneficiaries from different castes and social groups. My suspicion stems from the second fact: In today’s Nepal, traditional Dalit skills—such as goldsmithing, tailoring, woodworking, and shoemaking—are no longer exclusively practised by Dalits. Once commercialised, many castes including the apex groups, have started these trades. So, skill enhancement projects will probably not be offered only to Dalits. I am not suggesting Dalits should have exclusive rights over these essential skills. It is neither practical nor proper to make such a case. My point is that it is probably wrong to think that the budget is for the betterment of Dalits. Untouched untouchabilityI have a serious objection to the utter lack of sensitivity towards the problems of Dalits, mainly the persistent practice of untouchability (hidden apartheid) in government policies, programmes and the budget. There is no single statement in the policies that mentions untouchability, let alone try to address it. The same applies to the state and local authorities under the federal system. The biggest irony is found in the Karnali Province, where the Province Head, Tilak Pariyar, is a Dalit man with a long history of fighting against the state as part of the Maoist movement, with ending caste oppression as a primary goal. On May 23, he presented 84-point policies and programmes of the province.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak.

Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.“No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,” said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill. Some of its lawmakers like Radheshyam Adhikari had criticised it strongly in the Upper House. However, it wasn't objected to by the Congress while endorsing it.Experts say this is an example of how laws are passed in Nepal. The executive includes provisions that allow for policy corruption, and these are endorsed as lawmakers do not care to engage in a thorough study and deliberations over the bill.“Policy corruption at the executive level can be checked if the lawmakers are vigilant and lawmaking is transparent,” Khimlal Devkota, a former National Assembly member who has closely studied Nepal’s law-making process, told the Post.Policy decisions in Nepal have become rather controversial. Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House.Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. “The lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.“The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.”Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process. Talking to law students on Sunday, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri said the government was creating a Suggestion Bank to receive feedback on bills. “Such feedback and suggestions will be incorporated in the bills,” he said.

Why can’t we be honest about them? Especially moms. They’re the most romanticised of anyone.”One rarely comes across a book titled ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’. My first thought after stumbling onto this literary piece was what possibly could have been the author’s grudge towards her mother for naming the book with such an abrasive title. And quite fittingly, the title has made its mark by drawing attention from readers worldwide, making the book a New York Times bestseller. American writer, filmmaker, former actress, and singer Jennette McCurdy has created a stir in the literary scene with her debut book, ‘I’m glad my mom died’. The book’s main theme revolves around the complicated relationship between the author and her mother. The book also explores other themes such as abuse, child stardom and exploitation, eating disorders, grief and healing, and finally, resilience and survival. The memoir opens with the celebration of McCurdy’s sixth birthday when her mom presents her with a two-piece outfit surrounded by daisies. McCurdy throws on her best fake smile and exclaims it to be her favourite birthday gift ever. This particular event prods the readers to be cautious about the series of events that will unfold, hinting at the complex and often painful dynamics of her relationship with her mother that are to be revealed throughout the narrative.The general perception regarding abuse tends to focus primarily on physical violence overlooking other forms, such as emotional and psychological abuse. McCurdy, in her memoir, chronicles the continuum of emotional and psychological abuse she had to face throughout her childhood at the hands of her mother. Just like any other helicopter parent, McCurdy’s mother projects her unmet aspiration of becoming an actor to her daughter. She then continues to micromanage every aspect of McCurdy’s life, often pressuring her to achieve the dream that she once harboured. The authoritarian demeanour of the mother leaves McCurdy to develop OCD from a young age which she refers to as the “Holy Ghost”. Due to her age, she isn’t fully aware of how harmful the condition she was diagnosed with can be. Instead, she is thrilled to have conversations with the “Holy Ghost” where she says, “I can talk to the holy ghost whenever I want to, and he can talk to me, guiding me to do what is right, which is whatever he tells me to do. I am so lucky”. As the memoir continues, the readers find that the mother uses McCurdy’s fame to pay their bills, often flaunting her daughter’s success to maintain her unattained lifestyle. McCurdy’s struggle to make her mother understand her aspiration to become a writer instead of an actor is similar to the struggle of the character Farhan in the Bollywood hit ‘3 Idiots’, where, at last, the orthodox father finally lets his son pursue his interest of becoming a photographer. However, in McCurdy’s case, her mother is dismissive of her daughter’s ambition and instead tries to manipulate her daughter by saying, “Writer’s dress is frumpy and fat. I would never want your little actress’s peach butt to turn into a big, giant writer’s watermelon butt.”The emotional quandary of McCurdy’s is further complicated when her mother gets diagnosed with breast cancer. The mother’s manipulative behaviour leads her to make her children watch the video of her cancer diagnosis time and again until her children take it to blame themselves for the cause of their mother’s cancer. Ultimately, McCurdy considers it her job to save her mother from mortal sickness as cancer. She tries every rule in the book to get validation from her mother to the extent that she hides her preferred colour, purple, just because her mother prefers pink.The situation worsens when even after having reached the age of 16, the mother thinks it is a good idea to let her son and daughter shower in the same bathroom.Similarly, she puts McCurdy on a strict diet plan of calorie restriction. She is even made to read every diet-related book even before she gets her menstruation. The memoir is divided into two parts, i.e. before and after. ‘Before’ chronicles McCurdy’s experience with her abusive mother, whereas ‘After’ poignantly describes the harrowing effect of bulimia as a result of her mother’s years of abuse. The book also focuses on the ethical and developmental concerns of exposing a child to the limelight from a young age through McCurdy’s personal experience in the Hollywood industry. It also highlights the damage the entertainment industry can do to a child’s mental and emotional well-being.The book shines in its execution, particularly in addressing the question, “What does grief look like when you don’t share a great relationship with your loved one?” This question ties seamlessly into the title, as McCurdy struggles to recognise and cope with her emotions following her mother’s death. The universal practice of idolising one’s mother makes it difficult for her to acknowledge the abuse she endured during childhood—adding layers to her grief and healing process. Despite being a candid account of McCurdy’s experience with abuse, the nature of the memoir can resonate with Nepali readers. It mirrors the stark reality of Nepali households, where children often bear the burden of their parents’ unfulfilled dreams of securing a stable job. This restricts them from following their desire when it comes to careers. The memoir plays its part in demonstrating that fame is not everything; it is frequently nothing at all. It urges its readers to see the thin line that demarcates the life of an ordinary person and a celebrity. However, underneath the line lies a shared humanity that transcends fame and fortune, reminding us that our intrinsic value is not defined by external measures of success.The memoir should come with a trigger warning because its graphic narration of emotional abuse might make readers uncomfortable. This disrupted the linear flow of my reading experience, making it difficult to progress through the book. However, the author’s touch of sarcasm creates an engaging authorial voice. Destined to become an actor yet a natural when it comes to writing, McCurdy has set the train in motion through her candid yet moving writing. She accurately describes the mental state of her formative years, which skillfully captures the emotions she wishes to convey. The memoir ends on a hopeful note as McCurdy affirms, “Mom didn’t get better.

Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said.

He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said.

Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

Established in 1960, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing grants and zero- to low-interest loans for programmes that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions.Replenishing IDA’s resources will be a key topic of the meeting, which comes at the midpoint of a funding cycle concluding in December 2024—when donors commit to contributions for July 2025 to June 2028.The June 18 session kicks off four days of closed-door meetings to discuss IDA21’s proposed focus areas, assess the financing needs of countries supported by IDA, and consider financing scenarios.The overarching theme for IDA21 is ‘ending poverty on a livable planet: delivering impact with urgency and ambition’.To fulfil this, the IDA21 policy package will have five focus areas: people, planet, prosperity, infrastructure and digitalisation, supported by four lenses of gender, jobs, fragility, conflict and violence, and private investments. The current replenishment (IDA20) ends on June 30, 2025.The target, or a narrow range of scenarios, for the pledging session, is typically agreed upon at the fourth replenishment meeting in October. IDA21 resources will be available for commitments for a three-year period starting July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2028.IDA will continue to provide special support for countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence and utilise windows to provide additional resources specific to key thematic priorities, such as crisis response, addressing regional challenges, and providing blended finance for private sector investments in IDA countries, among others.“IDA is scaling up its market share significantly, also enabling co-financing and coordinating donor resources to maximise impact.

It faced almost every challenge that a country could face—conflict, earthquakes, Covid, climate crisis, floods, and many others.”“This confluence has put Nepal's development gains at risk. Yet Nepal is a very resilient country. And despite these challenges, it has achieved significant development progress,” he said.Shree Krishna Nepal, joint-secretary at the finance ministry, said that the World Bank Group’s first economic mission to Nepal was in 1963 to assess the country's developing prospects and challenges. The group approved its first credit in 1969 for a telecommunications project that continues to be transformative today.Since then, IDA has provided Nepal with $6 billion in credits and grants. Currently, the World Bank is supporting 24 projects worth $2.3 billion. The World Bank said IDA is also helping transform the lives of millions of Nepalis through investments in education, health, jobs and skills, connectivity and infrastructure, social protection, food security, and others.A robust IDA 21 replenishment will ensure that IDA countries continue to benefit from it and that IDA continues its decades-long track record of lifting millions of people out of poverty, providing quality education for children, ensuring access to health services, and creating jobs so that people in low-income countries can become self-sustainable and living, according to the multilateral funding agency.

It faced almost every challenge that a country could face—conflict, earthquakes, Covid, climate crisis, floods, and many others.”“This confluence has put Nepal's development gains at risk. Yet Nepal is a very resilient country. And despite these challenges, it has achieved significant development progress,” he said.Shree Krishna Nepal, joint-secretary at the finance ministry, said that the World Bank Group’s first economic mission to Nepal was in 1963 to assess the country's developing prospects and challenges. The group approved its first credit in 1969 for a telecommunications project that continues to be transformative today.Since then, IDA has provided Nepal with $6 billion in credits and grants. Currently, the World Bank is supporting 24 projects worth $2.3 billion. The World Bank said IDA is also helping transform the lives of millions of Nepalis through investments in education, health, jobs and skills, connectivity and infrastructure, social protection, food security, and others.A robust IDA 21 replenishment will ensure that IDA countries continue to benefit from it and that IDA continues its decades-long track record of lifting millions of people out of poverty, providing quality education for children, ensuring access to health services, and creating jobs so that people in low-income countries can become self-sustainable and living, according to the multilateral funding agency.

However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.

The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country.

It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” ","summary":"The 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures.

It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

We have to bounce back quickly because there was lots wrong here and it’s a quick turnaround now.”Scotland, who did not have one effort on or off target, pulled a goal back late on when Ruediger inadvertently headed the ball into his own net but substitute Emre Can then curled home a fine shot in stoppage time for the Germans’ fifth goal.The reeling Scots next play the Swiss on Wednesday.

And the output against Yemen could possibly convince ANFA to trigger another extension in his contract. ANFA had added a three-month extension in Annese’s contract this year.The emergence of Sanjeeb, who only made his international debut in March this year as an 88th minute substitute during a 5-0 qualifiers loss to Bahrain, is even more promising.Sanjeeb, who played full 90 minutes in Nepal’s 3-0 loss against Bahrain before being benched in 4-0 defeat to the UAE, had a hand in both of Nepal’s goals against Yemen in Dammam.Sanjeeb, who replaced star forward Anjan Bista in the front, first pounced on a misplaced back pass from Radhawan Al Hubaishi and bent the ball past Yemen goalkeeper Mohammed Khairalah to score an equaliser in the 22nd minute.Sanjeeb then received a long pass from Chhiring Lama and served it for Karki to head home Nepal’s second goal in the 66th.It was the first international goals for both Sanjeeb and Karki. Karki made his debut for Nepal in September last year during Nepal’s goalless draw with Myanmar. The evening was also memorable for Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Playing his 100th international match, the 34-year-old goalkeeper produced a string of stunning saves to keep Yemen at bay till the final moments and helped Nepal earn a point.Even though Nepal failed to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and could not directly qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup, they still have a chance to secure their spot in their maiden Asian Cup through Asian Cup Qualification which will be played between March 25, 2025 to March 31, 2026.Top two teams from each nine groups qualified for the third round of 2026 FIFA World Cup and also secured a direct berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.

The war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas has also diverted the world's attention from Ukraine.The talks will focus on broader concerns triggered by the war, such as food and nuclear security.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has trumpeted the summit's wide attendance as a success and predicted \"history being made\", adding that agreements stemming from it will be part of the peacemaking process.\"Ukraine never wanted this war. It's a criminal and absolutely unprovoked aggression by Russia,\" he said alongside Swiss President Viola Amherd, who said the conflict had brought \"unimaginable suffering\" and violated international law.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the gathering an important step to discuss peace and security questions.\"This is a small plant that needs to be watered, but of course also with the perspective that more can then come out of it,\" he told Welt TV.Biden sent US Vice President Kamala Harris to represent him—riling Kyiv—while Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be represented by his foreign minister and India dispatched a lower-level delegation. Beijing is staying away after Russia was frozen out of proceedings.Harris announced more than $1.5 billion in energy and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, where infrastructure has been pounded by Russian airstrikes since the 2022 invasion.\"This war remains an utter failure for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\" Harris said during a meeting with Zelenskiy.A military helicopter hovered over the luxury Buergenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne on Saturday as leaders arrived by helicopter on a patch of grassland fenced off with razor wire while cows grazed nearby.On the eve of the summit, Putin said Russia would end the war only if Kyiv agreed to drop its NATO ambitions and hand over four provinces claimed by Moscow—demands Kyiv swiftly rejected as tantamount to surrender.Putin's conditions apparently reflected Moscow's growing confidence that its forces have the upper hand in the war. Scholz cast them as an attempt to muddy the waters.\"Everyone knows that this is not a serious proposal, but had something to do with the peace conference in Switzerland,\" he said in a separate TV interview.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Putin's proposal had \"shown the real path to peace\".\"If you want to save the world, discuss Vladimir Putin's proposal ... Only those who do not want peace can't see, can't understand it,\" TASS news agency quoted her as saying.China and RussiaZelenskiy has accused Beijing of helping Moscow undermine the gathering, an accusation China's Foreign Ministry denied.The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada and Japan are among those due to attend. Turkey and Hungary, which maintain friendlier ties with Russia, are also expected to join.Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said it was an opportunity to start building a broader global consensus to put pressure on Russia.\"It's like we're in a Western echo chamber.

The war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas has also diverted the world's attention from Ukraine.The talks will focus on broader concerns triggered by the war, such as food and nuclear security.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has trumpeted the summit's wide attendance as a success and predicted \"history being made\", adding that agreements stemming from it will be part of the peacemaking process.\"Ukraine never wanted this war. It's a criminal and absolutely unprovoked aggression by Russia,\" he said alongside Swiss President Viola Amherd, who said the conflict had brought \"unimaginable suffering\" and violated international law.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the gathering an important step to discuss peace and security questions.\"This is a small plant that needs to be watered, but of course also with the perspective that more can then come out of it,\" he told Welt TV.Biden sent US Vice President Kamala Harris to represent him—riling Kyiv—while Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be represented by his foreign minister and India dispatched a lower-level delegation. Beijing is staying away after Russia was frozen out of proceedings.Harris announced more than $1.5 billion in energy and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, where infrastructure has been pounded by Russian airstrikes since the 2022 invasion.\"This war remains an utter failure for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\" Harris said during a meeting with Zelenskiy.A military helicopter hovered over the luxury Buergenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne on Saturday as leaders arrived by helicopter on a patch of grassland fenced off with razor wire while cows grazed nearby.On the eve of the summit, Putin said Russia would end the war only if Kyiv agreed to drop its NATO ambitions and hand over four provinces claimed by Moscow—demands Kyiv swiftly rejected as tantamount to surrender.Putin's conditions apparently reflected Moscow's growing confidence that its forces have the upper hand in the war. Scholz cast them as an attempt to muddy the waters.\"Everyone knows that this is not a serious proposal, but had something to do with the peace conference in Switzerland,\" he said in a separate TV interview.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Putin's proposal had \"shown the real path to peace\".\"If you want to save the world, discuss Vladimir Putin's proposal ... Only those who do not want peace can't see, can't understand it,\" TASS news agency quoted her as saying.China and RussiaZelenskiy has accused Beijing of helping Moscow undermine the gathering, an accusation China's Foreign Ministry denied.The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada and Japan are among those due to attend. Turkey and Hungary, which maintain friendlier ties with Russia, are also expected to join.Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said it was an opportunity to start building a broader global consensus to put pressure on Russia.\"It's like we're in a Western echo chamber. That is: all Western European countries, the USA, we agree on what we want to happen with Ukraine,\" Nehammer said. \"But that alone is not enough.\"Neutral Switzerland, which took on the summit at Zelenskiy's behest, wants to pave the way for a future peace process that includes Russia.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.

During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  ","summary":"Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire.

The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition.

Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   ","summary":"United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles.

You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments.

The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe.

As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved?

Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   "},{"hash":"f473cb1219e16f1ca74d5e86b989f2d382bcbc5295cf57206ba377409f6f3514","title":"today-s-weather-june-16-2024","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/weather/2024/06/16/today-s-weather-june-16-2024","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb9-1718505019.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718496000000,"source":"kp","category":"weather","content":"The weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country on Sunday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of Gandaki, Koshi and Bagmati provinces the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.
