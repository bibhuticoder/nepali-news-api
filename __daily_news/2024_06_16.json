This was the first time the two teams were ever playing. After winning the toss, Captain Rohit Paudel invited South Africa to bat first. Proving their captain's decision right, the Nepali bowlers restricted South Africa to 115 runs for 7 wickets in 20 overs.\n  In restricting the opponents to a partly total, Kushal Bhurtel took 4 wickets giving away just 19 runs in his quota of 4 overs.

Tristan Stubbs scored 27 runs in 18 balls while other batsmen failed to make any significant impact.\nNepal's chase got to a good start with both the openers seeing through the power play, without giving away their wicket and scoring 32 runs in 6 overs. However, with the introduction of spin, Nepal lost ground and lost two wickets while scoring 16 runs in the next four overs. Nepal were 48/2 at the half hour mark i.e. 10 overs.\nNepal lost opener Kushal Bhurtel who scored 13 runs in 21 balls, including a four and a six. Captain Rohit Paudel was out duck facing 2 balls. Both fell at the same over, bowled by Tabraiz Shamsim, whose 4 overs costing Nepal 4 wickets proved the difference. After applying the brakes in the 7th over with 2 wickets, Shamsim came back to haunt Nepal by taking another 2 wickets in a single over in the 17th over. Dipendra Singh Airee 6 (11) was caught behind while the set batsman Aasif Sheikh 42 (49) was clean bowled by Shamshim, who was later adjudged the player-of-the-match.\nWith 12 runs needed in the last two overs, the experienced Kushal Malla fell to Anrich Nortje scoring only 1 run in 3 overs. It was now left to new batsman Gulshan Jha and Sompal Kami, only player to have played the previous T20 World Cup when Nepal had last qualified in 2014.\nSompal Kami scored a huge six in the 18th over, bringing down the equation to 8 runs in the last six balls. New batsman Jha was on the crease to face the final over bowled by Ottneil Baartman. The first two balls he failed to put bat on ball, but scored the third ball for a four. He then scored two runs in the fourth ball, leaving only two runs to get from the last two balls. However, he failed to put bat on ball and was run out trying to steal a run to take the match to super over.\nIt was in similar circumstances that Nepal was out of the previous T20 World Cup it qualified in 2014. Nepal defeated fellow associates Hong Kong and Afghanistan but suffered a loss to the host, Bangladesh. Despite the two wins, Nepal couldn’t advance to the next round due to a lower net run rate. Hence, Nepal has been proved second time unlucky, going out after putting up a good display against a test side.\nIt was a must win match for Nepal today to have any chance of making it to the last eight.

Nepal was defeated by the Netherlands in the first match by 6 wickets while the second match against Sri Lanka was washed out. Nepal will now only play for pride against Bangladesh on Monday.

As the first South Asian to climb all 14 mountains above 8,000 meters, Mingma's unparalleled mastery of high-altitude logistics, climbing strategy, and profound understanding of mountains is second to none.\nA New Era in Nepali Mountaineering\nThis historic ascent not only marks a significant milestone in the mountaineering world but also opens up new opportunities for climbers from Nepal as well as around the globe aspiring to climb from the Nepalese side.

Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.”Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them.“Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.”Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!”“Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group.

Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group.

The report said this highlights the challenge of finding jobs for youths in Nepal. The survey report shows joblessness among people between the ages of 15 and 24 declined to 22.7 percent in 2022-23 from 23.9 percent in 2017-18.“Most worrying is the rise in unemployment in the past five years, which increased by 1.2 percent, and that’s worrisome,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the statistics office. “The economy has failed to generate enough jobs for its large and expanding young population.”The population structure has shifted towards a younger working-age population, with a decrease in the proportion of children (0-14 years) and an increase in the proportion of adults (15-59 years).This trend is further supported by a declining dependency ratio, suggesting a growing workforce. The proportion of the elderly population (60 years and above) has increased.Regmi said the age between 15 and 24, the most productive time for an individual, is not considered the working age in Nepal, as these people are involved in education and training.“At this age, our survey has found, people will work only if they are offered a job. The responsibility to earn money grows in later years.”The survey data on employment status reveals significant shifts in the labour market between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of those with jobs has declined considerably from 67.2 percent in 1995-96 to 32.4 percent in 2022-23, while the percentage of those not in the labour force has increased from 29.4 percent to 62.9 percent.The share of wage employment in agriculture has significantly declined from 70.7 percent in 1995-96 to 1.9 percent in 2022-23. The share of wage employment in non-agriculture, on the other hand, has risen considerably from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 56.6 percent in 2022-23.The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed.The labour force participation rate came down to 37.1 percent in 2022-23 from 38.2 percent five years ago.“The employment condition in Nepal is the worst,” said economist Pushkar Bajracharya. “The government failed to create jobs. This is because the investment environment has not been favourable in past years, mainly due to political and policy uncertainty. When there is no investment, there is no job creation.”Bajracharya said the unemployment rate would further jump due to the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the recession and slowdown the country has seen.“Many industries, service sectors and companies are still laying off workers due to the economic slowdown. There is low demand for labour in the country as the key economic sectors—construction and manufacturing—are facing recession, while wholesale and retail have shown a slight recovery,” said Bajracharya. Experts say that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the jobs being created in Nepal’s economy are not of quality. There is a need for new strategies, new partners, and new goals.Each year, around a million Nepali youths, including students, leave the country to try their luck abroad.The survey data on remittances and transfers reveals a significant increase in the prevalence and magnitude of remittances received by households in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23.The percentage of households receiving remittances has increased dramatically from 23.4 percent in 1995-96 to 76.8 percent in 2022-23, indicating a significant rise in the number of Nepali families relying on the money sent by their members working abroad.This increase is consistent with the observed growth in average remittances per household, which has significantly increased from Rs15,160 in 1995-96 to Rs145,093 in 2022-23.Remittances (other than from India) are quite dominant, highlighting the importance of international migration for income generation.Remittances from India declined from 32.9 percent in 1995-96 to 11.1 percent in 2010-11, but they have increased since, reaching 21.3 percent in 2022-23, according to the survey report.The survey data on household loans shows that the percentage of families borrowing money is relatively stable (61.3 percent in 1995-96 and 63.8 percent in 2022-23). However, the percentage of households with outstanding loans has significantly increased, from 58.4 percent in 1995-96 to 97.3 percent in 2022-23.The data also reveals a shift in the sources of household loans. Traditional money lenders were previously a dominant source (39.7 percent in 1995-96), but their share significantly decreased to 11.4 percent in 2022-23.The share of loans from banks has increased (from 16.1 percent in 1995-96 to 22.4 percent in 2022-23), while loans from relatives continue to remain significant (40.8 percent in 1995-96 to 42.5 percent in 2022-23).Household consumption as a reason for borrowing has been declining (from 49.4 percent in 1995-96 to 23.5 percent in 2022-23). This could be attributed to improved access to essential goods and services or a shift to other borrowing needs, the survey report shows.The use of collateral has also shifted, with an increase in the proportion of loans taken with collateral. While 16.8 percent of loans were taken with land and house collateral in 1995-96, this share increased to 35.1 percent in 2022-23.The data shows a noticeable shift in the dominant sectors of non-farm activities. While trade was previously the most prevalent sector (52.1 percent in 1995-96), it has declined (42.5 percent in 2022-23). The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23.Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support.Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72.Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent.According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23.Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867.The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income.The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23.The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population.This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23.The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23.This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23.The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases.There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices. A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices.Cold/fever remains a significant concern, increasing from 43.7 percent in 1995-96 to 51.5 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of those consulting a doctor has remained relatively stable (around 29 percent), and the percentage consulting a paramedic has significantly decreased.Migration patterns within Nepal reveal significant shifts in trends between 2003-04 and 2022-23. While the overall percentage of the migrant population within the country has remained relatively stable—36.6 percent in 2003-04 and 38.1 percent in 2022-23—there is a notable shift in the gender composition of migrants.Males constituted a higher proportion of migrants in 2003-04 (50.1 percent), but females made a larger share of the migrant population (49.6 percent) in 2022-23. A decline in the percentage of migrants from rural areas in 2022-23 indicates a potential shift in migration patterns, possibly driven by changing economic opportunities and societal factors.The analysis of reasons for migration reveals that family remains the dominant factor (75.2 percent in 2003-04 moving within the country for family reasons and 74.9 percent in 2022-23).The fourth Nepal Living Standards Survey, conducted in 2022-23, is the first such survey since the country’s transition to a federal system. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 9,600 households on a wide range of topics.

Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government?Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government.Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises.Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet.After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently.“We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post.Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam.“The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.”After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls.During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said.“However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.”Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K.The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television.“Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.”But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.” ","summary":"What’s cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party?

Our future”. The theme for this year’s World Environment Day, emphasising land restoration, combating desertification and building resilience to drought, encompasses the pressing issues of this era which need careful intervention. The scale and intensity of the impacts of land degradation, desertification and drought are alarming. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) states that up to 40 percent of the world’s land is degraded, adversely impacting around 3.2 billion people. Projections also indicate that over three-quarters of the world's population by 2050 will be affected by drought. These impacts manifest in several aspects of life and nature, including loss of biodiversity and ecosystems, depletion of resources, food insecurity, livelihood and ultimate human existence. In recent times, land degradation induced by physical, chemical and biological processes has been accelerated by human activities. The main culprits include haphazard infrastructure development, industrialisation, high carbon-intensive energy use, overgrazing and excessive extraction of natural resources without consideration of environmental sustainability. Prolonged droughts are becoming more common and climate change adds uncertainty and complexities to their occurrences. Nepal’s vulnerabilityNepal’s young mountains are geologically fragile and complex. Located in a tectonically active zone, the whole land mass from the Himalayas in the North to the Siwalik in the South is susceptible to peculiar challenges, especially erosion, landslides and floods. Anthropogenic activities in this hazard-prone region, including haphazard infrastructure construction, land use change, and chemical fertiliser and pesticide overuse, exacerbate these natural phenomena. For instance, road construction on the slopes without due consideration to the environment and slope stabilisation in the last decade has increased incidents of landslides and slope failures. Excessive extraction of resources from rivers is another concern. While regulatory provisions in the Environment Protection Act and Regulation mandate comprehensive assessment, project developers often perceive such provisions as a burden. Limited focus on the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan, compliance monitoring and evaluation, and audits are the reasons behind haphazard resource extraction and the continuation of environmentally unsustainable projects.Soil loss through erosion, a serious threat to soil health, results in agricultural yield decline, ecosystem degradation, habitat destruction and several economic impacts. A 2016 study by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) estimated 40 million tons of soil loss between 1990 and 2010 in the Koshi basin. Identification of arable soil loss areas is critical for effective land management planning focused on conservation measures. The 61st report of the Office of the Auditor General pointed out that the content of soil organic matter currently stands at 2.83 against the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 3.37. Policy interventionsA 2018 report titled “Land degradation neutrality target setting program in Nepal” set three targets to be achieved by 2030: i) Increase forest cover to 44.7 percent; ii) increase agricultural growth by 6 percent; iii) increase Soil Organic Carbon in forest and cropland by 1 percent per annum and iv) restoring 10 percent of wetland ecosystem out of 26277 sq. hectares of wetlands. Among these, Nepal’s success in increasing forest cover from 39.6 percent in 1993 to 44.74 percent in 2018 is praised all over the world as one of the best-case examples of sustainable forest management initiatives. Despite this achievement, the recent episodes of forest fires during the pre-monsoon period are worrisome. The attainment of other targets requires concentrated effort by building synergies and collaboration among national policies/strategies and different climate action programmes. For instance, Land Use Policy, Agriculture Development Strategy, Nepal Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and Climate Change Policy are required to be aligned on its objectives, strategies and programmes. At the programme level, for instance, the National Climate Change Support Programme, the National Adaptation Plan, and the President Chure Terai Madesh Conservation Programme need to focus on a collaborative approach; eliminating duplication and creating synergies among beneficiaries and outcome of this programme. Research on drought shows an increasing trend in both the intensity and frequency of drought occurrences. The impacts of drought are significantly higher in rain-fed agricultural regions like Nepal, which rely extensively on the monsoon. Droughts result in crop failures and food insecurity, which is why region-specific explorations of droughts are essential for effective drought monitoring and risk mitigation. A 2021 study indicated that summer drought events have increased fivefold in the central region, doubled in the eastern region, and not significantly changed in the western region of Nepal. These incidences have severe implications for vulnerable communities that are mostly dependent on subsentence agriculture for their livelihood. As a result, difficulty in local livelihoods prevails, which acts as a “push factor” leading to increased migration from rural to urban city centres and abroad. Soil healthHealthy soil is the foundation not only of agricultural systems and food security but also of the existence of humans. So, data management should be a priority towards understanding and analysing the pattern, trend and hotspots of land degradation and droughts. Sustainable land management programmes should incorporate soil conservation and watershed management, soil fertility management and improvement, community forestry programmes, technology development, and research and development. Climate-smart agriculture and the implementation and monitoring of environmental management plans are equally important. For these programmes to be successful, functional coordination mechanisms and institutional arrangements are pivotal. Further, opportunities to tap climate finance for implementing adaptation programmes at the local level will be crucial.

The persistent gender disparities across various spheres of life—education, employment, healthcare, and beyond—are stark reminders of the structural barriers confronting women in Pakistan. Despite efforts, the nation consistently lags on gender parity indices, raising concerns about the adequacy and sufficiency of initiatives targeted at closing the gender gap. Placed 142nd out of 146 countries on the WEF’s 2023 Global Gender Gap Index, it is evident that significant strides are needed to address gender inequities in Pakistan.An examination of past budgetary allocations and policy documents unveils a persistent neglect of gender considerations, manifesting in inadequate resource allocation for women across crucial sectors. These systemic imbalances perpetuate gender inequalities, thwarting the full realisation of Pakistan’s human potential. Recent stabilisation policies have further tilted the scales against women due to discriminate access to formal capital markets, decent jobs, financial and digital tools, etc.As the new fiscal year approaches, it is imperative to remind the government of the gender issues that have only received perfunctory attention over the years. Policymakers must acknowledge that no economic recovery can be sustainable if half the country’s population is inhibited in its capacity to contribute productively, underscoring the need for gender-centric policies.While economic revival must remain a top priority, any effort towards this goal without adequate female representation is like building a house of cards. Sustainable economic recovery is contingent upon the mainstreaming of gender-centric policies across all sectors. This necessitates integrating the gendered impacts of policies into the planning process, rather than treating them as an afterthought.In this context, the federal and provincial budgets can be leveraged by respective governments to address disparities through gender-responsive budgeting. Gender Responsive Budget entails evaluating the gendered impacts of budgetary allocations, integrating gender equality in planning processes, and establishing monitoring mechanisms for greater accountability. The overarching goal is to ensure equitable distribution of resources for inclusive development.It is disconcerting that despite the widespread adoption of Gender Responsive Budget in many countries, including South Asian counterparts India and Bangladesh, Pakistan has yet to present a gender-responsive budget. As a first step, all PC-1 forms must incorporate a dedicated section obligating departments to thoroughly assess the gendered impacts of the proposed projects. Projects that help level the playing field should be prioritised over those that magnify distortions. Additionally, macroeconomic policies must only be implemented after carefully assessing their differential impacts on women.To further promote gender equity, several key demands must be addressed, including ensuring equal employment opportunities, pay equity, supporting women-owned businesses with financial incentives, and increasing funding for girls’ education, especially in underserved areas. Expanding maternal, reproductive, and mental health services, establishing affordable childcare facilities, and streng­thening laws and support services against gender-based violence are also essential, particularly in the face of climatic cha­l­lenges. Ad­­diti­o­­nally, enhancing social protection program­mes for more coverage, along with increasing digital and financial access is essential to promote equity.Greater representation of women in decision-making roles is of utmost import­ance. Currently, political representation seems confined to a few privileged women, often detached from the everyday challenges faced by the majority.This lack of representative female voices in the political arena results in the formation of ineffective policies that overlook critical gender issues. Developing mechanisms to facilitate participatory budgeting can help address this concern.The government must also prioritise data consolidation to support evidence-based policymaking. At present, the inadequate targeting of social programmes stemming from deficiencies in data undermines the effectiveness of initiatives. With limited fiscal space, the government must calibrate each and every budgetary allocation judiciously for maximised impact, for which data is key.In a nutshell, mainstreaming gender considerations across all sectors during the planning phase can enable policy-makers to significantly enhance the prospects for fairer, more inclusive economic resurgence.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN ","summary":"Even in 2024, women stand a long way from accessing equal opportunities with men.

Gender Responsive Budget entails evaluating the gendered impacts of budgetary allocations, integrating gender equality in planning processes, and establishing monitoring mechanisms for greater accountability. The overarching goal is to ensure equitable distribution of resources for inclusive development.It is disconcerting that despite the widespread adoption of Gender Responsive Budget in many countries, including South Asian counterparts India and Bangladesh, Pakistan has yet to present a gender-responsive budget. As a first step, all PC-1 forms must incorporate a dedicated section obligating departments to thoroughly assess the gendered impacts of the proposed projects. Projects that help level the playing field should be prioritised over those that magnify distortions. Additionally, macroeconomic policies must only be implemented after carefully assessing their differential impacts on women.To further promote gender equity, several key demands must be addressed, including ensuring equal employment opportunities, pay equity, supporting women-owned businesses with financial incentives, and increasing funding for girls’ education, especially in underserved areas. Expanding maternal, reproductive, and mental health services, establishing affordable childcare facilities, and streng­thening laws and support services against gender-based violence are also essential, particularly in the face of climatic cha­l­lenges. Ad­­diti­o­­nally, enhancing social protection program­mes for more coverage, along with increasing digital and financial access is essential to promote equity.Greater representation of women in decision-making roles is of utmost import­ance. Currently, political representation seems confined to a few privileged women, often detached from the everyday challenges faced by the majority.This lack of representative female voices in the political arena results in the formation of ineffective policies that overlook critical gender issues. Developing mechanisms to facilitate participatory budgeting can help address this concern.The government must also prioritise data consolidation to support evidence-based policymaking. At present, the inadequate targeting of social programmes stemming from deficiencies in data undermines the effectiveness of initiatives. With limited fiscal space, the government must calibrate each and every budgetary allocation judiciously for maximised impact, for which data is key.In a nutshell, mainstreaming gender considerations across all sectors during the planning phase can enable policy-makers to significantly enhance the prospects for fairer, more inclusive economic resurgence.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN "},{"hash":"21884594fa226b4b5ae488c76cdfce5ab938bdb79bdcd3c1ea9a1b26539d5766","title":"the-costs-of-leaders-irrational-decisions","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/14/the-costs-of-leaders-irrational-decisions","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/downthumb1-1718373614.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718323200000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Nepal is in the hands of shortsighted and irrational decision-makers. Take, for example, the recent directive by Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to deploy traffic rule violators for traffic management. Thankfully, Lamichhane’s directive was overturned by the Supreme Court. The Kathmandu Road Division’s hasty decision to blacktop the road section the Kathmandu Metropolitan City had prepared for footpath extension is another example.It is striking how Lamichhane—a journalist-turned-politician and a former vocal critic of the ministers from parties he now aligns with—turned out no different. He is just as unscrupulous and power-hungry as the old guard, doing everything he can to remain in power and satisfy his political ambitions. Such a hunger for power leads him to make hasty and moody decisions, further augmenting the burden on the economy and society. This piece will analyse the economic cost of such decisions later, but first, let’s understand the reasons behind the pomposity of the leaders. One must understand political schooling to understand why Nepali politicians, new and old, formulate bizarre policies. What are the qualifications to become a politician, let alone a minister, in Nepal? It is anything but education and expertise. The current federal Cabinet of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and state and local level governments are not far from any of this. Most of them are no experts, nor do they hold the required knowledge to run their positions. The irony is that we have a government where a journalist becomes the home minister, a former rebel commander becomes the finance minister, and someone who lost the election becomes the minister of foreign affairs, home affairs, and physical infrastructure and transportation, all within a year under the same prime ministership. How can one person seamlessly transition between ministries overnight and suddenly become an expert in each field? ConsequencesThe lack of proper education and thorough understanding of the policymakers’ responsibilities is causing serious problems at the policy level. This is the main reason for their narrow-mindedness—their inability to accept diversity and expert opinions—and to understand complex social and economic phenomena, which leads them to have a “holier-than-thou” and “I am the law” attitude. Huge economic costs and unnecessary social burdens come with that. Every economic policy comes with economic and social costs. Economic costs are of two types: Direct costs and opportunity costs. Direct costs are the actual tangible expenditures associated with implementing a policy and can be easily measured. Opportunity costs are implicit and come with forgone policy alternatives. These are difficult to measure, yet are crucial for policy evaluation, as they directly affect overall output or the economy. For example, had the home minister's recent ruling not been halted by the Supreme Court, it would have cost the nation an estimated Rs250 million a year. This calculation is based on the daily productivity of an individual ($1434/365) at the current exchange rate (Rs133.25/USD) and 1,300 incidences per day. The recent impulsive decision by the Road Department, under Raghuvir Mahaseth, to blacktop a section of the New Road, led to financial costs. If the minister were concerned about the people and the economy, he would have worked to speed up the construction of the remaining section of the Ring Road, which has far more important economic, social, and health and environmental concerns. As a result of these difficulties, households are bearing extra social costs, and the retail and service economies are losing productivity in the area due to a lack of proper infrastructure and environmental quality. Further, this will only increase the cost of production over time and reduce the country’s output because of fewer economic activities. Similarly, the former finance minister Janardan Sharma’s controversial tax policy and the current finance minister Barsha Man Pun's ineffective policy of distributing the budget for their cadres through popular programmes such as the Prime Minister Daughter Resilient Programme—when similar programmes like former PM KP Oli’s Prime Minister Employment Programme turned into white elephants—will add further burden. The inconsistency in the government’s policies, such as reducing tax last year and increasing this year on electric vehicles, shows a lack of understanding of the matter. These are just a few examples of irrational and farfetched laws and policies of the past and incumbent governments. The politicians’ behaviours and self-righteous actions put a huge economic, social and environmental toll on the nation. Additionally, policies that lead to the depletion of natural resources and allocation of public property to private politicians’ cronies result from the irresponsibility of the leaders. Not to forget, the decisions of the former government led by KP Oli to allow the commercialisation and export of natural resources from the Chure region and swap the land of the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate are no less concerning. There should be stringent mechanisms to control politicians’ reckless decisions. Though the Supreme Court has been overturning such steps, self-fulfilling politicians like those in the current and past governments remain a nuisance. Politicians must be made responsible for their deeds, even if they do not trigger corruption cases. Publicising cost-benefit analysis before formulating any such policies and regulations should be made mandatory. Otherwise, no matter whether the old or the new leaders make it to the government with their chicaneries, Nepal will continue to bear economic, social and environmental costs.

In the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023-24, which began in mid-July, the country sent out 95.85 billion rupees in foreign education alone. The figure could be even higher, as students and their guardians often find non-conventional or illegal mediums, including hundi, to transfer money abroad. What is alarming is that the official figures represent a 42.5 percent increase from the same duration in the last fiscal year, when students took Rs67.19 billion to spend on education abroad. In FY 2022-23, the total outgoing amount stood at Rs142 billion, a 48 percent rise from the Rs67.70 billion in FY 2021-22.Along with cash, the number of Nepali youths leaving home for education abroad is growing each year. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, over 90,000 students have obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Education. The total figure for FY 2022-23 stood at over 110,000, while it was almost 113,000 in FY 2021-22. As per the Ministry of Education, the number of students obtaining NOC has tripled in the past decade. That these students start earning after a few years and send money is a positive fact not to be missed—Nepal’s remittance is growing every year, thanks to the students-turned-non-resident Nepalis and labour migrants. But what we gain from remittance, we end up losing in the form of human capital. At a median age of 27.1, we are still a relatively younger country, which makes us a lucrative source for the export of youths.Our youths are heading out of the country in hundreds of thousands each year, and the risk is that they might return to the country only when we have missed the train of development. It is no surprise that 33 percent of the NOCs are obtained for study in Japan, a country of old people with a median age of almost 50 years. Ageing or aged developed countries like Japan, the United States and Canada, among many others, need a constant supply of youth migrants willing to toil hard. Poor countries of Asia and Africa have become rich sources for the export of cheap labour that not only sustains the economies of developed countries but also supplies children who transform from immigrants to naturalised citizens and keep those countries in rude demographic health.Meanwhile, those in positions of power in Nepal, including political leaders, bureaucrats and university and school authorities, continue to turn the country into an undesirable place. As education becomes expensive and the job market is saturated, youths see no reason to stay back in Nepal. While education abroad is no guarantee of success, we have collectively failed to assure students of the quality of education we are offering at home. Apart from improving the quality itself, we also need to work on image-building—that Nepal’s education is not as bad as it has been made out to be.    ","summary":"In what looks like a perfect example of a circle of financial gain and loss, Nepal is sending a significant amount of money, much of which is earned through remittance, to foreign destinations every year to pay for the higher education of Nepalis.

This exhibition features stunning, inventive, and evocative artworks that explore a wide range of subjects and emotions. The artworks represent a diverse group of young artists from various parts of Nepal.Harshita Singh’s artwork is the first thing you see as you enter the space.

This intricate mixed-media features layers of symbolism that will engage art enthusiasts and amateurs alike. With a specific focus on Kathmandu, these works explore the essence of urban life and the difficulties faced by cities, employing materials like plastic sacks, glass, intricate paintwork, and calligraphy.These artworks address Kathmandu’s waste management issues and water scarcity with sensitivity and insight. They also shed light on Nepal’s brain drain problem, highlighting its impact on the city and its inhabitants.

More feathers scattered all over the floor, each one intricately painted with bird art. I found the concept to be both captivating and innovative, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression with daring experimentation. This artwork is part of Ronisha Shrestha’s series ‘Abandoned Companions’, in which she compassionately portrays the fate of animals in urban landscapes with incredible empathy.Saran Tandukar’s ‘Scarecrow’ stands out from the rest of the artworks presented in the space. He has collected clothes and fabrics from his community to capture stories, memories, and their essence.His work reflects the migration struggles in our community. He says, “When there is a drought, everybody leaves their home and field, even if they are emotionally connected. The situation forces them to leave everything behind.”He expresses feeling like an abandoned scarecrow in a drought-stricken field, watching his friends and family depart. Just as no one takes a scarecrow when they migrate, he feels as if he is left behind—a sentiment shared by many families and communities in Nepal.The artist’s expertise in working with cloth, particularly in capturing human features, adds an intriguing layer to the piece.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak.

Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.“No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,” said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill. Some of its lawmakers like Radheshyam Adhikari had criticised it strongly in the Upper House. However, it wasn't objected to by the Congress while endorsing it.Experts say this is an example of how laws are passed in Nepal. The executive includes provisions that allow for policy corruption, and these are endorsed as lawmakers do not care to engage in a thorough study and deliberations over the bill.“Policy corruption at the executive level can be checked if the lawmakers are vigilant and lawmaking is transparent,” Khimlal Devkota, a former National Assembly member who has closely studied Nepal’s law-making process, told the Post.Policy decisions in Nepal have become rather controversial. Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House.Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. “The lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.“The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.”Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process. Talking to law students on Sunday, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri said the government was creating a Suggestion Bank to receive feedback on bills. “Such feedback and suggestions will be incorporated in the bills,” he said.

In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  ","summary":"The collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress.

Why can’t we be honest about them? Especially moms. They’re the most romanticised of anyone.”One rarely comes across a book titled ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’. My first thought after stumbling onto this literary piece was what possibly could have been the author’s grudge towards her mother for naming the book with such an abrasive title. And quite fittingly, the title has made its mark by drawing attention from readers worldwide, making the book a New York Times bestseller. American writer, filmmaker, former actress, and singer Jennette McCurdy has created a stir in the literary scene with her debut book, ‘I’m glad my mom died’. The book’s main theme revolves around the complicated relationship between the author and her mother. The book also explores other themes such as abuse, child stardom and exploitation, eating disorders, grief and healing, and finally, resilience and survival. The memoir opens with the celebration of McCurdy’s sixth birthday when her mom presents her with a two-piece outfit surrounded by daisies. McCurdy throws on her best fake smile and exclaims it to be her favourite birthday gift ever. This particular event prods the readers to be cautious about the series of events that will unfold, hinting at the complex and often painful dynamics of her relationship with her mother that are to be revealed throughout the narrative.The general perception regarding abuse tends to focus primarily on physical violence overlooking other forms, such as emotional and psychological abuse. McCurdy, in her memoir, chronicles the continuum of emotional and psychological abuse she had to face throughout her childhood at the hands of her mother. Just like any other helicopter parent, McCurdy’s mother projects her unmet aspiration of becoming an actor to her daughter. She then continues to micromanage every aspect of McCurdy’s life, often pressuring her to achieve the dream that she once harboured. The authoritarian demeanour of the mother leaves McCurdy to develop OCD from a young age which she refers to as the “Holy Ghost”. Due to her age, she isn’t fully aware of how harmful the condition she was diagnosed with can be. Instead, she is thrilled to have conversations with the “Holy Ghost” where she says, “I can talk to the holy ghost whenever I want to, and he can talk to me, guiding me to do what is right, which is whatever he tells me to do. I am so lucky”. As the memoir continues, the readers find that the mother uses McCurdy’s fame to pay their bills, often flaunting her daughter’s success to maintain her unattained lifestyle. McCurdy’s struggle to make her mother understand her aspiration to become a writer instead of an actor is similar to the struggle of the character Farhan in the Bollywood hit ‘3 Idiots’, where, at last, the orthodox father finally lets his son pursue his interest of becoming a photographer. However, in McCurdy’s case, her mother is dismissive of her daughter’s ambition and instead tries to manipulate her daughter by saying, “Writer’s dress is frumpy and fat. I would never want your little actress’s peach butt to turn into a big, giant writer’s watermelon butt.”The emotional quandary of McCurdy’s is further complicated when her mother gets diagnosed with breast cancer. The mother’s manipulative behaviour leads her to make her children watch the video of her cancer diagnosis time and again until her children take it to blame themselves for the cause of their mother’s cancer. Ultimately, McCurdy considers it her job to save her mother from mortal sickness as cancer. She tries every rule in the book to get validation from her mother to the extent that she hides her preferred colour, purple, just because her mother prefers pink.The situation worsens when even after having reached the age of 16, the mother thinks it is a good idea to let her son and daughter shower in the same bathroom.Similarly, she puts McCurdy on a strict diet plan of calorie restriction. She is even made to read every diet-related book even before she gets her menstruation. The memoir is divided into two parts, i.e. before and after. ‘Before’ chronicles McCurdy’s experience with her abusive mother, whereas ‘After’ poignantly describes the harrowing effect of bulimia as a result of her mother’s years of abuse. The book also focuses on the ethical and developmental concerns of exposing a child to the limelight from a young age through McCurdy’s personal experience in the Hollywood industry. It also highlights the damage the entertainment industry can do to a child’s mental and emotional well-being.The book shines in its execution, particularly in addressing the question, “What does grief look like when you don’t share a great relationship with your loved one?” This question ties seamlessly into the title, as McCurdy struggles to recognise and cope with her emotions following her mother’s death. The universal practice of idolising one’s mother makes it difficult for her to acknowledge the abuse she endured during childhood—adding layers to her grief and healing process. Despite being a candid account of McCurdy’s experience with abuse, the nature of the memoir can resonate with Nepali readers. It mirrors the stark reality of Nepali households, where children often bear the burden of their parents’ unfulfilled dreams of securing a stable job. This restricts them from following their desire when it comes to careers. The memoir plays its part in demonstrating that fame is not everything; it is frequently nothing at all. It urges its readers to see the thin line that demarcates the life of an ordinary person and a celebrity. However, underneath the line lies a shared humanity that transcends fame and fortune, reminding us that our intrinsic value is not defined by external measures of success.The memoir should come with a trigger warning because its graphic narration of emotional abuse might make readers uncomfortable. This disrupted the linear flow of my reading experience, making it difficult to progress through the book. However, the author’s touch of sarcasm creates an engaging authorial voice. Destined to become an actor yet a natural when it comes to writing, McCurdy has set the train in motion through her candid yet moving writing. She accurately describes the mental state of her formative years, which skillfully captures the emotions she wishes to convey. The memoir ends on a hopeful note as McCurdy affirms, “Mom didn’t get better. But I will.”I’m Glad My Mom Died Author: Jennette McCurdyYear: 2022Publisher: Simon and Schuster ","summary":"Why do we romanticise the dead? Why can’t we be honest about them? Especially moms. They’re the most romanticised of anyone.”One rarely comes across a book titled ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’. My first thought after stumbling onto this literary piece was what possibly could have been the author’s grudge towards her mother for naming the book with such an abrasive title. And quite fittingly, the title has made its mark by drawing attention from readers worldwide, making the book a New York Times bestseller. American writer, filmmaker, former actress, and singer Jennette McCurdy has created a stir in the literary scene with her debut book, ‘I’m glad my mom died’. The book’s main theme revolves around the complicated relationship between the author and her mother. The book also explores other themes such as abuse, child stardom and exploitation, eating disorders, grief and healing, and finally, resilience and survival. The memoir opens with the celebration of McCurdy’s sixth birthday when her mom presents her with a two-piece outfit surrounded by daisies. McCurdy throws on her best fake smile and exclaims it to be her favourite birthday gift ever. This particular event prods the readers to be cautious about the series of events that will unfold, hinting at the complex and often painful dynamics of her relationship with her mother that are to be revealed throughout the narrative.The general perception regarding abuse tends to focus primarily on physical violence overlooking other forms, such as emotional and psychological abuse. McCurdy, in her memoir, chronicles the continuum of emotional and psychological abuse she had to face throughout her childhood at the hands of her mother. Just like any other helicopter parent, McCurdy’s mother projects her unmet aspiration of becoming an actor to her daughter. She then continues to micromanage every aspect of McCurdy’s life, often pressuring her to achieve the dream that she once harboured. The authoritarian demeanour of the mother leaves McCurdy to develop OCD from a young age which she refers to as the “Holy Ghost”. Due to her age, she isn’t fully aware of how harmful the condition she was diagnosed with can be. Instead, she is thrilled to have conversations with the “Holy Ghost” where she says, “I can talk to the holy ghost whenever I want to, and he can talk to me, guiding me to do what is right, which is whatever he tells me to do. I am so lucky”. As the memoir continues, the readers find that the mother uses McCurdy’s fame to pay their bills, often flaunting her daughter’s success to maintain her unattained lifestyle.

The ministry has sought information on the teachers and professors affiliated to the parties from the Election Commission and the respective district education units.The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017 which prohibits the teachers, professors and other government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that school teachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from the state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics. The major parties have disapproved of Shrestha’s move as a large number of teachers are their cadres. For instance, as many as 263 of the 4,743 representatives to the Nepali Congress general convention held in December 2021 were school teachers and staff. The number is above five percent of the total delegates.The main opposition CPN-UML also had dozens of teachers as representatives in its 10th general congress held in November that year. Hundreds of school teachers are associated with the CPN (Maoist Centre) as well.Leaders from all these parties have criticised the move directly or indirectly. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel said the principals of many best-performing community schools were affiliated to different parties.“It is unnecessary to test teachers’ DNA. Let them work,” he said, implying that there was no need to probe whether the teachers are affiliated to a political party.Another factor antagonising the major parties is Shrestha’s decision to make public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission— more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli.On June 7, she made public the report that Oli and his successors had for years kept under wraps. The government was under the pressure of private schools to keep the report a secret as it envisions converting the schools registered as companies into trusts within 10 years. Converting the existing schools into trusts would mean they will be barred from taking profits home. Several cross-party leaders have investments in private schools.Oli was so annoyed by Minister Shrestha’s decision to make the report public that he resorted to making personal remarks about her nationality and marital status without naming her.Now the teachers’ unions of various parties have united against her. The ministry on May 27 endorsed a directive guiding teachers’ transfers. The directive came amid allegations that teachers are being transferred without fulfilling the due procedure. The directive is accused of encroaching on the authority of the School Management Committee and increasing the ministry’s role in transfers. “Your good education is meaningless if you are doing more harm than good to the education sector,” said Shankar Adhikari, chair of the teacher association close to the Maoist Centre, referring to Shrestha’s foreign degree. “She has a shallow understanding of Nepal's education sector.”Leaders of other teacher associations have asked the minister to reverse the directive, warning of the consequences of not doing so. “The directive was issued with the mala fide intent of troubling teachers. This is unacceptable,” said Gyanedra Rawal of the Nepal Teachers’ Union, the Congress teachers’ wing.Some lawmakers and education experts, however, have supported minister Shrestha, saying she is on the right track to improve the country's education sector. Addressing the lower house meeting on Wednesday, independent lawmaker Amresh Kumar Singh said he fully supports the education minister, who is making the necessary intervention. “The education minister is taking the right course. Her works need to be appreciated,” he said.Those who have followed Shrestha’s work also praise her. “She [Shrestha] is eager to bring about vital changes, mainly in school education,” said Usha Jha, a former member of the National Planning Commission.However, many officials at the ministry are unhappy with her work. While she is dedicated to her job, she has a habit of not listening to others, they allege. “The minister thinks she knows everything and is not accommodative.

The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit.Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support.Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7.Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation.“The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.”Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari.“Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said.This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections.The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the parties in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990.Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically.The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention.The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April.The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention. The party's foreign affairs department chief, Arjun Thapa, said delegates from India, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Indonesia have already arrived in Nepal.Invitations have been extended to various parties, except the Janata Samajbadi Party led by Ashok Rai, which splintered from the JSP-Nepal. The Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) are other parties that will participate in the Janakpur convention. Party leaders say the opening ceremony will be held on Monday, whereas the closed session, which will discuss the party’s political documents, is scheduled for the subsequent days.

After a change in coalition at the centre began to affect provincial governments, voices for reforming the electoral system through constitutional amendment are growing louder. Speaking at a programme in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, a general secretary of the largest party in the House of Representatives, argued that reforming the electoral system had become necessary to ensure political stability. He also said that the provinces’ performance so far shows that the federal system cannot be sustained in its current form. “By reform in the provincial structure, I do not mean scrapping the federal system altogether, which the country cannot afford,” Thapa told the Post when asked to explain his statement. “The issue of governments’ formation in the provinces has been challenged in court. This is a result of lack of clarity on provincial government formation in the constitution.”The government formation process in Koshi and Gandaki provinces have been challenged multiple times, and the Supreme Court has many times invalidated the chief ministerial appointment and election processes in the two provinces.Questions have been raised over the expenditures for running the provincial governments. “To address this issue, we need to downsize the elected representatives’ bodies not only in the provinces but also at the federal level. For that, we need constitutional reform,” Thapa added. “We bear a collective responsibility to protect and sustain the constitution. This, however, requires some amendments. Reform in the electoral system is as important,” Thapa emphasised. The provinces followed the same process of government formation practised at the centre and that caused problems, he said. Thapa stressed that amendments to the constitution could address all these issues.The Congress leader says it is wrong to advocate either for scrapping the federal system altogether or and fully retaining the constitutional provisions on the provinces. The Rastriya Prajantara Party, which bats for the revival of the Hindu Kingdom, has been demanding the scrapping of the country’s federal structure. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which was formed two years ago, also wants the provincial structure overhauled. The new party says it wants to downsize the middle layer of the federal system. The party hasn’t participated in the provincial elections.Former National Assembly member Khim Lal Devkota, who is also an expert on federalism and a columnist at The Post, sees a slim chance of any changes in the federal system even though “it is necessary”.“I have closely worked with Nepal’s top political leaders. I believe they won’t readily amend the constitution,” Devkota told the Post. “The longer we take to amend the constitution, the more questions there will be on the longevity of the constitution.” During the Congress Mahasamiti meeting held in February, many leaders raised their voices in favour of filling all seats of the lower house of the federal parliament through direct election. Instead of electing a section of the lower house under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, the leaders had suggested that the upper house of the parliament be filled exclusively through the PR system. They were of the view that Nepal would not have a stable government unless all the lower house members were directly elected by their constituencies.Devkota is also of the opinion that Nepal needs to reform the election system. The mixed electoral system should be changed to create an environment for political instability, he said.In the 275-strong federal lower house, 165 are directly elected, whereas 110 come from the PR category. The upper chamber has 59 members. Of them, 56 are chosen through an electoral college comprising provincial assembly members and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units. Each province elects eight members, while three are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.Likewise, among the 550 members in the seven provincial assemblies, 220 are elected under the PR category. This number is large compared to the population size and thus needs to be reduced significantly, say experts.However, Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, blames the political leaders for the current problems of the provinces. Top politicians are using provincial governments and assemblies to place their second- and third-tier leaders. This has burdened the state without yielding any tangible results, he added. Pokharel says this represents a failure of the leadership rather than the federal system.Since the inception of the provincial system, political parties have appointed chief ministers on a rotational basis, Pokharel told the Post. “It is true that there are operational problems in the provinces, but leaders are more responsible for this than the system.” Even though the state structure is federal, political parties have yet to adopt the three-tier system within their organisations, he said. “What stops the political parties from giving autonomy to their provincial committees and letting them make decisions regarding the provinces on their own?” Pokharel questioned.Devkota, however, said two models should be considered to ensure the stability of provincial governments.The first involves distributing the government leadership positions based on the number of seats won in the election, and the second concerns implementing provisions similar to those at the local government level. According to the first model, the chief minister and other positions are distributed based on the number of seats shared in the provincial assembly elections, and the government is run among the constituent parties on a consensus basis.As per the second method, the chief minister is directly elected by voters, similar to the election of mayors or chairs at the local units. This makes the chief ministers fully accountable to the people. The chief minister can be removed by a two-thirds majority of the provincial assembly, thus preventing one from being an autocrat. One of the major concerns is the destabilising linkage of provincial politics with the power equation in Kathmandu. When the coalition at the centre changes, governments in the provinces also change.The subnational governments changed immediately after the change in coalition partners in Kathmandu on March 4. When Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed ruling partners, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, CPN-UML, joined the government while the largest force, the Congress, was ousted from power.

Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said.

Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.”Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.”Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago.

However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country.

","summary":"Post-monsoon is considered the dengue epidemic season. However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say.

The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses.

The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country.

It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done.

The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve ","summary":"Nepali chef Aditya Mishra promotes Nepali cuisine in New York through his supper club, \"The Sewing Tin,\" which blends traditional flavors with modern culinary techniques while highlighting the challenges and opportunities of being an outsider in the competitive culinary scene."},{"hash":"4f18229de2a5d8016e8888758de34cc858e98af2b542ed3077fa8ab2d1e49a3b","title":"Patience, passion, and pastries are interconnected:\n- Patience is essential in creating pastries, as they require careful preparation and baking.\n- Passion for baking drives the desire to create delicious and beautiful pastries.\n- Pastries provide joy and satisfaction, making the efforts of patience and passion worthwhile.","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2024/04/27/patience-passion-and-pastries","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/BakeleusbyCeleus-1714186343.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714176000000,"source":"kp","category":"recipes","content":"**Bakeleus: Serene Baker with a Passion for Nature**\n\nCeleus Baral is a baker with a calm demeanor and a love for precision.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

The author reflects on the town's evolution and how it continues to hold a special place in his heart.","summary":"Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry.

With only a single delivery remaining, Jha and his partner Sompal Kami made the run for an equaliser, but the former was run out, ending Nepal’s hopes of competing in the World Cup.For South Africa, Tabraiz Shamsi grabbed four wickets while Aiden Markram also dismissed a Nepali batter.

And the output against Yemen could possibly convince ANFA to trigger another extension in his contract. ANFA had added a three-month extension in Annese’s contract this year.The emergence of Sanjeeb, who only made his international debut in March this year as an 88th minute substitute during a 5-0 qualifiers loss to Bahrain, is even more promising.Sanjeeb, who played full 90 minutes in Nepal’s 3-0 loss against Bahrain before being benched in 4-0 defeat to the UAE, had a hand in both of Nepal’s goals against Yemen in Dammam.Sanjeeb, who replaced star forward Anjan Bista in the front, first pounced on a misplaced back pass from Radhawan Al Hubaishi and bent the ball past Yemen goalkeeper Mohammed Khairalah to score an equaliser in the 22nd minute.Sanjeeb then received a long pass from Chhiring Lama and served it for Karki to head home Nepal’s second goal in the 66th.It was the first international goals for both Sanjeeb and Karki. Karki made his debut for Nepal in September last year during Nepal’s goalless draw with Myanmar. The evening was also memorable for Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Playing his 100th international match, the 34-year-old goalkeeper produced a string of stunning saves to keep Yemen at bay till the final moments and helped Nepal earn a point.Even though Nepal failed to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and could not directly qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup, they still have a chance to secure their spot in their maiden Asian Cup through Asian Cup Qualification which will be played between March 25, 2025 to March 31, 2026.Top two teams from each nine groups qualified for the third round of 2026 FIFA World Cup and also secured a direct berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

But first, some introductions.Ever since I can remember, playing and watching cricket have been important parts of my identity. I have followed with joy the rise of Nepali cricket over the last 20 years. I am what you might call a fanatic. I never miss any Nepal match if I can help it, be it a friendly with a local club in India, a crunch qualifier against one of our nemesis associate nations, or a World Cup match against a Test nation. It does not matter what time zone a match is being played or where I am. I have also followed Sandeep Lamichhane’s career closely. He put Nepali cricket on the international map, and whether he played for the national team or some local T20 franchise, I tried to find a working link to be able to watch him play.I am establishing these credentials first because I expect fellow passionate Nepali cricket fans will rush to dismiss what comes next. But I want you to know that I love Nepali cricket just as much as you do, and so this is not part of some conspiracy to discredit Sandeep or Nepali cricket. Quite the opposite: I care about Nepali cricket too much to stay silent. At a time when populist stunts are rife, it feels necessary to speak truth to power, as an expression of love. Custodians of rape cultureMuch has been written about Sandeep’s Gaushala-26 rape case. As a rule of thumb, I choose to believe victims. The harassment she has faced—which culminated in her suicide attempt—beggars belief. She has remained steadfast against all pressure, rejecting advances to “settle” the case. It is hard to imagine why else anyone would willingly subject themselves to such inhumane treatment. This reflection, though, is not just about whether Sandeep raped Gaushala-26. My focus here is to examine Sandeep’s case as a textbook example of how our institutions perpetuate rape culture, where sexual abuse and violence are normalised. Custodian 1: The fansEver since Sandeep has been accused, the vast majority of his fans have taken to social media to defend him, as well as to defame the victim. Perhaps it is no surprise in a deeply patriarchal society in the grips of populism, where hero worship has taken new heights. Sandeep is a hero to many, and apparently he can do no wrong. Or, even if he wrongs, he is still above the law because he can bowl a mean googly, and that’s what matters. These fans- mostly but not exclusively young men- are vocal in their support for Sandeep. Even when he was a convicted felon, never mind when he was just accused of being a rapist- that too potentially of a minor- cricket mattered more to his devotees. Such craze toward their favourite cricketer substantially sustained a rape culture where allegations of sexual abuse were relegated to oblivion. When an overwhelming, assertive, visible, and vitriolic population aggressively downplays rape charges, it extinguishes any hope victims might have in their elusive quest for justice. Custodian 2: The courtsEvery level of the court system has already weighed in on Sandeep’s case. The Supreme Court—in its infinite wisdom—allowed him to represent the national team and travel abroad while on trial for rape charges. Along with the Prime Minister, who found it fitting to felicitate Sandeep in the middle of his trial, the Supreme Court’s tacit endorsement of Sandeep has made a mockery of victims’ rights and cemented rape culture as the established norm in Nepal. The Kathmandu District Court was at least bold enough to convict Sandeep of rape, though it did not find the victim to be a minor, which would have led to more significant consequences for Sandeep. Knowledge sources had commented then that this was already paving the way for a successful appeal later, which soon came to pass. The High Court overturned that conviction, acquitting Sandeep of all charges. Almost instantaneously, the fans came out in droves and celebrated that decision. Social media is swarmed with comments about how if Sandeep was punished when convicted, he should be reinstated immediately now that he is acquitted. It is an open secret that the judiciary- like many other institutions in Nepal- is compromised. Power and privilege run deep, and decisions are not just made on the merits of the legal argument. To all the fans now celebrating Sandeep’s acquittal and making that the basis for his rehabilitation, I have just one question: If you are from a poor family and if your loved one is sexually assaulted by someone rich, powerful, or politically connected, do you genuinely expect our judicial system to impart justice and punish the perpetrator? Take a moment, put yourself in the shoes of Gaushala-26’s family, and reflect on this question. If you honestly believe that justice would be served, I have a bridge to sell you.Custodian 3: CAN and the cricketing fraternityThe Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has towed a fine line, appearing to uphold the law in the strictest sense. As soon as Sandeep was convicted, CAN suspended him from all cricketing activities. He was only reinstated after he was acquitted by the High Court. Dig a bit deeper though, and rape culture rears its ugly head. Even while facing serious rape charges, CAN was not compelled by any sense of morality to prevent him from representing Nepal. Within moments of the High Court’s acquittal, CAN officials rushed to announce that Sandeep had been reinstated. They went above and beyond to lobby the US Embassy to grant him a visa on time. When that failed, they facilitated his travel to St. Vincent and the Grenadines for him to play the remaining matches. They have lobbied the International Cricket Council to ensure his inclusion while sacrificing another player from the squad. To be sure, CAN has faced incredible scrutiny and received intense pressure from “the fans” to back Sandeep. Yet, the rush to not only rehabilitate but actually elevate Sandeep demonstrates that CAN only saw the case as a nuisance. Even if the legal burden of proof might not have been met, CAN could and should have investigated whether Sandeep met the national team’s code of conduct, as has been customary in similar cases around the world. It should have taken time to study the decision, and it could have waited for the legal process to reach its logical conclusion; it is all but certain that a Supreme Court appeal will follow. What CAN has not done speaks volumes of how rape culture is sustained in Nepal. To my knowledge, no official has spoken publicly about whether Sandeep’s actions violated the expectations placed on national players, or expressed concern or solidarity for the victim. The reasons for Sandeep’s absence have been conveniently ignored, as if he has simply been on holiday or nursing a minor injury. Just as his absence was unexplained, so too has his return been left ‘unsaid’. The gaslighting of the entire saga shows the contempt with which the issue is treated in Nepal. The wider cricketing fraternity—which includes players, former players, coaches, commentators, sponsors, and officials—has, at best, adopted a veil of silence or, at worst, come out publicly in Sandeep’s support. Respected national and international commentators have found it convenient to use phrases such as “Sandeep is not available” when away and “Sandeep, the talisman of Nepali cricket, is back” now, without any mention of the dark context. A moment to engage with and educate a whole nation on how to take rape charges, and its victim, seriously has been left unaddressed. Because, of course, cricket comes first. A naïve hopeI expect the backlash to this piece to be swift and severe. It feels poignant that I am travelling to watch Nepal play in the World Cup in the very matches Sandeep will now play. But his celebrated return has filled me with dread, anxiety, and disgust, to the point that I do not know how to support my beloved team anymore. Spare a thought for Gaushala-26 and for all victims of rape and rape culture. Regardless of the legalese, we must strive to build a culture where victims are empowered and supported to speak up and stand for the truth. Nepali cricket has always found a way through adversity, often miraculously. Our obsession with star power must be replaced with a focus on the role cricket, and citizens, should play in sustaining a culture of accountability and respect for victims. As amazing as it is, cricket is still only a game and must become a vehicle for good, not evil.  "},{"hash":"3018e0cd852281b75e6dcfdcd4e13f586a05303093adf722cb8fb62bba5799d5","title":"**Victims' Rights and Criminal Prosecution**\n\nVictims of crime have certain rights to ensure they are treated fairly and kept informed during the criminal justice process.

But when it rains money on roads and project sites, we may consider that, too, to be a sign of the month’s onset. Each year, as the fiscal year enters the eleventh month, government agencies and contractors wake up from their slumber and pull up their socks to either make payments or work for the payments received. Last-minute capital spending repeats each financial year, exposing the inefficiency with which Nepal’s development sector operates. This model of “development” has a nomenclature of its own—Asarey Vikaas. Thanks to the Asarey Vikas model, the roads that were bumpy until last night would have turned smooth and shiny this morning. Roads often become the sites for the manifestation of such an ill-planned model of development, leaving even the locals who have learnt not to expect anything from the government surprised at the sudden transformation of their roads. After all, the government has money to spend, and contractors have work to finish to claim that money. But such hurried spending has a major problem: The work being done is substandard. The road that was blacktopped overnight to meet the spending deadline of this financial year will hardly last until the end of the next financial year. Between June 10 and July 15, 2020, the capital spending jumped by 17 percent in the last month of the fiscal year as the government rushed to increase such expenditure. Before the rush, the capital expenditure had been just 30 percent in the first 11 months of that fiscal year. In FY 2020/21, the government spent 21 percent of the total budget in a single month, between mid-June and mid-July. As of June 12, a little over a month before the end of FY 2023/24, capital expenditure was a mere 44 percent, which means that the government has failed to spend the budget allocated, making it difficult to meet the development targets. Experts blame bureaucratic red tape for the delay in capital expenditure, as it takes months for even small amounts of bills to be cleared. Moreover, projects are often initiated randomly without ensuring the financial resources, leading to failure to move them forward. Previous governments tried to address the problem through budget implementation guidelines. Last year, the government made it mandatory to complete the call for bids and contract signing of projects by mid-November and begin work within 15 days of the signing. It said the plans and programmes that failed to meet this deadline would not get any budget. The 81-point budget implementation guideline has specific provisions on project completion timeline, payment, budget transfers and other matters of financial discipline. The government cannot maintain a lacklustre attitude when it comes to capital expenditure, as it has a detrimental effect on the country’s overall development. It is time to streamline the monitoring, evaluation and payment systems to ensure that the government’s plans and programmes move forward and are completed within the stipulated deadline. The last-minute spending rush should become a thing of the past—which will also be a solid proof of the government’s commitment to improving people’s lives through judicious spending.  ","summary":"Torrential rains mark the onset of Asar, signifying a surge in last-minute capital spending, known as 'Asarey Vikas,' characterized by hasty and substandard road construction due to government and contractor urgency to meet financial deadlines."},{"hash":"ea9e788f50612c9bca4ade5a3014cffa8103356d31dec404d22743a6c00f8ee9","title":"enter-monsoon","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/11/enter-monsoon","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/default/thumb-1718154296.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718064000000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"**Monsoon in Nepal: Challenges and Concerns**\n\nThe monsoon brings both benefits and risks, but recent changes have led to more harm than good.\n\n**Concerns for this Monsoon:**\n\n* Predicted above-normal rains and temperatures\n* Increased risk of floods, landslides, and epidemics\n\n**Challenges in Disaster Response:**\n\n* Lack of effective coordination between government levels\n* Limited resources for local rescuers\n* Failure to rehabilitate disaster-displaced people\n* Weak public awareness and early warning systems\n\n**Health Risks:**\n\n* Increase in water- and vector-borne diseases, such as dengue and cholera\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Comprehensive disaster preparedness and response plans\n* Coordinated efforts between ministries\n* Relocation and rehabilitation for at-risk communities\n* Public awareness campaigns\n* Focus on disease prevention and control\n* Address climate change to mitigate future disasters","summary":"When it arrives, it can bring both bounty and bane. However, due to a changing climate, monsoons in recent times have invariably resulted in more hardship than help. This monsoon, which arrived in Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual date, will certainly buoy farmers and provide much-needed relief from the blistering heat, but concerns over its severity still loom large. Experts have predicted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures. As this will exacerbate floods, landslides and epidemics, disaster preparedness becomes crucial.Our responses to natural disasters have consistently fallen short. Governments come and go, but the same pattern repeats every year, and hundreds of lives, and a whole lot of properties and physical infrastructure are left at nature’s mercy. Not that the country has no plans and policies for disaster preparedness. This year, as in previous ones, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has devised the Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan, which is commendable. The necessary logistics and emergency relief materials have also been stockpiled in all provinces, according to officials. The problem, however, is with the execution of these plans. This monsoon is estimated to put 1.81 million people and 412,000 households at risk, and require 18,000 rescues. These numbers are large, suggesting the necessity for a comprehensive response to disasters and ensuring that relief programmes reach the most vulnerable and needy. Lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels has also caused several problems during disasters. Local governments play a big role as primary rescuers in floods and landslides, but they are still far short in human and financial resources. The examples from the earthquake-devastated Rukum West, Sindhupalchowk and several other places highlight how Nepal fails to rehabilitate the disaster-displaced people for long periods. The residents of Rukum West are still obliged to live in houses with cracks and fissures, and experts warn that these houses could be badly damaged this monsoon. There is also high risk to those living in high landslide and flood prone areas. Unless we design approaches that include not only immediate relief programmes but also year-round relocation, rehabilitation, monitoring and study, people will continue to suffer. Also, proactive measures like public awareness and early warning should be strengthened.Moreover, monsoons are notorious for water- and vector-borne diseases, including dengue, cholera and typhoid. Dengue cases are already being reported from different parts of the country and the caseload will likely increase during and after the monsoon. Water resource contamination has surged in the past few months, leading to a higher number of water-borne disease cases in hospitals. During the monsoon preparedness, the authorities shouldn’t overlook these epidemics and focus particularly on areas that are more prone to diseases and, therefore, need timely healthcare intervention and workers.A coordinated effort from health, home, urban development and water supply ministries can help make this monsoon a lot safer. In the long run, we should find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, which has exacerbated our climatic conditions and intensified disasters. Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on weather will help us better prepare for future monsoons and the disasters that come in their wake.  "},{"hash":"5d5a3d2d5e23b861dd01fa9e674e5c9558540ceefa04c8cac169de3a8bbc9130","title":"chart-your-own-path","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/11/chart-your-own-path","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/CT28janakpur2820210402015453IMG79721copymin-1718067175.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718064000000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"The Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal inaugurated its second general convention on Monday.

Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces.

Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces.

The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.

During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  ","summary":"Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015.

The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition.
