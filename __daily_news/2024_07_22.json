We\nhave been scaling up the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme\nacross the world, and I’m beyond happy that we’ll now also be supporting midwives\nand other healthcare professionals in Nepal in ensuring safer births for women and\nbabies,” says Anna Frellsen, CEO of Maternity Foundation.  \nThe Nepali version of the App, which contains thirteen modules, has been developed\nin collaboration with UNFPA and Family Welfare Division, Department of Health\nServices, Ministry of Health and Population and other partners.\nIn addition to the new Nepali version, the digital tool is also available in five global\nversions based on WHO guidelines (English, French, Arabic, Spanish and\nPortuguese) and more than 30 language versions, adapted to national contexts and\nneeds.\n\n\n\n"},{"hash":"c6706e880a592c6cdb82a6bf33af84d20511569822786234c0881069bd916bc0","title":"dengue-infection-spreads-over-71-districts","date":1721629962109,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/health/dengue-infection-spreads-over-71-districts","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/MoHP_Health_Ministry_Ministry_of_Health_and_Population1679644101_10241697441609_1024.jpg","category":"health","content":"\n Dengue infection has spread over 71 districts is the country.

Of these 420 crossed into Nepal on Sunday alone, the ministry said.It was difficult to get updates on the Nepali students in Bangladesh as telecommunication and internet services have been disrupted.Suja Chhetri of Kathmandu, a student at a dental college in Rangapur in northwestern Bangladesh, arrived in Kakadbhitta on Sunday morning. “We returned home after our college transported us up to the Banglabandha border point. Many Nepali students from Dhaka and other cities are returning home,” said Chhetri, whom the Post met on the premises of the Immigration Office at Kakadbhitta on Sunday. Some students directly landed in Kathmandu by air while the majority are returning through land routes.According to the Immigration Office in Kakadbhitta, more and more Nepali students have been arriving through Kakadbhitta over the past one week. As per the data provided by the office, 85 students entered Nepal on Thursday, and 114 and 141 students arrived in Jhapa on Friday and Saturday, respectively. On Sunday, more than 305 students came home through the Banglabandha border point.“Around 700 students have returned home through Kakadbhitta over the past one week. The arrival of Nepali students via land routes is expected to continue for a few more days,” said Mohan Lal Paneru, chief at the Immigration Office in Kakadbhitta.Over 3,500 Nepali students are currently pursuing various courses in Bangladesh, with most enrolled in medical and agricultural courses.Bibisha Neupane of Kathmandu, who has been studying in Rangapur-based Community Medical College, said Nepali students have been cut off from their families and relatives due to the protests. “We lost contact with our families when telecommunication and internet services were cut off. I called my family immediately after arriving in Kakadbhitta and they were relieved,” said Neupane.Bangladeshi students have intensified their protest against government job quotas, which includes a 30 percent reservation for the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan in 1971. The protests flared up in Dhaka. “There was not much impact from the protest in our area [Rangapur], but our college sent us home citing security reasons,” said Neupane. According to her, some Nepali students are still at the hostel.The border of Bangladesh is around 35 kilometres from Kakadbhitta, Jhapa. Nepali students are returning home through the Phulbari-Banglabandha border point between Bangladesh and India. Meanwhile, a total of 56 Nepali students returned home by air from Bangladesh on Sunday. They landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, on a Biman Bangladesh flight.According to Amrit Bahadur Rai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they arrived at Tribhuvan International Airport at 11:30am.“We were expecting 17 students, but 56 have arrived,” he said. “We have deployed officials from the ministry to the airport.” Rai said exact details of the plight of Nepali students is hard to establish due to communication issues with the Nepali embassy in Bangladesh. “The telephone connection there is poor, and the internet is down,” Rai said.Bangladesh witnessed violent agitation in the past week. The government clamped curfew on Friday to control the violent student protests that have killed over 150 people. The curfew was extended on Sunday for an indefinite time following a two-hour relaxation to allow people to stock up on essentials, among other things.“The Embassy of Nepal in Dhaka has coordinated with most of the students to facilitate their safe travel from various places in Bangladesh to Dhaka airport or to related border points,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a post on X late evening on Saturday. “It has been closely coordinating with universities, concerned authorities, and law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh.”The ministry reiterated the government’s commitment to ensuring safety and security of all Nepali students in the South Asian country that has witnessed violent agitation in the past one week.Meanwhile, posting an ‘urgent notice’ on X, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba urged the students, their guardians and kin to submit rescue applications through the online link (https://mofa.gov.np) arranged by the ministry.Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi Supreme Court on Sunday ordered that the quota for veterans’ descendants be cut to 5 percent, with 93 percent of jobs to be allocated on merit. The remaining 2 percent will be set aside for members of ethnic minorities and transgender and disabled people. ","summary":"Nepali students started arriving home from Bangladesh via land border or by air following violent anti-government protests in Bangladesh over the past few days.By Sunday evening, more than 1,200 students have returned to Nepal, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on social media. Of these 420 crossed into Nepal on Sunday alone, the ministry said.It was difficult to get updates on the Nepali students in Bangladesh as telecommunication and internet services have been disrupted.Suja Chhetri of Kathmandu, a student at a dental college in Rangapur in northwestern Bangladesh, arrived in Kakadbhitta on Sunday morning. “We returned home after our college transported us up to the Banglabandha border point. Many Nepali students from Dhaka and other cities are returning home,” said Chhetri, whom the Post met on the premises of the Immigration Office at Kakadbhitta on Sunday. Some students directly landed in Kathmandu by air while the majority are returning through land routes.According to the Immigration Office in Kakadbhitta, more and more Nepali students have been arriving through Kakadbhitta over the past one week. As per the data provided by the office, 85 students entered Nepal on Thursday, and 114 and 141 students arrived in Jhapa on Friday and Saturday, respectively. On Sunday, more than 305 students came home through the Banglabandha border point.“Around 700 students have returned home through Kakadbhitta over the past one week. The arrival of Nepali students via land routes is expected to continue for a few more days,” said Mohan Lal Paneru, chief at the Immigration Office in Kakadbhitta.Over 3,500 Nepali students are currently pursuing various courses in Bangladesh, with most enrolled in medical and agricultural courses.Bibisha Neupane of Kathmandu, who has been studying in Rangapur-based Community Medical College, said Nepali students have been cut off from their families and relatives due to the protests. “We lost contact with our families when telecommunication and internet services were cut off. I called my family immediately after arriving in Kakadbhitta and they were relieved,” said Neupane.Bangladeshi students have intensified their protest against government job quotas, which includes a 30 percent reservation for the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan in 1971. The protests flared up in Dhaka. “There was not much impact from the protest in our area [Rangapur], but our college sent us home citing security reasons,” said Neupane. According to her, some Nepali students are still at the hostel.The border of Bangladesh is around 35 kilometres from Kakadbhitta, Jhapa. Nepali students are returning home through the Phulbari-Banglabandha border point between Bangladesh and India.

The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource.

Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource.

However, the proportion of tourists visiting the country’s first national park has changed, with nearly 58 percent of visitors to the park being domestic tourists.The increased numbers have cheered tourism entrepreneurs, but conservationists say that rising footfalls may pose bigger threats to wildlife. They have stressed the need for effective conservation action now more than ever.The national park is home to tigers, one-horned rhinos, elephants, gharials, birds, and more, but the biggest draw is the famed Royal Bengal tiger.Ganesh Prasad Tiwari, conservation officer, said 306,837 people visited the park in the last fiscal year, contributing Rs367.29 in revenue. The number of tourists in the previous fiscal year was 299,412, and the revenue was Rs298.96 million. “Both the tourist numbers and the revenue are the highest.”Chitwan National Park, established in 1973, is Nepal’s first national park. Located in the southern central Tarai, the property covers an area of 93,200 hectares and extends over four districts: Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Parsa, and Makwanpur.It is a habitat of endangered animals such as one-horned rhinos, tigers, gharials, and crocodiles.Wild elephants, many birds, aquatic animals, and plants are also found here. The tribal Tharu, Bote, Kumal, and Darai live in the park surroundings, and tourists also prefer to observe their culture and lifestyle.With its rich biodiversity, the park has received several international recognitions for conservation and has, over the years, also gained popularity as a wildlife safari destination.The park, which relies heavily on tourism revenue, and the hundreds of people who depend on tourism for survival, faced an unprecedented drought in tourism when the Covid pandemic hit Nepal two years ago.Foreign tourists stopped coming to Chitwan after the Covid-19 pandemic, which inadvertently threatened humans' and animals' livelihoods and survival. However, officials said that tourism recovered in Chitwan at a fast pace.The increased footfall brings money but also many challenges, conservationists say.If the numbers keep rising, there is an emerging risk of habitat degradation, biodiversity loss, increased human-wildlife interaction, and disease transmission, said Tika Giri, a senior conservationist who was a nature guide in 1980. “These need effective conservation action now more than ever before.”He said there is unhealthy competition in the resorts. “Undercutting tariff rates in resorts to attract tourists should be stopped. It’s not a healthy way to promote wildlife tourism. Competition should be in providing service, not slashing the rates.”Giri said that conservation seems to have been neglected after the earthquake, blockade, and the coronavirus lockdown.Currently, the Jeep Safari, one of the popular activities, is closed due to the monsoon. However, other activities occur in the park's buffer zone, particularly in the community forest areas.During the tourist season, elephant safaris in the Baghmara Community Forest of Sauraha and jeep and boat safaris on the Rapti river are very popular.During the tourist season (March-May and September-November), more than 500 people go boating in Narayani and Rapti daily. Similarly, 70 elephants are used for safaris daily. Although June to August is the slack season due to the monsoon, it has prevented tourists from visiting the park.Babita Chaudhary, another hotelier, said that the effect of increased numbers of wildlife goers needs to be seen in business. “The business has grown slightly compared to the Covid period, but there’s not much to cheer about.”In the last fiscal year, more than half of the park visitors were Nepalis. Of the total tourists, 176,316 were domestic.The park maintains details of Nepalis, and visitors from the SAARC region and the outer world. The number of tourists from the third country amounted to 94,050, while there were 36,471 visitors from the SAARC countries. At one time, more than 60 percent of the tourists visiting the park were foreigners. Chaudhary said that the number of foreign tourists in Chitwan has dropped sharply and requested the government to implement effective marketing and promotional activities in the key source markets.“The world, including Nepal, is facing an economic slowdown. The roads are in a poor state. In such a situation, there are many challenges.”The highest number of foreign tourists Chitwan received was in 2014-15. Excluding visitors from SAARC, there were 127,000 foreigners, the highest number recorded so far. Giri said that wildlife is Chitwan’s tourism attraction. “We need to save our identity. The park and its surrounding forests and environment should be protected. Picnics and dances, which cause disturbances to wildlife, should not be promoted.” Jagnarayan Bote, the leader of the Bote community who runs a homestay in Chitwan Madi Pandav Nagar, said that expanding tourism in all areas would benefit the locals.Tourists who visit Chitwan Park enjoy activities such as jeep safari, elephant safari, boat safari, and walking through the forest with an experienced nature guide. Ganga Giri, president of the Chitwan Sauraha Regional Hotel Association, said that due to the one-way jeep safari route from Sauraha to the park’s west, the crowding has increased, and tourism and wildlife have also been affected. Tiwari, the park's conservation officer, said they are making arrangements for a new jeep safari route.

Rana Magar recently came into controversy after a letter she wrote to the American Embassy in Kathmandu, urging the embassy to expedite visa dates for some people, came to light. In the letter dated 26 February 2023, she has asked the consular general at the embassy to arrange visa dates for six people, including herself. The other five are Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung. The communication was made on the official letterhead of the House of Representatives. The letter says the six were attending the 67th session of Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023, and she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. In normal course, the Parliament Secretariat makes such requests on behalf of the speaker and deputy speaker via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. What is even more unusual is that Rana Magar admits that she knew only one of the other five people mentioned in the letter. Some media reports have also published material suggesting that the deputy speaker accepted money in return for lobbying for visa dates. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which nominated her to the state position, has denounced her ‘media trial’ and an attempt at ‘character assassination’. In her own defence, Rana Magar has put out a statement saying that she wrote the letter “out of compassion” for the grassroots folks who would otherwise never get to go abroad. These arguments are difficult to buy. It is inappropriate for a deputy speaker to recommend complete strangers for a programme to which they are not even remotely connected. Another problem is that Rana Magar has been changing her statements. For instance, when the controversy first surfaced, she said she had signed no such letter. Later, she admitted to signing and sending it. Both Rana Magar and the RSP have questioned why the letter, written a year and a half ago, has been made public now. They say it is aimed at removing Rana Magar from the Constitutional Council. (Deputy Speaker is an ex-officio member of the council that recommends chiefs and members of constitutional bodies). Perhaps. Yet the RSP does not have a plausible explanation for why it did nothing even though the letter came to the notice of its top officials at least three months ago.There are a few indubitable facts. One, there is no doubt that Rana Magar wrote that letter. Two, in doing so, she abused her authority. As far as accusations of monetary exchanges are concerned, they are a matter of investigation. Any way you see it, this issue calls for a thorough parliamentary investigation. Someone in Rana Magar’s position does not have the luxury of making such ‘innocent’ mistakes—or even what little prestige that remains of the state’s high offices will quickly vanish. If there was a criminal motive, the implications of a high-ranking state official engaging in human trafficking are worse still.

The letter says the six were attending the 67th session of Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023, and she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. In normal course, the Parliament Secretariat makes such requests on behalf of the speaker and deputy speaker via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. What is even more unusual is that Rana Magar admits that she knew only one of the other five people mentioned in the letter. Some media reports have also published material suggesting that the deputy speaker accepted money in return for lobbying for visa dates. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which nominated her to the state position, has denounced her ‘media trial’ and an attempt at ‘character assassination’. In her own defence, Rana Magar has put out a statement saying that she wrote the letter “out of compassion” for the grassroots folks who would otherwise never get to go abroad. These arguments are difficult to buy. It is inappropriate for a deputy speaker to recommend complete strangers for a programme to which they are not even remotely connected. Another problem is that Rana Magar has been changing her statements. For instance, when the controversy first surfaced, she said she had signed no such letter. Later, she admitted to signing and sending it. Both Rana Magar and the RSP have questioned why the letter, written a year and a half ago, has been made public now. They say it is aimed at removing Rana Magar from the Constitutional Council. (Deputy Speaker is an ex-officio member of the council that recommends chiefs and members of constitutional bodies). Perhaps. Yet the RSP does not have a plausible explanation for why it did nothing even though the letter came to the notice of its top officials at least three months ago.There are a few indubitable facts. One, there is no doubt that Rana Magar wrote that letter. Two, in doing so, she abused her authority. As far as accusations of monetary exchanges are concerned, they are a matter of investigation. Any way you see it, this issue calls for a thorough parliamentary investigation. Someone in Rana Magar’s position does not have the luxury of making such ‘innocent’ mistakes—or even what little prestige that remains of the state’s high offices will quickly vanish. If there was a criminal motive, the implications of a high-ranking state official engaging in human trafficking are worse still.

This marks a regression from the previous term, when women held four out of 20 positions, which is already a low number. Such invisibilisation of women is concerning in a country where women comprise 51.1 percent of the population. The current composition of the Cabinet raises serious questions about Nepal and the newly appointed government's commitment to gender equality and social inclusion (GESI). It is not only the women who have been sidelined; there are no Dalits in Oli’s Cabinet.The recent appointments suggest that our political leaders no longer attempt to maintain the \"illusion of inclusion\" or \"tokenistic representation\", given that women’s representation in the Cabinet dropped from a low 20 percent to a concerning 9 percent. It reflects a serious lack of power position for women in political decision-making. If women still lack visible power in such leadership positions, is there any hope of an invisible or hidden power working in their favour? A mirage of inclusionHistorically, Nepali women’s exclusion from open spaces of power has been a common practice, with numerous women leaders having to fight battles against patriarchal norms. Women have struggled for the right to vote, inherit property, or even join the so-called male-dominated professions like politics. The exclusion of women representatives from political spaces further undermines their ability to claim any space. If women are continually shut out from high-level positions such as the Cabinet of Ministers, it is unlikely that hopeful youth can see meaningful representation. This situation sends an extremely disheartening message to young women who aspire to join political leadership in a federal and democratic Nepal. The fact that the political ambitions of many women may be unattainable in a system that perpetuates patriarchy and misogyny is severely demoralising.A power cube framework explains that women can access power in certain spaces, forms and levels while others remain inaccessible. In terms of power levels, since time immemorial, women have predominantly exerted influence at the household level. However, through activism and women’s rights movements at the local, national and international levels (creating a pyramid of power), dents have been made to rightly put a few women in decision-making positions. In the last elections, female representatives at the local level (elected and nominated) comprised approximately 14,465 out of 35,097. In contrast, at the national level (National Assembly and House of Representatives), there were just 115 women out of 334 elected representatives. This difference underscores how structures of hidden inequality perpetuate gendered power dynamics, which are distinctly unequal. In terms of forms of power and spaces claimed by women, they tend to emphasise the structural, discursive and symbolic barriers women face. Structurally, women have historically held fewer formal positions of power, and the current Cabinet composition only reinforces this disparity. Discursively, women's issues are often sidelined or superficially addressed in political discourse, lacking the depth and seriousness they deserve. Symbolically, fewer women in power send a detrimental message about the perceived capabilities and roles of women in leadership, further entrenching gender biases as well as imposter syndrome. The barriers withinAt a personal level, the individual experiences and challenges female political leaders face in positions of power are critical. They must navigate a predominantly male environment, facing biases and obstacles in their work alongside manoeuvering petty politics often thrown at them by subordinates with conscious/sub-conscious patriarchal mindsets. Institutionally, political parties and other actors promote or hinder women's decision-making. The lack of proactive measures to ensure women's active representation and participation indicates a failure at the institutional level to support gender equality and inclusion. Societally, public perceptions and cultural attitudes toward women in leadership remain a significant barrier, with deep-seated patriarchal norms and values that continue to undermine women's political ambitions and achievements.Nepal's regression is part of a global and regional trend of declining women's political representation and rising right-wing sentiments. Only 13 percent of countries have effectively implemented gender quotas, resulting in disparities in women's political representation. Globally, women make up just 23.3 percent of Cabinet ministers. In South Asia, India's local-level progress hasn't translated nationally, with only 74 women making up the 2024 Lok Sabha. Our situation mirrors these global trends, where political, social and cultural factors undermine equality. Right-wing populist governments often exacerbate this issue by prioritising traditional gender roles and enacting policies that undermine gender equality. But this narrative sets the world back to times before the First Wave of Feminism and hence, second-class citizenship.Compared to the previous term, the 45 percent reduction in women's representation in the Cabinet is a significant step backwards and must not be ignored. In Nepal, the electoral representation system mandates that women hold 33 percent of seats in federal and provincial parliaments and 40 percent in local governments. Despite these measures, women remain significantly underrepresented in executive roles. This raises pertinent questions regarding our leaders’ sense of accountability, as it seems they no longer care about the optics of representation, at the very least. Concerns about whether party-heavy agendas and personal gain have led to the dismissal of issues concerning women and social minorities must be addressed.Reclaiming political spacesNepal seems to be struggling to move beyond the second wave of feminism, which focuses on legal inequalities, to the third wave and beyond, which addresses broader issues of inclusivity and intersectionality. Unsurprisingly, both women in the new Cabinet come from upper-caste Brahmin-Chettri communities, which yet again pose questions about the representation of women from marginalised communities that are severely lacking in top-ministerial positions. Who will remind the patriarchally inclined leaders of the history of hard work and contributions of women leaders to public life, which the former seem so conveniently to erase or forget?The current state of the Cabinet is not just a disappointment; it is an outrage. It signals a potential reversal of the efforts toward creating a more inclusive and equitable Nepali society. We must question whether our leaders are actively perpetuating the false narrative that 'women are not interested in politics' or 'not capable enough to navigate the complexity of the domain' by erasing their opportunities to claim leadership roles in the first place. And whether this tactic is aimed at further silencing women leaders.This underrepresentation profoundly impacts the potential for generational progress and the overall ecosystem of progressive development. It also restricts the diversity of perspectives in decision-making processes, which is crucial for formulating comprehensive and inclusive policies. Research by the UN Women indicates that gender-diverse leadership teams tend to foster more innovative and effective governance strategies, contributing to more equitable and sustainable societal outcomes. The systemic exclusion of women from high-level political roles not only undermines the democratic principle of equal representation but also stifles the social and economic advancements that arise from inclusive leadership.It is time political actors recognised the importance of representational leadership and took concrete steps to ensure that women, particularly those from marginalised communities, have a seat at the table and real decision-making powers. Alongside 'shattering the glass ceiling,' the phenomenon of climbing the ‘broken ladder’ must be mended. Only then can Nepal hope to move forward and embody the principles of gender equality and social inclusion that are fundamental to a democratic and just society.

On the same occasion, poet Bairagi Kainla alias Tilabikram Nembang of Panchthar and LP Joshi of Dhankuta were honoured for their contributions to promoting folk culture, literature and songs in their different ways. Madanraj Thapa, president of the Janakavi Keshari Dharmaraj Savitri Thapa Pratishthan, invited me to speak about the bard’s musical journey. Scholar Jagaman Gurung critically assessed the hypocritical attitudes seen in ethnic participation and rejections in culture and literature.I have always been a great admirer and follower of some bards of our times. Most prominent among them are Dharmaraj Thapa (1924-2014) and the American bard Bob Dylan. Dylan came to prominence in the 60s of the 20th century. A culture of rebellion and protest shaped the ethos of that time. The hypocrisy and interventionist nature of the state were the most prominent features. Youths rejected certain practices and policies promoted by the establishments. Bob Dylan gave voice to the spirit of rebellion and protest. His rise was phenomenal. The early 60s were the most sensitive and important moments in the history of youths in America and everywhere else. There was a certain sense of rush among the artists, especially the singers and poets. A need for action guided that sense of rush; it was the youths who felt that rush. We can understand the rush if we see the composition of the prominent protest songs and singing in the early years of the 60s. I remember I used to sing or chant some of Bob Dylan's songs like “Blowin' in the Wind”, “Maggie's Farm”, “Talkin' World War III Blues”, “Hurricane 1975”, “Only a Pawn in Their Game”, and “A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall”, to recall a few. Dylan Thomas, a Welsh poet, rose to prominence by singing Bob Dylan’s protest songs. Interestingly, Bob Dylan’s influence became global. People used to go around singing the prophetic and urgent questions of Bob Dylan, as in this song, \"How many roads must a man walk down/Before you call him a man?/ How many seas must a white dove sail/ Before she sleeps in the sand?/ Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly/ Before they're forever banned?/ The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind/ The answer is blowin' in the wind.\"It is very interesting and important to recall that Dharmaraj Thapa’s musical odyssey covered terrains similar to Bob Dylan’s. We should look at some similar features of the two bards, Bob Dylan and Dharmaraj Thapa, especially on the following scores. Dharmaraj Thapa, who came earlier than Bob Dylan, knew that songwriting and singing were the most effective means of protest and social change. Dharmaraj Thapa worked at the transitional times of Nepali history and society. Nepali society was trying to emerge from the deep-rooted feudal culture and autocratic rule of the Ranas (1846-1950). So, one way of doing that was by directly evocating the spirit of rebellion. Dharmaraj Thapa wrote and sang such songs. I want to quote the appropriate extracts of the songs from memory and translate them in the following manner: \"Oh brother, what are you looking below the path/ It is a world looted by these rich people. (batomuni ke herchau daju)…Do you think you can extinguish the flames of hunger/ Only by lamenting and shading tears? (nivla ra bhokako jwala aansule…).\"Dharmaraj Thapa directly evokes rebellion in his songs. I was struck by similar characters in Bob Dylan's songs when I first encountered them. The Vietnam War and the fast dissolution of values shaped the ethos of the time. Youths with modus vivendi, not encountered before, appeared in different parts of the world. But earlier than that, Dharmaraj Thapa had realised that to bring about social change, you need to evoke the agencies or those who would be proactive for that. That is why he reached out to KI Singh, a rebel who fought against feudal values and societal influence. Singh's theory was that the revolution had not achieved its goal. There is a need to do more. KI Singh, in that process, fled to China to avoid incarceration. He stayed in China for three years and eight months before returning in 1955. Dharmaraj Thapa wrote and sang a song about KI Singh when the latter went to self-exile in China. He was even harassed for that. The song \"krantikari he bira ke aai sing oh”, “revolutionary brave KI Singh, where did you go by breaking the jail!\" I learned to sing the song by hearing Dharmaraj Thapa. I can still sing some important parts of it. It is a difficult song because of its high-pitched music and the expressive energy that is required for this. The bard did not want to dwell too much on this song later.There was one other quality in Dharmaraj Thapa's singing, which was his versatile choice of motifs. He sang about Buddha and his pervasive and benign influence at the opening of the first Buddhist conference held in Nepal in November 1956. Nepal being the land of the Buddha's birth, the conference was held here to mark the 2500th anniversary of the Mahaparinirvana of Lord Buddha and organised by the Dharmodaya Sabha founded in Sri Lanka in 1950. The melody and composition come out brilliantly in the singing of Dharmaraj Thapa. The bard travelled to different parts of Nepal and Nepali settlements in India, singing about consciousness-raising and the need to shape one's future by fighting for equality and dignity, which are the features of Dharmaraj Thapa's entire oeuvre. Out of his 24 or so books, most are collections and interpretations of songs. He also sang these songs. He has published an account of his travels, Mero Nepal Bhraman (2016 BS), within Nepal. The bard has included his findings of folk songs, his impression of people and the geography that he covered.Dharmaraj Thapa not only collected and sang but also wrote songs, some of which can be rated as very good poetical works in Nepali. He is one of the prominent poets of Nepal, but his advantage was that he had a very good voice, and he could draw large crowds when he sang without any accompaniment and musical facilities. That was a rare quality of a singer whose singing was a poetic recitation and means of communication with the people who adored him.

That Oli would pull the rug out from under Dahal was almost certain in March itself when the two communist leaders plotted the Nepali Congress's ouster from the government—it was a matter of when, not if. Oli had been scheming all along to be back in Baluwatar. Nevertheless, the odds were not stacked in favour of him, the leader of the second-largest party. Dahal was using every trick in the book to cling to power, and extracting support from Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, his traditional adversary, was not quite in immediate sight. Some turns of events then proved to be a godsend for him. As Oli was working on his script for return to Baluwatar, some subtexts emerged. His own concerns amid being called out for some scandals and the internal churn in his party fuelled by former President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s possible return to active politics and the Deubas’ growing unease that skeletons would start tumbling out of their closet.In a calculated move, Congress President Deuba offered Oli the prime ministerial post on a silver platter. Oli hastily wove a subterfuge of constitutional amendments “to ensure political stability”. Now Oli and Deuba have made extricating the country out of the perpetual political instability their main agenda, in what looks paradoxical as they actually are largely the drivers of this instability. While the Dahal government was a failure on various fronts, the UML-Congress dispensation inspires little hope—a look at the faces in the Oli Cabinet speaks volumes.“Nationalist” Oli When Oli first became prime minister in 2015, the country was already on course to hold the first general elections in 2017 under the new constitution. He employed India’s border blockade following the promulgation of the constitution to mould his image into a nationalist leader. The UML-Maoist merger deal made him the most powerful prime minister in democratic Nepal after the elections. During his first stint in 2015-16, in response to the blockade, he turned to China and signed a slew of deals in Beijing, including on trade, transit and transport. Relations between Nepal and India had already hit the rock bottom. A communist dispensation given by the 2017 elections was clearly to the liking of China.In an attempt to consolidate his “nationalist” image, Oli, in his second stint, appeared bent on taking India head-on. In response to the publication of the political map by India showing Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura within its territory, Oli moved a constitutional amendment to put the triangular area within the Nepali territory. He even once used the parliamentary pulpit to state that India should replace its national emblem to “Singhameva Jayate” from “Satyameva Jayate”. Nepal-India relations soured further. But Oli’s misadventures on the domestic front cost him the job. His two House dissolutions were overturned by the Supreme Court.

The only difference is how the establishment of the day takes it to execution. Oli’s elevation for the top job this time comes on the heels of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s third consecutive term, albeit with a subdued mandate. Nevertheless, New Delhi’s foreign policy is unlikely to change, nor will there be any significant difference in the cloak-and-dagger moves.

But what's also true is that the problem in large part lies with Nepali political actors themselves who are perpetually in quest for New Delhi's blessings—when they are in power and when they are not. The tendency of Nepali politicians to look at things in a binary of New Delhi or Beijing is also the bane of Nepal. There clearly has been a lack of agency among Nepali leaders, and this, too, tends to play a part in inviting interference, seen in recent years from the north as well.With Oli back in power, some sections expect that Oli, in his old avatar, will rise up to India and speak up for Nepal. He should. But it's quite unlikely. Self-doubting Nepali politicians tend to be subservient and servile, and Oli is no exception even though he has displayed adventurism on a couple of occasions. Oli has worked hard to stage his comeback. After his overtures seeking to make peace with New Delhi in the past years were repeatedly cold-shouldered, he was running out of patience. Kept at an arm’s length by New Delhi, Oli was becoming more and more alienated. New Delhi remains suspicious about him, while on the domestic front there are worries he might attempt a re-run of his past adventures, even if to prove that his decision to dissolve the House was justified. Oli knows he must tread carefully. He is well aware that the temerarious acts in the cover of nationalism do not bode well for his own politics. Even though it was Oli who most vocally glorified the constitution, his commitment to it has been feeble. No one knows yet what lies behind Oli’s constitutional amendment ruse. He has just tossed the idea of constitutional amendments also with an ulterior intent of employing it to humour New Delhi. Yes, he is not a milquetoast like Dahal, but he is not also the same swashbuckling Oli from his second stint, or from eight-nine years ago for that matter. Nepalis have already seen the Deubas making a trip to Varanasi and Dahal to Ujjain. Next it could be Oli offering a puja at some other Indian temple. Who knows? ","summary":"Much has been said and written about CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal's fall and CPN-UML Chairperson KP Sharma Oli's rise to power over the past two weeks or so. That Oli would pull the rug out from under Dahal was almost certain in March itself when the two communist leaders plotted the Nepali Congress's ouster from the government—it was a matter of when, not if. Oli had been scheming all along to be back in Baluwatar. Nevertheless, the odds were not stacked in favour of him, the leader of the second-largest party. Dahal was using every trick in the book to cling to power, and extracting support from Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, his traditional adversary, was not quite in immediate sight. Some turns of events then proved to be a godsend for him. As Oli was working on his script for return to Baluwatar, some subtexts emerged. His own concerns amid being called out for some scandals and the internal churn in his party fuelled by former President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s possible return to active politics and the Deubas’ growing unease that skeletons would start tumbling out of their closet.In a calculated move, Congress President Deuba offered Oli the prime ministerial post on a silver platter. Oli hastily wove a subterfuge of constitutional amendments “to ensure political stability”. Now Oli and Deuba have made extricating the country out of the perpetual political instability their main agenda, in what looks paradoxical as they actually are largely the drivers of this instability. While the Dahal government was a failure on various fronts, the UML-Congress dispensation inspires little hope—a look at the faces in the Oli Cabinet speaks volumes.“Nationalist” Oli When Oli first became prime minister in 2015, the country was already on course to hold the first general elections in 2017 under the new constitution. He employed India’s border blockade following the promulgation of the constitution to mould his image into a nationalist leader. The UML-Maoist merger deal made him the most powerful prime minister in democratic Nepal after the elections. During his first stint in 2015-16, in response to the blockade, he turned to China and signed a slew of deals in Beijing, including on trade, transit and transport. Relations between Nepal and India had already hit the rock bottom. A communist dispensation given by the 2017 elections was clearly to the liking of China.In an attempt to consolidate his “nationalist” image, Oli, in his second stint, appeared bent on taking India head-on.

We have agreed to work together to protect national interests, control corruption, improve governance, expedite development activities, and ensure political stability, in accordance with the public desire.”The prime minister has made the details of the midnight deal public three weeks after it was signed by Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. Leaders from Congress and other parties were raising questions over keeping the deal secret for weeks.According to Oli, the seven points of the agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the midnight of July 1 are as follows:1. Form a national consensus government under Article 76(2) of the constitution, involving other political parties as well to protect national interests, control corruption, improve governance, accelerate the development activities, and ensure political stability.2. The national consensus government will prioritise reviewing the strengths, weaknesses, and complexities observed in the course of implementing the constitution, and will focus on amending the constitution and enacting related laws in order to ensure political stability.3. To end the prolonged economic slowdown, prepare a reliable business environment, and rejuvenate economic activities. This includes encouraging both domestic and foreign investments to create sufficient and dignified employment opportunities within the country.4. CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli will lead the national consensus government for the first two years and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba the election government until elections in November-December 2027.5. To prepare common minimum programmes to protect the national interest, to ensure good governance by ending corruption, to determine the basis of the national consensus government and to run the government on the same basis.6. The national consensus government will ensure equal participation of the two leading political parties, while also including other political parties in the government.7. Provincial governments will be formed as per the spirit and intent of the national consensus government, and efforts will be made to accelerate development activities at the provincial and local levels as per the public sentiment.

The situation had been more difficult due to India’s blockade. A few months into Oli’s tenure, the southern neighbour withdrew its blockade while the constitution was amended to address the concerns of the agitating communities. Though the Madhesh-based parties boycotted voting on the constitution amendment, it had partially addressed the concerns of the dissenting groups. His government also signed a historic Trade and Transit Agreement with China, ending Nepal’s sole dependence on India for third-country trade.Oli’s nationalist graph as prime minister for 10 months between October 2015 to August 2016 went up so high that his CPN-UML not only emerged the largest party from the 2017 election but was very close to the majority mark on its own. When Oli moved into Baluwatar for the second time in February 2018, he had an even stronger electoral mandate. After a merger with the CPN (Maoist Centre) two months later, the Nepal Communist Party that he jointly led with Pushpa Kamal Dahal enjoyed a near two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Oli’s prime ministership started with high hopes and excitement as he was leading a majority government for the first time in around two decades. As Oli was set to lead the government for a full five-year term, the hope was that decades of political instability would end, the constitution would be implemented and the federal system strengthened. The expectations, however, were short-lived. Oli started demonstrating his authoritarian streak right after taking charge as the executive head. He brought the National Intelligence Department, the Department of Revenue Investigation and the Department of Money Laundering under the purview of the Prime Minister’s Office.His intolerance for dissent became apparent when he banned protests at Maitighar, near Singha Durbar, the government’s seat. His government then prepared a slew of bills aiming to muzzle the media, curtail freedom of expression and shrink civic space. He had contested the elections by selling big dreams—railway connecting China, Nepal’s own ship in the high seas, and distribution of gas through pipelines, among other things. But none of these dreams even came close to fruition. Having realised he had failed to deliver as promised even two years after coming to power, he played another nationalist card—amending the constitution to show Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s map—which his predecessors never dared to do. While it has been registered as a historic move in the country, it antagonised New Delhi.Oli’s unilateral style of running government and leading the party forced Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal to ally against him, leading to a split in the Nepal Communist Party. After failing to keep the NCP united, Oli tried to dissolve the House—twice in under six months.His decision to trample on the constitution to stay in led to his humiliating exit from the government. He was ousted by the Supreme Court. Political analysts say Oli has a historic opportunity to right the previous wrongs. “The Congress-UML alliance has generated high hopes and provides an opportunity for Oli to correct his past mistakes,” Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, told the Post. “However, Oli’s recent statements [on House dissolution] show he is still not in the mood for course correction. He has no regrets about his wrongdoings.”Oli has repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House even until last month. The Congress-UML alliance stands on the foundation for stability. But how can the person who couldn’t give stability even when he commanded a majority government ensure stable government now, says Pyakurel. “Trust in the new government will be low as the parties have kept secret even the agreement that led to its formation,” he says.However, some analysts say it would not be easy for the incumbent not to deliver. “There is a strong voice within both the Congress and the UML that it is futile to form a government that cannot deliver. So the pressure to perform will come from both the ruling alliance as well as the opposition,” says Sanjeev Humagain, who teaches PhD students in politics and international relations at Tribhuvan University.“The Congress-UML coalition has the political capital needed to deliver. The bureaucracy too will find it difficult not to cooperate with the government of two major forces. I see a positive environment for delivery.” ","summary":"KP Sharma Oli becomes prime minister for the fourth time despite controversial previous terms marked by political instability, suppression of dissent, and failed promises, but now has an opportunity to rectify his mistakes with the Congress-UML alliance."},{"hash":"d5a7c9b073d6dcd9a5e167e3bc178d535259cfa7e98ffe2a0cf5550d90ac8e30","title":"tourism-earnings-hit-record-high","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/07/14/tourism-earnings-hit-record-high","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Screenshot%202024-07-14%20at%2007.14.19.png&w=900&height=601","date":1720915200000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"Nepal recorded its historic high income from tourism in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June, according to the latest data issued by Nepal Rastra Bank. Industry insiders attribute this to the appreciation of the US dollar.The central bank said that the country earned Rs76.55 billion from tourism in the review period, surpassing the record set in 2018-19 when the country had earned Rs75.37 billion from 1.2 million foreign tourists. (At that time, the exchange rate was $1=Rs112.9.)According to a central bank report, Nepal received 1.06 million tourists in the first 11 months.“The surge in tourism income is primarily a result of the exchange rate,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, former CEO of Nepal Tourism Board. Any adjustments in the exchange rate will prompt an appreciation or depreciation of the tourist’s currency, affecting transport costs and the tourist’s decisions to visit the country. “Thus, the exchange rate impacts the number of tourist visits and tourism receipts,” said Joshi.“Besides, the growth of international chain hotels and Nepal gradually switching to a digital payment system has also contributed to the growth in tourism income.”The tourism ministry’s statistics show that the average stay of tourists in Nepal is currently 13.2 days, while they spend $41 per day.Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson for the Nepal Rastra Bank, said the depreciated exchange rate positively relates to the tourism demand, as travel becomes less expensive when visiting a devalued country. “The currency factor, normally, forces tourists to select a destination before a trip. In this context, a country with a depreciation in domestic currency will attract international tourists,” said Bhatta. He said that while most of Nepal’s economic indicators have been underperforming, tourism has been doing exceptionally well.While Nepal’s economy is anticipated to grow by 3.87 percent in the current fiscal year, accommodation and food service, which are linked to tourism activities, are expected to see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among all 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy.“This shows how the tourism industry has been a boon for Nepal’s sluggish economic growth.”The digital payment system has also been making tourism income transparent. Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer of Fonepay, said Indian tourists have been spending Rs5 million a day since Nepal started the payment system through the quick response (QR) code on March 1.“Since the central bank has fully opened the digital retail payment gateway for Nepali operators with any other country, it will help bring more foreign currencies.”Through the budget, the government has announced that it will draw 1.6 million foreign visitors this year.According to industry insiders, the target is attainable, but there are a few challenges.From November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed for 10 hours daily, from 10 pm to 8 am, for five months until March 31, to expand the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season.Besides, industry insiders say the Nepal Tourism Board has been headless for the past four months, affecting all international promotional and marketing events.A number of reports, including the latest by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Nepal’s economic activity is expected to pick up, with growth reaching 4.9 percent in the next fiscal year 2024-25. This growth will be supported by an increase in tourist arrivals, boosting domestic demand. According to the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, in 2023, tourist arrivals crossed the million mark for the first time in four years.Foreign arrivals had crossed the one million mark for the first time in 2018 when the country received 1.17 million foreign visitors.The number reached 1.19 million in 2019. Then, the Covid pandemic started in early 2020, bringing arrivals to a standstill. Travel restrictions and an economic slowdown triggered by lockdowns delivered a massive blow to Nepal’s burgeoning tourism industry, decimating revenues and profits after 2020.Nepal received 230,085 and 150,962 tourists in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the number shot up to 614,869.Joshi said that by the end of 2024, Nepal may get 1.2 million tourists in the year. “A careful execution of plan and proper marketing, especially in China, could boost arrivals to 1.6 million,” said Joshi. “It will be justified to shift Kathmandu’s airport expansion from November to December, to let the peak season pass.”Dozens of luxury hotels have opened across the country so there are no problems with accommodation, he said. Nepal has been widening roads and building other infrastructure, like airports, which will help attract more tourists. However, industry insiders say the government’s neglect of air safety problems could hinder future growth, particularly in the high-end segment, where travellers consider the safety of any destination country while making travel plans.Most embassies have put Nepal’s air safety situation on their travel advisories. The European Commission imposed this list in 2013 after Nepali airlines failed to meet international safety standards. The government has wilfully ignored the call of the United Nations aviation watchdog, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to split Nepal’s civil aviation body into two entities: service provider and regulator. The separation is a crucial organisational reform agenda which has been a work in progress for the past one and a half decades. ","summary":"Nepal recorded its historic high income from tourism in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June, according to the latest data issued by Nepal Rastra Bank. Industry insiders attribute this to the appreciation of the US dollar.The central bank said that the country earned Rs76.55 billion from tourism in the review period, surpassing the record set in 2018-19 when the country had earned Rs75.37 billion from 1.2 million foreign tourists. (At that time, the exchange rate was $1=Rs112.9.)According to a central bank report, Nepal received 1.06 million tourists in the first 11 months.“The surge in tourism income is primarily a result of the exchange rate,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, former CEO of Nepal Tourism Board. Any adjustments in the exchange rate will prompt an appreciation or depreciation of the tourist’s currency, affecting transport costs and the tourist’s decisions to visit the country. “Thus, the exchange rate impacts the number of tourist visits and tourism receipts,” said Joshi.“Besides, the growth of international chain hotels and Nepal gradually switching to a digital payment system has also contributed to the growth in tourism income.”The tourism ministry’s statistics show that the average stay of tourists in Nepal is currently 13.2 days, while they spend $41 per day.Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson for the Nepal Rastra Bank, said the depreciated exchange rate positively relates to the tourism demand, as travel becomes less expensive when visiting a devalued country. “The currency factor, normally, forces tourists to select a destination before a trip.

The definition of the “Nepali nation”, however, was common to all personal convictions of every politician.In keeping with the spirit of the anticolonial movements of the 1950s, the nationalistic aim of BP was the production of national unity with the voluntary erasure of diversities within the country. When Bedanand Jha of the Terai Congress talked about the political dimension of Pahadi domination, BP pitted Madhav Regmi against him and succeeded in mobilising the Madheshis to defeat all Madheshi contenders in the electoral fray.

The long and short of the ideological examination is that the monarchists, the democrats, the Marxists and the Maoists subscribe to the same definition of Nepali nationality: The ethnonational supremacism of what has been constitutionally described as Khas-Arya community through the contested constitution of 2015. Due to the ethnonational solidarity around Nepalipan, perhaps a large section of the NC finds the control of Sharma Oli more comfortable than some of their own secular or somewhat less communal leaders.Alternative aspirationsThe Madheshis came to the streets in 2007 mainly because the Maoists and the mainstream parties had failed to address their aspirations of identity, representation and self-rule through the interim constitution. Divided between the territories under the control of Gorkhali expansionists and the East India Company (EIC) after the ratification of the treaty of Sugauli in 1816, the Madheshis continued to be a bewildered nation.

Some experts think this time may be different because the Nepali Congress isn't as strong as it used to be. If Oli tries to run the government without listening to the Nepali Congress, it could cause problems.","summary":"The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the country’s two largest political parties, have come together to form the government for the first time in almost a decade.Backed by the Congress, UML chair KP Sharma Oli staked his claim to the prime minister’s post within hours after President Ramchandra Paudel invited a member of the House of Representatives to show a majority in the lower house with the support of two or more parties by Sunday evening.Following the failure of Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the outgoing prime minister, to secure a majority in Friday’s floor test, President Paudel on Friday evening invited political parties to form a new government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution. Article 76 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal states that the President appoints as prime minister a member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with support from two or more parties. Soon after the President’s call, UML chief Oli presented the signatures of 165 lawmakers (including 88 from the Congress and 77 from the UML) to show the House’s majority in his favour.Oli will be appointed the new prime minister by Sunday evening as no other leader from any party in Parliament can produce a majority.And with that, the Congress and the UML have now entered a new phase of collaboration. As per the deal, the two parties will head the government on a rotational basis for the remaining term of Parliament.Leaders from both parties say that they decided to join hands with specific goals, mainly of ensuring political stability, reviewing and amending the constitution, and giving an impetus to the country’s sluggish economy.The two major political rivals have jointly run the country on some occasions in the past, for at least half a dozen times. The latest instance was in the Sushil Koirala government in February 2014 formed after the second Constituent Assembly election. The Congress-UML administration was formed with the key mandate of promulgating the constitution, which they successfully did in September 2015.The two parties first collaborated to run a government in the Krishna Prasad Bhattarai-led government in 1990. The key mandate of that government was to promulgate the constitution and hold first the parliamentary elections after the reinstatement of multiparty democracy that year.After that, they ran a coalition government in 1996, led by Girija Prasad Koirala. That government was formed to hold general elections amid a challenging time as the erstwhile CPN (Maoist) had just launched an insurgency. The two parties also collaborated in the Koirala government formed after the Second People’s Movement in 2006 that produced the Interim Constitution in 2007. In the first Constituent Assembly, too, the Congress and the UML shared power. This was the first time the Congress was in a government led by a UML leader. In 2009, the then second-largest party Congress had supported UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, who now chairs the CPN (Unified Socialist), as prime minister after the fall of the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government. The UML was the third-largest party at the time.There were collaborations between the Congress and the UML on other occasions as well but that was with splinter factions such as the Nepali Congress (Democratic) led by Sher Bahadur Deuba.Despite their long experience of working together, the two parties’ collaboration may not be a smooth sailing this time around, political observers say.They argue that UML leaders and party committees may follow the decisions made by Oli as other leaders are less likely to challenge his decisions. But in the Congress, there are a number of factions, due to which the cooperation of the Congress-UML coalition may face challenges. “The UML is a party which works in a centralised system in which no one challenges the final say of their chief Oli, whereas in the Congress, though Deuba prevails most of the time, he is often challenged by other leaders,” Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political analyst told the Post. “When two parties have different orientations and working styles, they are bound to have challenges in running the government.”Pradip Paudel, a Congress leader, said if the party president comes up with a valid agenda that benefits the general public and the country, all Congress leaders cooperate with him. “It's true that we oppose the decisions that are not in favour of the country and its public,” Paudel told the Post. But it's not true that two big parties cannot cooperate with each other, Paudel argued. “Despite the differences in schooling and working styles, we have instances of the two parties delivering when they had a specific mandate,” he said.In 1990 and 2014, the two parties forged coalitions to promulgate the constitution, which they did. “The number of spoilers in those days was fewer than what it is today,” Bhatta added. “The collaboration may go smoothly for a few months after government formation, but they will have issues later given that these two parties are competitors in national politics.” But another political analyst CK Lal has a different opinion. Lal said that the Congress opted to cooperate with UML due to its diminishing confidence. Until the Congress regains its lost confidence, this coalition government won’t face a major problem, Lal added.In the 2022 elections, despite the Congress securing the highest number of seats in the federal parliament, the UML received the highest number of votes in the proportional representation category.“Being the largest party in the lower house of Parliament, the Congress seems to have acknowledged that the UML is the largest political force in the country, and that is the reason the Congress became ready to accept the UML’s leadership,” Lal told the Post. “Besides, the Congress possibly accepted the UML’s leadership to ensure they don’t tie up with the Maoist Centre next election.”Many leaders from the two parties argue that strengthening democracy can be a common reason for the two parties banding together. The two parties may be competitors but they fought together at least twice against the monarchy to restore democracy. But analysts say these two parties, which are eyeing better performance in the next general election, might not pursue a long-term cooperation.Congress leader Paudel said that the future of their alliance with the UML might be in question only if Oli tries to run the government unilaterally. “Until the party leading the government respects the senior coalition partner, I don’t think there will be any problem in the government’s continuation,” Paudel added.Until July 1, leaders of these two arch-rival forces were engaged in accusing each other of involvement in huge corruption scams. Congress leaders accused UML leaders’ hand in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land swap scam while the UML pointed to Congress leaders’ role in the Bhutanese refugees scam.Prithvi Subba Gurung, a UML deputy general secretary, said that partnership in the government “does not necessarily mean we cannot question the other for the mistakes we believe the other party has committed.”“This coalition is for political stability in the country,” Gurung told the Post. “But it does not mean that leaders from both parties should be barred from pointing out each other’s mistakes.” "},{"hash":"69daba61b473f841b716266524a435ac3f798fcf51f9af60f0c5a2a02dbdf79f","title":"jajarkot-earthquake-survivors-are-battling-monsoon-in-temporary-shelters","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/07/16/jajarkot-earthquake-survivors-are-battling-monsoon-in-temporary-shelters","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb23-1721094344.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1721088000000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"Nandaram Mahar’s family of seven haven’t had a good night’s sleep for the past month or so. The family is currently living at a temporary shelter in Nalgad Municipality-4 of Jajarkot district. What was already an arduous stay got worse after the start of the monsoon—the temporary hut struggles to keep out even normal rain if it continues for some hours, Mahar says. And when it rains, the food grains and clothes get wet.Mahar’s family relocated to the hut after the November 3 earthquake damaged their home. So moving back to the home is not an option, Mahar says. “The earthquake has weakened the land around the village, so the fear of landslides keeps us awake at night,” he says. “Now that it has started raining heavily, we have no option but to stay awake all night.”Mahar’s is not the only family that has had to battle monsoon with very few resources. The government has identified a total of 48,517 families in need of rehabilitation in the 6.4 magnitude earthquake. As many as 34,954 temporary shelters have been constructed so far. The rest of the families are forced to stay either in the flimsy tarpaulin tents or staying in the old house damaged by the quake.Chief District Officer of Jajarkot Umakant Adhikari said that since June, the details of 24,557 families have been included in the disaster management protocol. According to him, after releasing the second tranche of the housing reconstruction aid to build temporary huts, the amount is being distributed through the respective ward offices.Similarly, the second tranche has been released to 16,000 earthquake displaced families in Rukum West. Chief District Officer of Rukum West Hari Prasad Pant said that Rs400 million was sent to the local level account as second instalment for the construction of temporary housing. According to him, 32,006 beneficiaries have been recorded throughout the district. He informed that an additional budget has been requested from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority to provide funds to the rest.The earthquake victims complain that they are hugely affected by the monsoon rains. Lal Bahadur Mahar of Bheri Municipality-1 said that the clothes and food that gets wet when it rains have to be brought outside and dried when the sun shines. According to him, some families of the village risked their lives as they returned to the cracked houses. “The roof is constantly leaking,” he said. “It is very difficult to live here.”Many earthquake victims are taken ill in several settlements of earthquake affected districts of Jajarkot, Rukum West and Salyan. Children, senior citizens and patients of chronic diseases are the hardest hit. “Due to the intense heat and rain, the victims of the earthquake began to fall ill rapidly,” said Dr Priya Shahi of Basic Hospital in Chhedagadh. According to him, 50 to 100 patients come to the hospital daily for treatment of diarrhoea, fever, typhoid and pneumonia. He informed that almost 60 percent of those who come to the hospital are children.As per the record available at the district hospital in Jajarkot, around 150 people visit the health facility on a daily basis.The earthquake displaced people are exposed to monsoon-induced disasters. At present, most of the earthquake victims have built temporary housing near forests, riverbanks, edges of their farmland and on steep land. “Many of the quake-displaced families are at high risk of floods and landslides,” said Nar Bahadur Nepali, general secretary of Nepal Red Cross Society in Karnali Province. “The quake victims faced health problems during the cold winter and hot summer days. Now they are left at the risk of floods and landslides.”According to geologist Chandan Giri, there is a high risk of landslides in the areas affected by the earthquake. He said the risk of landslides is almost 80 percent higher after an earthquake than in other normal situations. After the earthquake, a team of five technicians led by him studied some villages in Nalgad, Bheri municipalities and Barekot Rural Municipality of Jajarkot and found that the land around various settlements was torn. “There is a risk of erosion and large landslides in those cracked areas,” he said, warning about the huge loss of lives and properties.The local people complained that the authorities concerned are indifferent about their hardships. However, Rabilal Sharma, secretary of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Law of Karnali Province, said that they have started preparation after studying the risk of landslides in the earthquake-affected settlements. According to him, all security mechanisms have been readied to minimise possible risks.16 families displaced due to the risk of landslidesAs the risk of landslides is looming large, 16 families of Chaupani in Bheri Municipality-1 have been displaced. The ward office has transferred 11 families to a nearby school, four families have moved to India while one family is taking shelter in a relative’s house, according to Deepak Rana, ward chair of Bheri Municipality-1.The district administration claims that it has carried out necessary initiatives to protect the quake-displaced people from the water-induced disasters. Adhikari, the Jajarkot CDO, said that a police team under the command of Assistant Sub-Inspector of Nepal Police has been mobilised to identify the families who are at high risk. “The families at risk are being searched and shifted to safer locations timely,” he added. ","summary":"Nandaram Mahar’s family of seven haven’t had a good night’s sleep for the past month or so. The family is currently living at a temporary shelter in Nalgad Municipality-4 of Jajarkot district. What was already an arduous stay got worse after the start of the monsoon—the temporary hut struggles to keep out even normal rain if it continues for some hours, Mahar says. And when it rains, the food grains and clothes get wet.Mahar’s family relocated to the hut after the November 3 earthquake damaged their home.

He is scheduled to seek a vote of confidence in the House on Sunday.Thapa said that they have “doubts” and “suspicions” over whether Oli will hand over the premiership to his party as per the agreement reached between the prime minister and the Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba. Ahead of government formation, Oli and Deuba signed a seven-point deal on July 1 outlining the power-sharing agreement between the two largest parties. Under this, Oli will lead the government for the first two years and Deuba will become the prime minister for the remaining time—until the holding of the general elections in 2027.Sharma said that the Congress should not remain silent on the issues and controversies surrounding Oli. The UML chairman was dragged into the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu land scam in particular, an issue the Congress strongly raised in Parliament while the UML was in the government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Now in the Oli government, many have voiced concerns whether the largest party will continue to raise the issue of Giri Bandhu land scam.Both general secretaries were not involved in the negotiations when Oli and Deuba assigned their close aides to work out their partnership in government. “So they are venting their ire and frustration,” a leader close to Deuba said. “Both Deuba and Oli are determined and committed to implementing the agreement they signed.”Thapa said the Congress rank and file harbours suspicions whether Oli will hand over the power to Deuba. Addressing a function in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, who took the news of the Congress and the UML agreeing to form a coalition as a surprise, said what the general people will get from the government of the two largest parties is more important than the political stability they have promised.Political stability should deliver gains in the economy and good governance, he argued. Tired of frequent changes in government, the two parties had agreed not to change the government until 2027. In the first phase, Oli is agreed to be the prime minister for two years. Deuba will then govern for the remaining time of the House. “But we doubt whether this agreement will be respected,” said Thapa.Oli’s past, his nature and attitude give room for this kind of suspicion but the prime minister knows very well that this is the last time for the Congress and the UML to correct the political course, Thapa argued. “Oli has appointed good experts as advisers so we are confident he is serious this time about delivery.”Pointing to Dahal, the CPN (Maoist Centre) leader with 32 seats in the House, who ran the government for one and a half years riding the backs of the UML and the Congress alternatively, Thapa said the current political situation had resulted from the betrayal by the senior party leaders against each other. “They deceived and lied to each other 15 to 16 times in the past.”The level of mistrust and perceived deceit was so high that the two parties came together to oust Dahal, Thapa said. “The prime minister should make the seven-point deal public. The government should dispel suspicions and both parties should be committed to the agreement,” he added.The parliamentary parties of the Congress and the UML have already endorsed the seven-point deal and vowed to implement it though the content of the agreement has not been made public.General Secretary Sharma said the two-party deal should shield no leader from corruption and irregularities.The Congress will not remain silent on the issues it raised against Oli in the past, Sharma said at a function in Kathmandu on Saturday. “We will work to make the Oli government successful but we will not remain quiet in his weakness.”Both Oli and Sharma are elected representatives from Jhapa district, where the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate is located.“We will extend all possible support to the Oli government to make it successful. We will give the vote of trust too but that does not mean we will close our eyes when a controversy related to Oli surfaces,” said Sharma. ","summary":"Barely a week after the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML came together to form a new government, two general secretaries of the Congress—Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma—made chilling remarks on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, the UML leader, on Saturday.With the backing of Congress, the single largest party in the House of Representatives, Oli was sworn in for his third prime ministerial stint on Monday. He is scheduled to seek a vote of confidence in the House on Sunday.Thapa said that they have “doubts” and “suspicions” over whether Oli will hand over the premiership to his party as per the agreement reached between the prime minister and the Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba. Ahead of government formation, Oli and Deuba signed a seven-point deal on July 1 outlining the power-sharing agreement between the two largest parties. Under this, Oli will lead the government for the first two years and Deuba will become the prime minister for the remaining time—until the holding of the general elections in 2027.Sharma said that the Congress should not remain silent on the issues and controversies surrounding Oli. The UML chairman was dragged into the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu land scam in particular, an issue the Congress strongly raised in Parliament while the UML was in the government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Now in the Oli government, many have voiced concerns whether the largest party will continue to raise the issue of Giri Bandhu land scam.Both general secretaries were not involved in the negotiations when Oli and Deuba assigned their close aides to work out their partnership in government. “So they are venting their ire and frustration,” a leader close to Deuba said. “Both Deuba and Oli are determined and committed to implementing the agreement they signed.”Thapa said the Congress rank and file harbours suspicions whether Oli will hand over the power to Deuba.

Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks.

Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.

The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.

The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.

Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu.

Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Changes in rainfall pattern, extreme weather incidents, and the proliferation of pests have been directly hitting crop production and threatening food security.The course she is pursuing offers little knowledge about climate change, but a two-day training she attended recently was of some help.“While studying the 10-month course, I learned new things, and practical know-how on crop plantation and harvest,” Bohora said. “The training I received on climate change was more useful.” It taught them how to adapt farming techniques to the changing climate.According to a new survey report, climate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity.The findings of the National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, were recently released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. The report paints a bleak picture of Nepal's climate situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, economic losses on and off-farm in the past five years, as reported by households, amounted to Rs415.44 billion. This does not include significant infrastructural damages.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain (68.7 percent), hill (50.3 percent), and Tarai (46.3 percent) regions also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases.Agriculture is the mainstay of Nepal’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half the population. The sector is heavily dependent on rainfall.For Susmita Thapa, a grade 12 student at Satyabadi Secondary School, receiving training on climate change has been an eye opener.“We learned the inter-relation between agriculture and climate change,” said Thapa. “Our formal classes do not teach about climate change, its impact, and the ways to tackle it.” Training participants said they have learned how to tackle climate change's impact on crops. Thapa also was informed on various climate adaptation measures. “The learning will be beneficial.”Amid the growing impact of climate change on agriculture in recent years, farmers in Bajhang have been informed on the challenges and ways to tackle the emerging problem.They have been acquainted with sustainable farming systems to boost output.The training was supported by the Biodiversity (Jal-jangal) program of the USAID, Social Development Center, a local organisation.“We stopped sowing local seeds after their yield declined. Now I know why this was happening,” said Birkha Mijar, a farmer in Thalara rural municipality Ward 9. “We knew what local seeds meant for sustainable farming. We also know the way to sow them. I will apply what I learned in the field.”Kubendra Rokaya, an instructor, said he has trained 600 students and farmers in the district on mitigating the impacts of climate change on agriculture.“Farmers in the far-western Nepal are unhappy as commercial farming is not very profitable. On top of that, climate distress has been a headache for farmers,” Rokaya said. “We can tackle the impacts of climate change by using local resources and technology. But many farmers are unaware of this.” The training has taught them new practices.“We have informed them on the impact of climate change at the local level, use of weather information, pest management, seed selection and early warning system,” Rokaya said.Amit Banmala, coordinator of the Social Development Center Project, said students pursuing agriculture science and agriculture JTAs are Nepal's future guides to farming. Many of them are engaged in agriculture.The agriculture sector in Bajhang faces drought in the winter and excessive rainfall in the rainy season.According to the Agriculture Knowledge Centre, droughts last year reduced winter produce by 20 percent. “Landslides and floods compound the problem in the agriculture sector every year,” said Tek Bahadur Bista, the centre’s chief.“Farmers are facing additional trouble.

The last fiscal year, which ended on July 15, saw the capital expenditure of Rs191.73 billion of the Rs302 billion allocation. This translates to spending only 63.47 percent.In the last four years, the average capital expenditure has remained at 60 percent, which demonstrates how slowly development is happening. Due to low spending, the economy has slowed down, forcing millions of Nepalis to seek their fortune abroad as the country is not generating enough jobs.Economist Chandramani Adhikari said the problem begins right from the start.“The budget is announced without preparation. The process of selecting the projects is haphazard. Then, the budget is allocated for those projects without assuring the financial source,” he said.“There are no proper designs, detailed project reports and environmental impact assessment.” The projects that are outside the procurement plan or annual plan are included in the budget.“Then, there is a lack of coordination among the government bodies while implementing projects. The result is time and cost overruns,” Adhikari said.In 2020, the killer Covid pandemic shook the world, without sparing Nepal. The viral disease prompted several lockdowns, and projects were halted for a long time. Post-Covid, the demand for critical projects like health, roads and other infrastructures increased, providing hope that the economy would mobilise massive capital and generate jobs.The outcome was pessimistic. The government has not been able to spend more than 60 percent of the capital allocation.The report of the Financial Comptroller General Office shows that capital expenditures, which were an average of 70 percent during the pre-Covid period, deteriorated to an average of 60 percent during the post-Covid period. According to the report, capital expenditure was at 63.47 percent in the last fiscal year, which marginally recovered from 61.44 percent in the previous fiscal year, 2022-23.It was 57.23 percent in the fiscal year 2021-22 and 64.6 percent in 2020-21. During the peak Covid period, the capital expenditure was at 46.34 percent.Before Covid-19, the capital expenditure was 76.93 percent in 2018-19. In 2017-18, it increased to 80.77 percent, from 66.92 percent in 2016-17 and 59.01 percent in 2015-16.Some experts say there is a monopoly of a few contractors who win bids on most critical projects. They do not start work on time after getting a 20 percent initial payment. “It’s obvious that the Nepali contractors lack financial, technical, and institutional capacity, including labour,” said Adhikari. The delay means projects become costly. Adhikari said that most of the projects' costs have gone up by more than six times. “We lack accountability, and no one is responsible for increased costs.”The Public Expenditure Review Commission of the finance ministry, led by economist Dilli Raj Khanal, in a report submitted to the ministry in January 2018, pointed out several flaws like implementing projects without proper planning and preparations, disregarding government standards, and inappropriately prioritising projects as the primary reasons for the delays in the completion of development projects and poor utilisation of capital expenditure.The country’s private sector is attempting to inject capital into the economy, but the government still plays a lead role in investing in infrastructure and public utility goods. Slow and inadequate capital expenses impede development activities. Analysts say this not only hampers job creation but also affects people’s incomes.Furthermore, last-hour exhaustion of the capital budget also leads to poor-quality construction work. Short-lived roads, bridges, and other infrastructure waste the state’s resources and put people's lives at risk.Capital expense is also considered the primary source of liquidity in the banks.An official at the Financial Comptroller General Office said the decline in capital expenditures after Covid-19 was due to a slowdown in the economy. Various other factors result in poor spending. Government officials said that sometimes, the budget allocated to one multipurpose project is not spent in the first year and is transferred to another project.

This is a big problem.” "},{"hash":"3fc34934e49ad4e5d818f6c3f80a5b726e53b3cc70b3fb2c7bea18057183cd30","title":"usaid-claims-better-than-expected-results-in-sectors-of-support-in-nepal","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/07/19/usaid-claims-better-than-expected-results-in-sectors-of-support-in-nepal","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Untitled5-1721354022.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1721347200000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"The US Agency for International Development says its support of the economic sector, particularly in agriculture, has yielded better-than-expected results in Nepal, with output boosted by 139 percent.USAID on Thursday held an interaction in Kathmandu to explore the depth of the Nepal-US partnership and review the achievements.Officials said that among the five major sectors USAID supports—including health, education, democracy and governance, economic growth and environment, and resilience—the farmers and small enterprises sector achieved better-than-expected results.The USAID said $62 million in sales of agricultural products was recorded in the projects it supported.The USAID's economic growth activities aim to improve the income-generating potential of the poorest of the poor, expand young people's access to jobs, and increase farmers' incomes and food security.The economic department of USAID works in the irrigation and agriculture sectors.

Type-3 polio virus, which is vaccine-derived, has been detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers [in Kathmandu] on May 26.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease has surfaced in the capital city’s sewage, which is a serious problem, according to public health officials.They said that the presence of poliovirus in sewage samples indicates the looming risk of an outbreak.Officials at the WHO, however, said there is no need to worry as no one has been found infected with the virus in the country since 2010.“There is no need to panic, as the virus has been detected only in sewage samples,” said Dr Balbindra Singh, the WHO representative. “Health agencies are taking every precaution to prevent the disease outbreak.”Officials at the National Public Health Laboratory, the agency that carries out environmental surveillance of poliovirus, said that it took two weeks to process sewage samples. The samples were then sent to the UN agency’s reference laboratory in Thailand for cell culture, as the service is available only in a few laboratories across the world.The national laboratory collects samples from five tributaries in the Kathmandu Valley and from Koshi, Madhesh, and Gandaki provinces to check for the presence of the polio virus. Following the confirmation of the virus in the sewage, health authorities scrambled to arrange a budget to launch a special vaccination drive in three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Officials informed that the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the WHO agreed to provide vaccines and other costs of the campaign, respectively.“We are launching a four-day polio vaccination campaign in all three districts of Valley from July 24 to 27,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division. “All children under five years of age will be inoculated with an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in the drive.”An estimated 300,000 children live in three districts of the Valley. Oral polio vaccine, which consists of Type-1 and Type-3 polio virus, will be administered during the campaign, following the detection of Type-3 virus in sewage samples. Officials said health workers and female community health volunteers will be mobilised in houses, schools, bus parks, and entry points to ensure that no eligible children miss the vaccine. “We have also stepped up surveillance measures that include collecting sewage samples every week, which we used to collect every fortnight, and taking stool samples of the children having paralysis for testing,” said Gautam. “We have sent some samples to Thailand for testing, and the result is pending.”Doctors say the polio virus mainly affects children and is usually transmitted through droplets or aerosols from the throat and by faecal contamination of hands, utensils, food and water. Those who do not wash their hands properly, and those who consume contaminated food and water or reside in an area where water and sanitation conditions are poor are at high risk of getting infected with the virus.The Health Ministry said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country.Childhood immunisation is the government’s number one priority, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate.

Most patients of cervical cancer in Nepal—80.9 percent—are diagnosed at a late stage, contributing to the higher mortality rate.Health officials agreed that it would be best to prevent cancer from occurring, which can only be done with the help of free screening, awareness drives and administration of the vaccine against human papillomavirus.“Symptoms of cervical cancer can be detected 10 to 12 years before, through screening,” said Dahal. \"But most patients seek treatment in the third or fourth stages of cancer, when their condition already gets complicated.”According to Dahal, free screening will be carried out in the local units of Sarlahi, Mahottari, Rautahat, Palpa, Dolakha, Kaski, Surkhet, Kailali, Sindhupalchok, Kavrepalanchok and Lalitpur districts in the current fiscal year that started this week. The budget for free screening can purchase around 130,000 test kits, which means only that number of women can be screened, said Dahal.Oncologists say early treatment can prevent up to 80 percent of cervical cancer cases.“Survival rate of cervical cancer is up to 95 percent if the treatment is started in stage 1 and up to 75 percent in stage 2,” said Dr Shivaji Poudel, executive director at the Chitwan-based BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital. “The important thing is that problems must be diagnosed at an early stage and treatment started.”Experts say awareness and free screening, along with the administration of vaccines against human papillomavirus, could help lessen the burden of cervical cancer in Nepal. If the problem is diagnosed early, the ailment can be cured at a small cost, they add.Health officials complained that the budget was not sufficient to carry out nationwide vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV), which they planned to start in the first quarter of 2025. They say that the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has agreed to provide vaccine doses enough for 1.7 million girls between 10 and 14.Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact. The virus causes cervical cancer, which is the second-most common cancer in the developing world. Hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in Nepal.Doctors say most cervical cancers are associated with the HPV, a sexually transmitted infection. Widespread immunisation could reduce the impact of cervical cancer and other cancers caused by the HPV worldwide.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced HPV vaccines nationally while India and Indonesia have introduced them in some districts.Last year, Nepal purchased 20,000 doses of the HPV vaccine, which were administered to around 9,000 girls aged between 14 and 15 years from all seven provinces. Health authorities administered the vaccines at schools after other measures failed to increase the vaccine’s uptake.The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.Nepal is also among the countries that have committed to eliminating cervical cancer by 2030. For that, the country has to meet 90-70-90 targets, which means vaccinating 90 percent of the girls with the HPV vaccine by the age 15, performing screening on 70 percent of women using a high-performance test by the age 35 and again by 45 years and provide treatment to 90 percent of women who are pre-cancer tested and manage 90 percent of the women with invasive cancer.

Provincial and local government agencies have been requested to coordinate with private schools and other stakeholders to implement the programme.”Anaemia is a condition in which blood produces low levels of haemoglobin or healthy red blood cells. Iron and other nutritional deficiencies, malaria, hookworm infection, chronic infections, and genetic conditions, including sickle cell diseases, are among the causes for anaemia. Studies show that 39 percent of girls aged 10 and 19 years and 21 percent of boys of the same age group suffer from anaemia in Nepal. Health authorities however, have been preparing the supplement administration programme only for girls.Health officials said that they have also been considering providing the supplement tablets to boys as well, as several countries have already started administering iron-folic acid to boys.Doctors say anaemia in adults can cause fatigue, lethargy, reduced physical productivity, and poor work performance. It is a major concern among pregnant women, as problems can lead to increased maternal mortality rates and poor birth outcomes.The Health Ministry has been providing the supplement at government schools across the country since 2016. Some local levels had already been administering the supplement tablets in private schools.Thapa said that all schools, whether government or private, will implement the supplementation programme from the new fiscal year. Under the programme, eligible girls will be administered a supplement tablet every week for three months. They will be administered the tablet again after three months and continued for 13 weeks. Thapa said that 26 supplement tablets will be administered per person in a year.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 conducted by the ministry shows that 43 percent of the children aged between six to 59 months have been found to be anaemic—25 percent mildly anaemic, 18 percent moderately anaemic and one percent severely anaemic.The prevalence of anaemia in children aged between six to 59 months has decreased from 53 percent in 2016 to 43 percent in 2022. However, the trend has not been consistently downward. In 2006, around 48 percent of children were found to be anaemic. Prevalence of anaemia in the above-mentioned age group was found to be high—50.6 percent in the Madhesh Province, followed by 48.9 percent in Lumbini, 45.4 percent in Sudurpaschim, 42.5 percent in Bagmati, 39.8 percent in Karnali, 33.9 percent in Koshi and 30.7 percent in Gandaki Province.Women living in the Tarai region are more likely to be anaemic (45 percent) than those living in the hills (20 percent) and in the mountainous regions (23 percent), the survey showed. More than half the women (52 percent) are anaemic in the Madhesh Province.In the 1990s, 75 percent of pregnant women in Nepal were found to be suffering from anaemia.Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of foetal growth retardation and low birth weight, premature delivery, increased perinatal mortality, and reduced resistance to infection for both mother and baby. Thapa said anaemia is a serious concern for children as it can impair their cognitive development and can have long-term health and economic implications for society.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. ","summary":"Potato, a staple food of hundreds of thousands of people, especially those residing in the mountainous regions, is among the most widely consumed and versatile crops in Nepal. The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees.

Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. ","summary":"We spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley "},{"hash":"c077b34beda2250a997231f215f178053a057340c5c72de0aec15b25ae40ddb7","title":"old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/11/18/old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2023/third-party/phidim%20main%20(1).JPG&w=900&height=601","date":1700265600000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

But after the Asian Cricket Council expanded the tournament, Nepal made their way into the main event as one of the two semi-finals, with the other being Thailand.And, now, they have created history.The UAE came at the tournament as Premier Cup champions and narrowly missed out on the 2024 Women’s T20 World Cup and were a favoured side in the tournament opener. They gave Nepal a brief scare when Kavisha Egodage (3-12) found the breakthrough wicket of Khadka’s opening partner Sita Rana Magar for seven in the 5.1 overs, removed Kabita Kunwar for two in the 7.1 overs and a dangerous Rubina Chhetri for 10 in the 13.3 overs. In between, Lavanya Keny dismissed Nepal skipper Indu Barma for six, which had temporarily slackened Nepal’s chase.But Khadka, who was opening the batting for the first time after 16 T20Is, held firm at the other end, soaking up all the pressure and taking full responsibility. She raced to fifty off just 35 balls and continued to cast her magic with patience and confidence before wrapping up the victory with an impressive four off UAE captain Esha Oza, leading Nepal to 118-4 in 16.1 overs.Khadka’s 72 runs was also the highest score by a Nepali batter in the Women’s Asia Cup. In the process, Khadka also became the first Nepali cricketer to score a half-century at the Women’s Asia Cup.Jyoti Pandey’s 16 against Sri Lanka in the 2016 Asia Cup was the previous best score for Nepal.Khadka’s 45-ball 72 is also the third highest score by a Nepali batter in Women’s T20I. Chhetri’s unbeaten 118 against Maldives in Bangi, Malaysia in February during the Women’s Premier Cup and Rana Magar’s unconquered 82 against Qatar during their T20I bilateral series in Doha in November 2021 stand as the first and second highest score by a woman cricketer for Nepal. \"I am very happy that I had the opportunity to make the country proud. I would like to thank everybody,\" player of the match Khadka said after the win.Earlier, Barma starred with the ball with three wickets and a run out helping Nepal restrict the UAE to 115-8 after sending the opponents to bat first.Nepal put the UAE on the back foot, with their captain Oza getting run out after making 10 in the second over and seamer Sabnam Rai bowling out Rinitha Rajith in the fourth over.However, once spinners Chhetri, Barma and Kabita Joshi were introduced, Nepal were more vicious.Barma dismissed Theertha Satish for nine in the sixth over and Samaira Dharnidharka for 13 in the eight, leaving the UAE at 46-4.Egodage’s 22 off 26, which featured two fours, and Khushi Sharma’s 36 off 39, that also included two boundaries, revived the UAE innings after the powerplay but Kritika Marasini undid Egodage in the 14.1 overs. Barma then worked with Kunwar to run out Heena Hotchandani for nine in 18.1 overs before having Sharma caught by Marasini two balls later. Vaishnave Mahesh departed next (run out) as the UAE lost three wickets for just six runs at the back end and were able to put up a below-par total.“It's a great win and we are very happy. It was our coach and captain's decision to make Samjhana open. We believe she can do well opening the batting. I am very happy with my team. They kept believing and I am very, very happy,” skipper Barma said.UAE captain Oza lamented that their team could not exploit a good wicket.“It was a pretty decent wicket and we didn't post a par total. Everybody got a good start but we couldn't convert, and losing three wickets in the powerplay isn't an ideal start. At times we were bowling too short. There were too many bad balls.Nepal play their second group match against Pakistan on Sunday, before facing defending champions and tournament favourites India on Tuesday.

Nepal were chasing 121.India have won seven out of eight editions of the Asia Cup since its inauguration in 2004. Bangladesh won 2018 edition defeating India by three wickets.Rubina Chhetri, who is now Nepal’s most capped women’s cricketer with 55 appearances in the national team, and Sita Rana Magar were both in Nepal’s squad in 2016.But Rana Magar hopes Nepal women’s team will be a lot better this time as they have also drawn inspiration from the men's team who recently participated in the T20 World Cup.“Our plan is not just to participate in the tournament. We have a feeling that our team can play a good game against big teams like our men’s team,” said Rana Magar.“We have gained clarity on how to bat for a full 20 overs and how to bowl the ball through mentoring.

Chhetri is also the first Nepali player to score a century in women’s T20Is.Chhetri, who scored 17 (17), 28 (43) and 37 (26) in three warm-up matches against Sri Lanka, will form the core of Nepal’s batting unit alongside Barma and Rana Magar.Pacer Kabita Joshi also impressed with the ball in the warm-up, while Sabnam Rai and Kritika Marasini will lead the spin threat for Nepal.

But the lower court reinstated it last month, sparking the protests and an ensuing clampdown that included an internet shutdown and a curfew with the army on the streets.The recent clashes followed similar violent protests ahead of January’s national elections by Hasina’s opponents in response to what they called her authoritarian rule, and by garment workers demanding better pay amid high inflation.“Students have clearly said they are in no way part of the violence and arson that have taken place in Bangladesh since Monday,” Amin Uddin said.“I am hoping normalcy will return after today’s ruling and people with ulterior motives will stop instigating people,” he added.Internet and text message services in Bangladesh have been suspended since Thursday, as security forces cracked down on protesters who defied a ban on public gatherings.At least four protest coordinators told BBC Bangla that they planned to continue their action until they secured the release of some detained student leaders and the restoration of internet and other cellular services.“The judgment of the Supreme Court seems unclear to us. There is no clear-cut solution for all types of quotas,” said Abdul Quader, one of the coordinators.Soldiers have been patrolling the largely deserted streets of the capital Dhaka since the government ordered a curfew late on Friday.

But critics also accuse her of authoritarianism, human rights violations, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent, charges her party denies.The Supreme Court directed the government to cut the job quotas for families of independence fighters to 5% from 30%, the attorney general said. The remaining 2% of jobs still subject to quotas are for people from so-called backward groups and the disabled, he added.There was no immediate reaction from groups affected by reduced quotas following Sunday’s verdict.

Among them, 60 are in the high-risk category, it said, and isolation wards have been set up at health institutions to treat patients.Family members of the affected patient were kept at a local hospital for observation after a case of Nipah virus was confirmed in Malappuram, a town about 350 km (220 miles) from Kerala’s capital Thiruvananthapuram, local media reports said. Other people who might be at risk were asked to isolate at home.The state government said it is working to trace any affected people to contain the spread of the virus.

Vance. It will be their first campaign event together as the now official Republican presidential ticket.Republican Party officials said during Trump’s nominating convention in Milwaukee this week that his brush with death last Saturday had changed him, and that when he made his acceptance speech on Thursday night he would call for national unity.While Trump began the address with a call for unity and national healing, much of his speech was his well-known list of grievances and attacks on opponents.It is unclear what type of speech Trump will deliver on Saturday, but his diehard supporters typically flock to such events to hear Trump’s more traditional inflammatory rhetoric.Trump and Vance will take the stage in Grand Rapids with the Republican Party unified behind them after this week’s nominating convention. In contrast, the Democrats are in turmoil and it is no longer certain that President Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in the November 5 election.Biden is facing mounting calls from many elected officials in his own party to step aside as the party’s White House candidate and to end his re-election bid, after his poor debate performance against Trump last month.Biden is trailing in opinion polls and is behind in every swing state against Trump. Many Democrats fear he may have virtually no path to victory and that the party needs a new presidential candidate to take on Trump.The rally in Grand Rapids will be in an indoor arena, unlike the event in Butler, Pennsylvania last weekend, which was outdoors. At that event, the gunman was able to scale the roof of a building outside the Secret Service perimeter before opening fire on Trump, clipping his ear, killing a rally-goer and wounding several others.The U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting Trump, declined to comment on security for the Grand Rapids event. An investigation is underway into the security failures at the Butler rally.“The Secret Service does not discuss the means and methods used for our protective operations,” the agency said in a statement.Trump gave a detailed account of his narrow brush with death in his convention speech on Thursday, telling the audience that he was only talking to them “by the grace of Almighty God.” ","summary":"Donald Trump will hold his first campaign rally on Saturday since he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt one week ago and fresh from his nominating convention where his takeover of the Republican Party was cemented.Trump will appear in Grand Rapids, in the battleground state of Michigan, along with his new vice presidential pick, Ohio US Senator J.D.

It will be their first campaign event together as the now official Republican presidential ticket.Republican Party officials said during Trump’s nominating convention in Milwaukee this week that his brush with death last Saturday had changed him, and that when he made his acceptance speech on Thursday night he would call for national unity.While Trump began the address with a call for unity and national healing, much of his speech was his well-known list of grievances and attacks on opponents.It is unclear what type of speech Trump will deliver on Saturday, but his diehard supporters typically flock to such events to hear Trump’s more traditional inflammatory rhetoric.Trump and Vance will take the stage in Grand Rapids with the Republican Party unified behind them after this week’s nominating convention. In contrast, the Democrats are in turmoil and it is no longer certain that President Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in the November 5 election.Biden is facing mounting calls from many elected officials in his own party to step aside as the party’s White House candidate and to end his re-election bid, after his poor debate performance against Trump last month.Biden is trailing in opinion polls and is behind in every swing state against Trump. Many Democrats fear he may have virtually no path to victory and that the party needs a new presidential candidate to take on Trump.The rally in Grand Rapids will be in an indoor arena, unlike the event in Butler, Pennsylvania last weekend, which was outdoors. At that event, the gunman was able to scale the roof of a building outside the Secret Service perimeter before opening fire on Trump, clipping his ear, killing a rally-goer and wounding several others.The U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting Trump, declined to comment on security for the Grand Rapids event. An investigation is underway into the security failures at the Butler rally.“The Secret Service does not discuss the means and methods used for our protective operations,” the agency said in a statement.Trump gave a detailed account of his narrow brush with death in his convention speech on Thursday, telling the audience that he was only talking to them “by the grace of Almighty God.” "},{"hash":"5eb199a41fe48801552c2d010a4c19c3e5c4b75e0836563147dd6b62ada13c34","title":"the-royal-roots-of-central-zoo","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/miscellaneous/2024/07/20/the-royal-roots-of-central-zoo","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Screenshot%202024-07-20%20at%2007.24.15.png&w=900&height=601","date":1721433600000,"source":"kp","category":"miscellaneous","content":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Eight were deported, losing an average of $6 million each. Others are still trying to get to the US, and some have died along the way.\n\nTo get to the US, villagers borrow money at high interest rates. The village has become empty, with many people leaving to avoid debt collectors.\n\nDespite the dangers, some villagers still see going to the US as their only hope for a better life. However, there is little political will to address the problem, and legal remedies are inadequate.","summary":"Bharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

Coming on the heels of a poor performance in the first televised live debate by his opposition presidential candidate Joe Biden, the attack has helped the controversial Republican politician consolidate his vote bank. Luckily for him, he could raise his fist and chant “Fight, fight, fight” before being frisked away by Secret Service agents, bettering his chances of returning to the White House as undecided voters seem to buy his arguments about a plot against America. Violence against a candidate at the cusp of election only generates sympathy for them; having seen death up-close, Trump is now eyeing a resurrection of his political career.But no debate in the social media age follows the straight dichotomy of good versus evil or victim versus perpetrator. Taking cue from Trump’s own modus operandi of creating what he calls “alternative facts,” conspiracy theorists and some of his detractors have been calling the attack a plot by Trump himself to gain public sympathy. An old photo of him, with both his ears intact, has been doing the rounds on the internet, claiming that he was not injured at all. After all, this is the same man who was indicted for instigating an attack on Capitol Hill and trying to overturn the 2020 US presidential election results. From investigating crimes by him to now investigating a crime against him, US law enforcement and investigation agencies have an unexpected, rather strange, task in their hands.But amid the din of which of the old men returns to the White House as the 47th president of the United States of America or the motive of the 20-year-old Republican voter-turned-gunman or even the misgivings about Trump’s victimhood, an age-old question of gun culture has made a comeback. American gun culture has a central role in the assassination attempt on Trump, and Trump himself is one of the fiercest defenders of such a culture. And if anyone thinks Trump will now rethink his love for guns, one of his advisers, Chris LaCivita, has clarified that the ex-president will continue to protect gun rights. For the Republicans, the constitutional guarantee offered by the Second Amendment for individuals to carry guns is sacrosanct; Trump will potentially continue to exploit the Americans’ emotional attachment to the gun as a self-defense instrument.Such is the gun obsession in the United States, even after seeing the assassination of four presidents—Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy—and assassination attempts on Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W Bush, among others, the country is helpless to do much about it. The comfort of amnesia is too dear to America when it comes to dealing with the tough question of gun violence. And with a morally repugnant record of supplying arms to Israel in its attempts to wipe out the Palestinians, Trump’s opponent and sitting president Joe Biden is lost for words. The United States should really unite to wipe out gun culture.

In his 22-member Council of Ministers, Oli picked only two women while he didn’t choose a single Dalit member. There are a few things for which even those from developed countries praise Nepal and in which we Nepalis can take great pride. The inclusive constitution of Nepal promulgated in 2015 and the laws formulated in line with the charter are quite progressive. Dalits, women and other oppressed communities fought long for their representation. But it was after the success of the people’s movement in 2006 that the enforcement of inclusive policy in state agencies started to be strengthened. And the constitution formally institutionalised the achievements of the political and other movements.Unfortunately, the spirit is gradually dying. It’s not only Oli who has ignored the call for inclusivity in his Cabinet. The same trend had been in evidence in the past. The immediate past prime minister and CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who often boasts of introducing an inclusive system in the country, didn’t appoint a single minister from the Dalit community in his last Cabinet. This is a serious concern. Having a progressive constitution and laws doesn’t mean much if the leaders in the driving seats of the executive agencies trample on its spirit. If there is a community that is most discriminated against, it is the Dalits and they therefore deserve priority for representation under an inclusive system. Worryingly, leaders not only disregard the constitutional spirit but don’t follow even minimum criteria while picking ministers, lawmakers or other officials for important posts. Aspirants for ministerial berths rather often resort to various shenanigans to impress top leaders, promoting unhealthy practices in politics.

The factional feuds within the prime minister’s party for ministerial berths and bickering between coalition partners over power sharing would frustrate the public. The heads of the government would oversee a dozen ministries, hampering the government’s functioning.

As per official records, from June 10 to July 14, a total of 108 people have died, many more have been injured, and 3,552 families have been displaced across the country. The death toll is likely to mount as more bodies surface from the recent tragic Simaltal incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat road section (also called Madan Ashrit Highway), where a landslide swept two buses carrying 65 people into Trishuli River last week. It is unfortunate that our efforts to prevent human loss have been far from satisfactory. Constant politicking, lack of preparedness and a culture of dismissing expert research and suggestions on road construction all make monsoons a perfect storm of disasters. Take the Mugling-Narayanghat road. The road was widened without factoring in its geographical vulnerability and landslide risks, and the landslides there have only gotten worse in the past few years. Moreover, haphazard roads built above the major roads throughout the country have put many lives in danger, as happened during the Simaltal incident. As per a Setopati report, the debris flow brought about by the road construction in the settlements above the Simaltal area reportedly resulted in the incident.Geologists have consistently raised concerns about the risks associated with the highway; however, their words have fallen on deaf ears. In June of this year, the landslide risk assessment flagged 11 areas on the highway as zones that needed immediate study and 25 areas as prone to landslides. Similarly, according to Kaski district’s Disaster Response Plan (as reported by Himalkhabar), 25 settlements are in danger of flood and landslide in Pokhara Metropolitan City. As a part of their disaster preparedness, each district is mandated to prepare a disaster response plan. Despite this, when the time comes to act, they lack the necessary human resources, equipment, or budgetary support to prevent disasters and rescue people. We don’t have to look far to see how the country’s disaster preparedness has failed—Simaltal has received major attention in terms of rescue yet, as of now, neither the buses that were swept away nor most of those missing have been found. When it comes to dealing with disasters, our authorities have always adopted a wait-and-see approach. The Home Ministry, responsible for overseeing national disaster preparedness, issued a notice on preventive measures, including suspending the plying of vehicles at night in high-risk areas, only after the tragic incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway. These measures could still prove beneficial, but we need a long-term solution and pre-planning. As local governments are still ill-prepared to handle pre-disaster preparedness as well as post-disaster rescue efforts, it is up to the federal government to equip the community level bodies with enough budget and equipment. We have had enough of these life-threatening disasters. Even though it is already late, all three levels of government must heed the experts, engineers and geologists when constructing or widening roads. The much-needed slope stabilisation through bio-engineering should be done on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway and other risky paths without further delay. The governments should also prioritise rigorous monitoring and follow-ups on road construction. We cannot afford to lose any more lives to these disasters. ","summary":"Nepal is not even halfway through this monsoon, and the rain has already brought deadly floods and landslides. As per official records, from June 10 to July 14, a total of 108 people have died, many more have been injured, and 3,552 families have been displaced across the country. The death toll is likely to mount as more bodies surface from the recent tragic Simaltal incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat road section (also called Madan Ashrit Highway), where a landslide swept two buses carrying 65 people into Trishuli River last week. It is unfortunate that our efforts to prevent human loss have been far from satisfactory. Constant politicking, lack of preparedness and a culture of dismissing expert research and suggestions on road construction all make monsoons a perfect storm of disasters. Take the Mugling-Narayanghat road. The road was widened without factoring in its geographical vulnerability and landslide risks, and the landslides there have only gotten worse in the past few years. Moreover, haphazard roads built above the major roads throughout the country have put many lives in danger, as happened during the Simaltal incident. As per a Setopati report, the debris flow brought about by the road construction in the settlements above the Simaltal area reportedly resulted in the incident.Geologists have consistently raised concerns about the risks associated with the highway; however, their words have fallen on deaf ears. In June of this year, the landslide risk assessment flagged 11 areas on the highway as zones that needed immediate study and 25 areas as prone to landslides. Similarly, according to Kaski district’s Disaster Response Plan (as reported by Himalkhabar), 25 settlements are in danger of flood and landslide in Pokhara Metropolitan City. As a part of their disaster preparedness, each district is mandated to prepare a disaster response plan. Despite this, when the time comes to act, they lack the necessary human resources, equipment, or budgetary support to prevent disasters and rescue people.

Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy.

As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  ","summary":"The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli.

They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  "},{"hash":"7704cbcc723c01244c8c2f5ac7461181ec5eba4d1090529fc03051367e1d1675","title":"teachers-capacity-must-be-enhanced-to-implement-letter-grading-system","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/07/01/teachers-capacity-must-be-enhanced-to-implement-letter-grading-system","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/interviews/interviewushajha3-1719797957.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719792000000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"In the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation.
