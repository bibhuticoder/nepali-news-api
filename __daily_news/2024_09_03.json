But Nepali officials warned that the actual death toll could go much higher. According to the Nepali Embassy in Moscow, DNA tests are underway for more than 50 Nepali nationals believed to have been killed while fighting for Russia. This suggests that the death toll of Nepalis killed in the war could rise significantly.With the confirmation of four latest deaths of Nepali nationals, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday put the total fatalities at 40. The four victims have been identified as Bimal Limbu, Bikram Chaudhary, Dom Bahadur Ale, and Subas Thapa.Milan Tuladhar, Nepali ambassador to Russia who prematurely completed his term on Sunday and is set to return to Kathmandu soon, told the Post that the death toll could soar beyond 40 as the final DNA confirmation for as many as 50 suspected deaths of Nepal nationals is still pending.He was recalled by the incumbent government at a time when six Nepali nationals, who were killed in the Russia-Ukraine war, are in the final stages of receiving compensation.As per the Russian rules, the signatures of three diplomats serving in the embassy are required for processing the compensation, which will then be distributed through local units to the next kin of those who died in the war. However, neither side has disclosed the exact amount that the families will receive after confirmation of a death in the war, but according to multiple sources, the amount could exceed Rs20 million. And each injured person who sustained a single bullet wound in the war will receive three million rubles (or nearly Rs4.5million), and the compensation amount increases with the number of bullet wounds sustained. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and its announcement in May 2023 to recruit foreign nationals into its army, hundreds of Nepali nationals joined the Russian Army. But due to constant diplomatic effort and pressure from various levels and sectors, Russia has stopped recruiting Nepali nationals. “Russia decided to stop hiring Nepali nationals from this May. Recruitment has halted,” said Tuladhar over the phone from Moscow.He said that the compensation for six Nepali nationals who were killed in the early days of war and whose documentation has been completed, is in the final stages of being processed. “I don't know what will happen after I leave Moscow,” he said. According to him, it would take at least two months for a new ambassador to take office. The current government has nominated Jangam Chauhan as the next ambassador to Russia, and his parliamentary hearing is yet to be completed. \"Every day, we are getting new information about missing Nepalis. By October, all Nepali nationals serving in the Russian Army who want to return could be back in Nepal. But a sizeable number of Nepali nationals have obtained Russian citizenships and passports and they may not return,” he said. “Some of these Russian passports- holding Nepalis, who joined the Russian Army, are hoping to sneak into Europe. Many of them are injured in combat and are unfit to fight.\"The injured people with bullet wounds have obtained Russian passports and millions of rubles, so they don’t want to return, he said. “We met several such Nepalis and tried to convince them to return home, but they were not convinced,” he said. A senior foreign ministry official said that Russia has been reluctant to share details of Nepali nationals it had recruited into its army, including the number of recruits, deaths, injuries and contract terminations.So far, 174 Nepali nationals have returned home, as per official records. In a recent interview with Kantipur, a sister publication of the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana had said that Nepal government has consistently raised concerns with Russia regarding the recruitment of Nepali nationals into Russian Army, their numbers and status, compensation for families of those killed in the war, and the repatriation of bodies, among other things. Several families have performed the last rites of their loved ones without receiving the bodies.“During my recent conversation with the Russian ambassador, we again raised our concerns,” said the minister in her interview. “The Russian side keeps saying that since the war is ongoing, the issues of recruitment and logistics are being handled by the Russian defense ministry, not the foreign ministry.”Two former foreign ministers Narayan Kaji Shrestha and NP Saud had also discussed these concerns in detail with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin. ","summary":"At least 40 Nepali nationals have been confirmed dead while fighting for Russia in the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. But Nepali officials warned that the actual death toll could go much higher. According to the Nepali Embassy in Moscow, DNA tests are underway for more than 50 Nepali nationals believed to have been killed while fighting for Russia. This suggests that the death toll of Nepalis killed in the war could rise significantly.With the confirmation of four latest deaths of Nepali nationals, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday put the total fatalities at 40. The four victims have been identified as Bimal Limbu, Bikram Chaudhary, Dom Bahadur Ale, and Subas Thapa.Milan Tuladhar, Nepali ambassador to Russia who prematurely completed his term on Sunday and is set to return to Kathmandu soon, told the Post that the death toll could soar beyond 40 as the final DNA confirmation for as many as 50 suspected deaths of Nepal nationals is still pending.He was recalled by the incumbent government at a time when six Nepali nationals, who were killed in the Russia-Ukraine war, are in the final stages of receiving compensation.As per the Russian rules, the signatures of three diplomats serving in the embassy are required for processing the compensation, which will then be distributed through local units to the next kin of those who died in the war. However, neither side has disclosed the exact amount that the families will receive after confirmation of a death in the war, but according to multiple sources, the amount could exceed Rs20 million. And each injured person who sustained a single bullet wound in the war will receive three million rubles (or nearly Rs4.5million), and the compensation amount increases with the number of bullet wounds sustained. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and its announcement in May 2023 to recruit foreign nationals into its army, hundreds of Nepali nationals joined the Russian Army. But due to constant diplomatic effort and pressure from various levels and sectors, Russia has stopped recruiting Nepali nationals. “Russia decided to stop hiring Nepali nationals from this May. Recruitment has halted,” said Tuladhar over the phone from Moscow.He said that the compensation for six Nepali nationals who were killed in the early days of war and whose documentation has been completed, is in the final stages of being processed. “I don't know what will happen after I leave Moscow,” he said. According to him, it would take at least two months for a new ambassador to take office. The current government has nominated Jangam Chauhan as the next ambassador to Russia, and his parliamentary hearing is yet to be completed. \"Every day, we are getting new information about missing Nepalis. By October, all Nepali nationals serving in the Russian Army who want to return could be back in Nepal.

Shah has accused Oli of failing to act on repeated calls of the metropolitan city to take action against Rekha Sharma, a CPN-UML provincial assembly member in Lumbini who is accused of abusing a child domestic worker for eight years.Back-and-forth between Oli and Shah, a popular rapper, is nothing new. Prior to this, on June 3, Shah had accused Oli of ‘policy corruption’ related to the illegal land swap involving Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. This followed the intervention by then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth to halt the mayor’s plan to widen pavements in the Capital’s New Road area. On Sunday, writing on social media, Mayor Shah accused Oli of failing to act against Sharma despite repeated calls by the metropolis office for the past two months. “The court has also decided to prosecute the accused,” Shah wrote on Facebook on Sunday. “Respected prime minister, good governance entails taking action against your lawmaker accused of domestic violence.”“Perhaps to you, good governance is limited to announcing a compensation of Rs100,000 and shedding crocodile tears over her death on Facebook,” Mayor Shah said on his Facebook post, which he shared on X. But why has KMC Mayor Shah repeatedly targeted Oli?Political experts suggest that as Shah is not part of the traditional power elite, and those traditional elites are not ready to welcome him, such clashes are to be expected. “Mayor Shah has taken an unconventional approach in dealing with the old political elite, which has increased friction between them,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post.Shah had also targeted Oli and his party colleagues earlier when they intervened in the mayor’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area. This time, as the UML is obstructing Shah’s efforts to implement the Supreme Court ruling to vacate the Bagmati riverside land, he has again targeted the party and its chief, according to a close aide to the mayor.Following the Supreme Court’s ruling—whose full text was issued on July 15—ordering authorities to clear settlements along the Bagmati River and its tributaries in the Kathmandu Valley, KMC issued a notice on August 8 to clear the settlements. The KMC notice also bans new construction within an additional 20 metres beyond the previously designated riverbank area.In the full text of the ruling, the Supreme Court also deemed the government’s standard of leaving 20 metres clear on riverbanks to be insufficient and has ordered an additional 20 metres be added.The Supreme Court ruling was against the Cabinet decision of October 17, 2008, which had set the 20-metre clearance requirement for riverside areas in Kathmandu. According to the decision, construction was allowed only if a 20-metre buffer was left on both sides of the Bagmati, Bishnumati and Manohora rivers, while the buffer for other riverbanks is between 4-20 metres. A joint bench of Supreme Court Justice Ananda Mohan Bhattarai and Binod Sharma had issued the order against the earlier cabinet decision. The top court issued a verdict on it on December 19 last year. Soon after the court’s full text came out, KMC had said that it would fully implement the court’s decision. According to the KMC notice, the prohibition on construction will now extend to 40 metres on either side of Bagmati, Bishnumati and Manohara rivers.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted within an additional 20 metres on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.” The Kathmandu district committee of the UML protested the municipal notice. On August 26, the committee also met Prime Minister Oli to express its concerns and requested a judicial review of the Supreme Court’s decision to ban construction on an additional 20 metres of land. “If the KMC notice is implemented, it will not only affect a large section of Kathmandu’s population, but also impact World Heritage sites like the Pashupatinath Temple,” says Rajan Bhattarai, the Bagmati Province in-charge of the UML. “The municipal decision is not pragmatic and its repercussions are already being felt,” Bhattarai told the Post. “Following the municipal notice, homeowners with bank mortgages are in serious trouble as the banks have started demanding alternative collateral.”“While we respect the court’s decision, its implementation will lead to severe financial problems for the country,” Bhattarai added. Subedi, the political analyst, doesn’t agree.“If the court’s decision is problematic, the government has the option to challenge it,” Subedi said. “This has nothing to do with Mayor Shah.”The UML district committee is scheduled to meet with Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba on Tuesday to discuss the matter, and also plans to meet Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, according to Bhattarai.

Asked about how his government would support the LGBTQIA+ community, Oli admitted, “I do not know much about this issue.” This can be considered unusual for a politician who has offered his takes on everything from the domains of Hindu religious epics to linguistics.“What did he say, something till Q?” Oli said during the National Youth Conclave on August 24. “Yes, LGBTQ. Every individual, whoever they are, should have their rights established. But marriage between the same gender is something I do not understand. What does that mean? I don’t know.” The crowd received Oli’s remarks with loud cheers. The footage of the remarks went viral across social media platforms.Oli’s admission of ignorance comes at a time when Nepal has earned a reputation globally for being favourable for the LGBTQIA+ community. It is perhaps one of the few subjects that has put Nepal on the global map recently.“Nepal leads inaugural Rainbow Tourism Conference, pledges safe destination for all,” reports the Hindustan Times. “Why Nepal could be the next big LGBTQ travel destination,” CNN wonders. ILGA Asia celebrates, “Nepal: Marriage Registration for Same-Sex Couples after seminal court ruling.” The BBC: “Nepal registers first same-sex marriage, celebrated as a win for LGBT rights.”Oli’s admission, made in front of a large audience, makes the international praise ring hollow, say Nepal’s gender activists, casting doubt on how genuinely inclusive the country’s environment is for its queer community.The comment has also ignited disappointment and disillusionment among those who had hoped the government would be a strong ally in their fight for rights.“If the policymakers and high-ranking officials like the prime minister do not know the issues, they need to collaborate, they need to invite us to build their capacity in this regard,” says Manisha Dhakal, the executive director of the Blue Diamond Society (BDS), Nepal’s pioneering queer rights group.Meanwhile, Laxmi Ghalan, founding president of Mitini Nepal, another queer rights organisation, describes Oli’s response as “unexpected” and indicative of a superficial understanding of the LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal. “We believe that the prime minister’s response might weaken our community’s movement and extend the battle for the rights we are seeking,” Ghalan says. “In any civilised society, the issues of minorities are always given priority. However, when the prime minister makes a casual remark like ‘I don’t know much about this,’ even after the constitution has acknowledged this community, it raises concerns that our struggle might continue for a longer time.”Even with constitutional recognition, true equality remains elusive if those in power are uninformed or indifferent, says Pinky Gurung, president of the BDS.“From his response, it seems like he has accepted gender issues,” Gurung says. “But by saying he doesn’t understand the issue of same-sex marriage, he has diplomatically shown positive ignorance. I don’t think he has the liberty to say that he doesn’t understand or have much knowledge on an issue because he is not an ordinary citizen. He is the country’s prime minister!”Gurung adds that such rhetoric might perpetuate ignorance and prejudice among the broader population, and trickle down to the daily lives of queer individuals.For instance, Anamika Chhetri, 31, and her 22-year-old sibling, both trans women, have been victims of such rhetoric. Chhetri’s sibling had gender reassignment surgery three years ago, while Chhetri is currently on hormone therapy.In June, National Assembly member Ranju Jha made controversial remarks about hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery. “With hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery—men becoming women and women becoming men…,” Jha said. “I don’t know if I should call it a right or what. We cannot recognise women who have undergone these processes as ‘women.’”The Yogyakarta Principles, developed in 2006 and endorsed by experts like former Nepal parliament member Sunil Babu Pant, affirm that each person’s self-declared sexual orientation and gender identity are fundamental to their identity, autonomy, dignity, and freedom.These principles emphasise that legal recognition of gender should not depend on medical procedures. However, if someone chooses medical assistance for their transition, those services should be accessible.The siblings, who came out in 2022, initially struggled for parental acceptance. With the help of their nurse sister, they managed to persuade their parents. However, Jha’s comments shattered this hard-earned acceptance, leading their parents to view them as “abnormal” again, Chhetri says.Since Jha’s remarks, Chhetri and her siblings have not been able to visit their parents, and the supportive environment they had found was lost, Chhetri adds.After Jha’s comments, Chhetri experienced mental and emotional distress, feeling that her life, which was finally improving, had been derailed once more by a remark made by a parliamentarian.“The PM’s comments have thrown me back into the same turmoil,” Chhetri says. “When powerful figures like the prime minister or parliamentarians make such remarks, it deeply affects us. We constantly struggle to prove our normalcy and existence, and such incidents undermine all our efforts, reducing us to the subject of jokes and memes.”Meanwhile, Alisha, a bisexual woman from Kathmandu, says that the prime minister’s remarks showed that he was irresponsible to his duties. “The PM’s later remarks about ‘establishing justice’ seemed like an attempt to salvage his earlier statement,” says Alisha, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy reasons. “But how can we trust him to ensure justice when he admits, ‘I am not aware of this issue,’ and adds, ‘I don’t need to know everything’?”No matter what PM said in the end, Alisha adds, only the earlier sentence regarding his disregarding of the LGBTQIA+ community has been circulating in social media and is being used against them.The impact of the video has indeed been deep. Rishi (name changed for privacy), a 28-year-old gay man from Lalitpur, is also bearing the brunt of the prime minister’s remarks, he says. Since Oli’s controversial remark went viral, Rishi has been bombarded with memes, the video clip, and taunting messages from his relatives and even an old class bully.Rishi has not left his home for the past five days, struggling with the emotional toll it has taken on him, he says. “The hope I had after hearing about the news of registration of the first same-sex marriage towards the end of 2023 has turned into hopelessness,” Rishi says. “When the prime minister says, ‘I don’t know,’ what can I expect from the government?” The negative impact of political rhetoric on LGBTQIA+ communities is not confined to Nepal. In the United States, research following the 2016 presidential election highlighted how anti-queer rhetoric during the campaign led to an increase in reported hate crimes against LGBTQIA+ individuals.The ‘Southern Poverty Law Center’ (SPLC) documented a significant rise in hate incidents following the election, many of which were directly linked to the rhetoric used by political figures.In countries where politicians have made openly homophobic or transphobic statements, such as Russia or Uganda, there has been a corresponding increase in violence and discrimination against LGBTQIA+ individuals.Studies have shown that these remarks not only fuel societal prejudice but also embolden law enforcement and judicial systems to act against queer communities.The fear and anxiety generated by such remarks can lead to psychological distress, as evidenced by the mental health struggles reported by LGBTQIA+ individuals like Rishi and Chhetri in the aftermath of the politically charged rhetoric.As Gurung points out, Oli’s remarks give the impression that LGBTQIA+ issues are not a priority for the government. “When the prime minister doesn’t know about our struggles, it gives the impression to the general public that when even the government is not willing to learn about LGBTQ+ issues, why would the general public care?” Gurung says.In response to the viral statement, the Prime Minister’s press secretary, Ram Sharan Bajagain, said that “the prime minister responding with ‘I am not aware much about the issue’ is the admission that there is always more to learn for everyone.” “He will engage in the necessary discourse to understand what he’s currently unfamiliar with,” Bajagain said.

Tulchha Bohara pulled one back for Sudurpaschim.Sudurpaschim were toothless both in front and back, lacked composure and were disorganised throughout the game.

Gurung started harvesting apples two weeks ago after they began turning red.However, he faces a big problem. Transportation in the southern part of Gorkha has become a major issue due to heavy monsoon rains that have severely damaged the roads. Despite the excellent harvest, apple farmers like Gurung are deeply frustrated.“I have around 400 kg of apples sitting unsold,” said Gurung, who started an apple farm four years ago. “It’s been two weeks, and I still haven't been able to send them to the market.”This year, he harvested over 670 kg of apples from 900 trees in his orchard, which started producing apples last year. In the first batch, he harvested 200 kg and distributed them to neighbours and relatives as souvenirs.“This year, the young apple trees yielded 3 to 4 kg of apples per tree. I managed to sell 200 kg to the hotels along the trekking in Philim and Manasulu by carrying them in bamboo baskets on my back,” he said. He has another 400 kgs of apples stored at home. “There are still some apples on the trees,” said Gurung. “If I don’t pluck them soon, they will fall,” Gurung said. “But there is no vehicle to transport apples to the market.”It takes three hours to reach Philim Bazar on foot.The track to Larke, which was opened in the winter and allowed jeeps, trucks, and tractors to reach Pangsing Pass, one of the routes connecting the Chinese border in the north, has now been blocked by frequent landslides and mudslides, particularly during the ongoing monsoon season.Lapu is the closest station where vehicles are available, but it is a day-long hike from his farm.Apple farmers say they have the option of transporting apples on the backs of mules, but there is a big risk of damaging the fruits.Gurung, who runs Pati Krishi Tatha Pashupanchhi Farm, sold apples for Rs250 per kg in the village, but there were few customers.Villagers say that supplying apples to the market at this time of year fetches a better price.Gurung returned to Nepal in 2011 after working as a migrant in Malaysia and started livestock farming and agriculture. He invested Rs5 million in his farm, which has 600 walnut plants.Commercial apple farming has thrived in areas like Pangsing and Aagasarseu of Shardibas, and in Namrung of Chumnubri Rural Municipality. However, lack of transportation has left commercial apple growers frustrated, as they face the prospect of losing considerable income this year just before Nepal’s biggest festivals—Dashain and Tihar, which fall in October-November.There are more than 12,000 apple orchards in Namrung. Lakpa Thendup Lama, who also decided to engage in apple farming four years ago in Namrung, is facing a tough year. “This year, apple yield has doubled, and harvesting has already begun,” Lama said. But, the lack of transportation has dampened his spirits. “Last year, too, we sold our apples to tourists and hotels in the Manasulu area.” Lama recalled. He had hoped to get a good price for his apples by supplying them to the markets, but has not been able to do so.He plans to turn the unsold apples into sukuti (dried fruit). He has branded the fruit as ‘Chumnubri Apple’.It takes around three days to reach Arughat from Namrung.“Jeeps used to operate in Pangsing, but with the roads in poor condition, they are now empty, and so is our business,” Lama said.Lama has an apple orchard on 300 ropani (15.26 hectares) .Two years ago, he exported apples to Kathmandu by helicopter, but it was too costly, he said.“Supplying apples by helicopter is not possible now. It costs Rs250,000 a trip.”Several varieties of apples, like golden, fuji, and red delicious, are grown in Gorkha.The area is 2,650 metres from sea level, giving a geographical advantage for producing apples.Ashok Joshi, chief of the agriculture department in the rural municipality, said there has been a rapid increase in commercial apple growers in Chumnumbri.“It has been 4-5 years since commercial apple farming started in the region. There are 6-7 commercial growers now.”“Apple production has increased this year compared to last year.However, Joshi pointed out that the high cost of transportation and the lack of storage facilities are major concerns, which have dampened the spirits of Nepali growers who aim to reduce imports.Nepal imported 82,145 tonnes of apples in the last fiscal year, amounting to Rs8.44 billion, mainly from China.The locals said the improved road connectivity could help reduce import of apples.

It was later discovered that the grenade was a remnant of the Maoist war (1996-2006). It was a clear reminder that passage of the transitional law alone is not enough to put the violent past to rest.The guns in a decade-long war fell silent with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, which stated that “both sides [the Government of Nepal and Maoists] shall assist each other to mark landmines and booby-traps used during the time of armed conflict by providing necessary information within 30 days and defuse and excavate them within 60 days.” Yet, nearly two decades later, the randomly left weapons from the conflict period continue to endanger people. The Panchthar case is one of several examples. In its recent editorial, Kantipur, the Post’s sister publication, highlighted six such incidents of explosions following the CPA’s signing. To take just two examples, in the explosion on April 30, 2020, two children had perished, while on October 29, 2022, four children had died.

Yet even the amended Act has loopholes. Even though the new bill addresses incidents of post-war explosions and promises relief to the victims, it is silent on locating and destroying all the remaining explosives from the conflict period. Such random explosions and death of civilians will also puncture the picture of Nepal’s successful peace process that the country rightly takes great pride in. It is time for the government to carry out its legal obligations, honour the promises made in the CPA, and ensure that there is no more risk to public life from stray bombs and booby traps. To start with, there must be comprehensive mapping of all the war-time weapons, and the ex-Maoist leaders as well as the security forces should join hands to solve this lingering problem. Also, on a more philosophical note, even if the peace process is successfully concluded, the stray bombs are also a reminder that you can never fully recover from a bloody civil war.

The locals discovered the crime in a nearby forest several months after the gruesome murder. The Myagdi police have recently arrested the suspects and are collecting evidence to present to the court. The victim’s parents are too poor and unable to speak out, but some local Dalits have been pressurising the district administration to deliver justice through street demonstrations and lobbying. As Myagdi’s Chief District Officer and Police officials tried to reassure us during our meeting, the legal process seems to be progressing smoothly. Unlike in most cases of violence against Dalits, political parties haven't interfered with the legal process on behalf of the murderer. Yet the agitating Dalits aren’t entirely convinced of a positive outcome. They will continue to monitor the case closely, and our activist organisation, the Caste Watch Network (CWN), will do the same from our end in Kathmandu. The persistent interference of corrupt and immoral politicians has worsened a poorly resourced and unreliable judicial system. This issue has severely impacted the entire country. People of all castes, particularly the poor and the marginalised, suffer from the denial of justice. The numbers of Dalits affected by this are, however, disproportionately higher. We need to reform and revitalise the political and legal systems to get to the bottom of the dire situation of Dalits and seek appropriate remedies. The government and policymakers must pay more attention to the informal causes of caste violence and other forms of Dalit suffering, namely the religious and the spiritual. Hidden in plain sight Nepal’s Dalits suffer from what Columbia University Professor Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak famously called “epistemic violence”. This means that the upper castes control what they know and how they know. Dalit heads have Bahun brains; Dalit eyes have Bahun visions. They are often unable to separate the wheat from the chaff.Let me be more explicit with a typical example of Dalit exclusion in towns. Most Dalits, including politicians and activists, struggle to rent property in places like Kathmandu, Pokhara and Beni because of the landlord’s fear of offending their lineage deities and ancestral spirits. There’s a wide understanding that the family deities and spirits don’t tolerate the breakdown of traditional caste rules, especially intermixing with the low caste.In reality, Dalit intelligentsia and political class hardly ever mention this widely experienced cause of Dalit suffering. They may express their outrage and even take to the streets when the media covers an incident. Still, they don’t seriously consider targeting the causes rooted in religious and spiritual beliefs. Most of the time, they dream of and talk about securing a place in the state mechanism. As instructed by their upper-caste political masters, Dalit activists believe that proportional representation and implementation of the modern laws alone would end caste discrimination. They fail to highlight that casteist texts and traditions, rituals and customs amongst Hindus and (to a degree) other faiths have effectively blocked the modern anti-caste laws. The same epistemological confusion among mainstream Dalits surfaced in our discussion with Dalit activists in Beni on Sunday afternoon. Those deeply involved in party politics argued that religion had little or no influence on perpetuating the exclusion of and violence against Dalits. For them, proportional representation of Dalits in the state, including parliament and government, was paramount. But the parents and close relatives of the murder victim—who lived in a remote village and were uneducated and inactive in party politics—had no delusions about the role of religious beliefs and practices in the loss of their daughter. Living in a highly segregated community, they suffered various forms of humiliation, exclusion and mental torture based on people’s eagerness to abide by what they saw as the divine authority on caste hierarchy. What was written in the 2006 law against caste discrimination and in the 2015 secular constitution of the country didn’t matter at all in the village life!A man having an extramarital affair, or even two wives, wasn’t per se a new or unacceptable thing in their traditional society in Myagdi. Most intolerable for the high-caste family and the entire village was the involvement of a Damai woman—someone considered ritually polluted. She had to be disposed of not because of her personal shortcomings or behaviour but because her marriage would potentially invite the terrible wrath of lineage deities, village gods and goddesses, so much so that those offended spirits could cause death and destruction in the family, the kinship, and the whole village! It was thus deemed a terrible danger to everybody. Perhaps this danger encouraged the suspected culprit and his family to kill both the woman and her foetus. It was probably considered the safest way forward, given that the woman belonged to a typically poor and outcast family. Everything I’ve stated here is no new knowledge. However, I worry about the persistent silence around the issue of religious beliefs perpetuating caste hatred. Just because these religious/spiritual causes don’t count in the legal process doesn’t mean we shouldn’t consider them. If we want to liberate Dalits from oppression in their everyday lives, these common causes shouldn’t be ignored. Mitigation strategiesIt’s time the Nepali parliament and government seriously considered the problem of caste hatred and violence instigated by religious and cultural beliefs—something not exclusive to Hindus anymore. They should support and encourage sociological and anthropological research to examine what’s happening on the ground level and what’s stopping the force of law from influencing people’s lives. It’s also imperative for the Dalit activists to wake up to the fact that caste hate is not just a political and legal matter; it’s also a religious and cultural issue. No law can be effectively employed until it synchronises with popular customs and beliefs. Dalits must stop believing what their political masters tell them and focus more on religious and spiritual causes. This could be based on their own experiences and observations. It’s well-known that many Dalit ministers and MPs have struggled to rent properties around Singha Durbar.The entire Dalit community wants to see the murderer of a pregnant Dalit teenager in Myagdi duly punished. Pursuing justice is crucial, and we should all join hands to ensure that the culprits don’t evade jail.We should be equally mindful that throwing a few criminals in prison hasn’t—will not—per se trigger societal change. Dalit lives and properties will be safer only when the deeply ingrained religious and spiritual causes are tackled.

It’s well-known that many Dalit ministers and MPs have struggled to rent properties around Singha Durbar.The entire Dalit community wants to see the murderer of a pregnant Dalit teenager in Myagdi duly punished. Pursuing justice is crucial, and we should all join hands to ensure that the culprits don’t evade jail.We should be equally mindful that throwing a few criminals in prison hasn’t—will not—per se trigger societal change. Dalit lives and properties will be safer only when the deeply ingrained religious and spiritual causes are tackled.

While some Southeast Asian countries make claims to the oceanic space in the South China Sea that falls within their respective Exclusive Economic Zones, China makes a claim on almost its entirety. China’s muscle-flexing behaviour to assert its claims carries the seeds of a potential conflagration. By doing this, China is violating the globally accepted rules-based order and is thus a concern for maintaining regional peace.China has territorial disputes with a number of Southeast Asian countries, the most prominent of these being with the Philippines. As the Philippines is an alliance partner of the US, American officials throughout 2024 have been privately and publicly signalling to their Chinese counterparts that the North American nation is firmly committed to upholding its alliance commitments. The message is intended as a warning not to test the limits of American tolerance towards Chinese attempts to obstruct access to the Second Thomas Shoal, a submerged reef in the South China Sea where a grounded Philippines vessel, the Sierra Madre, serves as an outpost for Filipino soldiers. The disputes stemming over competing claims have been intensifying, thereby raising concerns about an outbreak of war and thus a threat to regional stability.In response to the escalations, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia have reinforced their presence in the contested waters as the US steps up its intervention. Chinese maritime expert Wu Shicun, who heads the state-funded National Institute for South China Sea Studies and spent years researching the South China Sea, its history and geography as well as the regional disputes over this strategic waterway, defends China’s claims and blames Philippines for having been the first country to violate Beijing’s rights in the South China Sea in the 1970s, when China was in the grip of the Cultural Revolution. Wu Shicun accuses then President Ferdinand Marcos Sr of sending the military to take over a number of islands, including Feixin (Flat) Island and Zhongye (Thitu) Island.Wu further observes that Beijing and Taipei did not respond then militarily, allowing Manila in 1971 to gain control of more islands and reefs. Wu rubbishes as erroneous the arbitration by the international arbitral tribunal in The Hague which in July 2016 backed Manila and ruled Beijing’s claims had no basis under international law. It was a landmark victory for the Philippines, which filed the case. The Philippines was forced to approach the Hague court when Beijing closed all options for the dialogue. Beijing has rejected the ruling. Beijing ought to be aware that the Philippines is a US treaty ally and that the latter would intervene in defence of its treaty partner if a war breaks out over the South China Sea. In fact, the possibility of war cannot be ruled out.For example, when on June 17, 2024, the Chinese coast guard seized firearms from Filipino sailors at Renai Jiao during a confrontation, a trigger could have accidentally been pulled leading to an armed conflict. That the June 17 incident between Chinese and Philippine vessels did not escalate into outright armed conflict is due to some restraint and a whole lot of luck. The world had come dangerously close to a full-scale conflict on the issue of South China Sea but it was averted because of restraint exercised by both sides. As per international law that qualifies for sovereign immunity status, the boarding and seizure of Philippine Navy boats could have been construed as an act of war.Had the Sierra Madre—still a commissioned navy vessel despite being grounded and disused since 1999 been boarded in the heated frenzy, the situation could have easily escalated out of control and potentially triggered the Mutual Defence Treaty between the Philippines and the US. In the end good sense prevailed and a major escalation was prevented. The Mutual Defense Treaty was not invoked in large part because Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr had set the bar pretty high at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June 2024 where he had mentioned categorically that if any Filipino participants, civilian or otherwise, would have been killed, he would consider that the red line was crossed. While Beijing is unsure what the red lines would be, Manila has assiduously avoided invocation of the treaty in order not to escalate tensions further.The provocation did not stop with the June 17 incident. The Philippines and China clashed in the disputed waters of the South China Sea on August 25 over what Manila said was a resupply mission for fishermen, the latest in a series of sea and air confrontations in the strategic waterway. The incident overshadowed efforts by both nations to rebuild trust and better manage disputes after months of confrontation. Though the possibility of the US being drawn into a direct conflict could be a certainty, it remains to be seen if Washington would be willing to be engaged in a direct conflict with China for the Philippines, as such a situation could get out of control and would inevitably draw other countries in as well.A conflict would dramatically impact on regional security and also leave a debilitating effect on the economies of several Asian countries and also on the world economy. If this is the scenario, can a new consensus be explored in which the rival claimants work together to demilitarise the South China Sea? As a code of conduct has remained elusive for considerable time, other agreements may be explored to slowly demilitarise the South China Sea.

Palesha Goverdhan clinched Nepal’s maiden Olympics-level medal in Paris early on Saturday, sending ripples of excitement and hope across her homeland. Goverdhan seemed destined for success given her stellar track record in international meets over the past few years. Four years ago, Goverdhan, who entered the Tokyo Paralympic Games on a wildcard, had also qualified for the bronze medal final but had lost the bout. Two years later, at the Asian Para Games 2022 in Hangzhou, China, Goverdhan won a medal. She then became the first Nepali paralympian to qualify for the Paralympic Games. And now the 21-year-old has delivered on the biggest stage. After Goverdhan’s victory, her coach Kabi Raj Negi Lama rightly said that his charge had shattered the assumption that a Nepali could never win an Olympic medal. Yet it had appeared that way only a fortnight ago when none of the seven Nepali athletes who took part in the Paris Summer Olympics could create much of an impact. The usual suspects were blamed for their failure: Nepal’s poor sporting infrastructures, paucity of high-level practice, lack of professionalism, etc. Nepal, it seemed, would have to wait for a long time for Olympics success. That was until Goverdhan bagged the taekwondo bronze at the Paris Paralympics. This sends a vital message to other Nepali athletes as well as the Nepali state. One, as coach Lama hinted, Goverdhan’s medal breaks down the psychological barrier that a Nepali cannot succeed at the highest level. There is no inherent reason Nepali athletes or para-athletes cannot make their mark if they get the right kind of state support. Concomitantly, the message that a woman with a disability can capture her country’s attention and bring it international fame is no less important in what is still a patriarchal society. Nepali female athletes are world class, as the country’s women football and cricket teams have repeatedly shown. With a little more impetus, the sky’s the limit of what they can achieve. Goverdhan’s success is also an example of long-term thinking. After her failure to win a medal in Tokyo, Goverdhan pushed herself hard in the following years, and much of the time after that was spent preparing for the next Parlalympics. This suggests that Nepal would do well to start investing for success at Los Angeles 2028 right now as a part of the country’s long term sporting vision. There have of late been some positive gestures from the Nepali state. For instance, this year’s policies and programmes promises fellowships to 1,000 talented youths in various fields, including in sports. There will be special focus on cultivating women athletes. Similarly, various incentives and allowances have also been declared for the Nepali sports stars who achieve international success. There is also a new emphasis on building new stadiums and upgrading existing ones. If all these schemes materialise, greater international sporting success for Nepal will be guaranteed. This is crucial. Nepali youths are desperate for home-grown international idols, whose success inspires and is worthy of emulation. If they see their peers compete and even win against the best in the world, their ambitions will soar. This in turn will boost the morale of their country. As we have repeatedly seen, international sporting success is a glue that binds this diverse country closer. The more, the merrier.  ","summary":"The 60-year-old jinx has finally been broken.

Most of those hiding inside were killed, while Hersh lost the lower part of his left arm.Video showed him being loaded with other hostages onto a pickup van, his injury clearly visible.He was last seen alive in a Hamas video released in April, addressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then his family, giving the first public sign that he had survived his injuries.On Sunday, following the return of the bodies, an autopsy revealed he and the other five hostages had been shot at close range within 48 hours before Israeli forces arrived and recovered the bodies in a tunnel under Gaza.In a picturesque Jerusalem neighbourhood close to where his family lived, red and white banners bearing his image - a smiling young man with an open shirt and a small beard - dot the streets and hang from balconies, with the message “Free Hersh”.The death of the six, after nearly 11 months in captivity, sparked a wave of protests, with around 500,000 people taking to the streets in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on Sunday night. The protests continued into Monday with a general strike to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the hostages home.Talks to bring the hostages back and end the fighting in Gaza, where Israel’s campaign to crush Hamas has destroyed much of the Gaza Strip and killed more than 40,000 people according to Palestinian figures, have stalled.Hersh’s parents, Rachel and Jon Goldberg-Polin, have worked to raise awareness of the hostages’ plight since their son’s abduction, meeting officials, including U.

According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static.

It was Vikram Misri’s second foreign trip within a month since his appointment as India’s foreign secretary, after Bhutan. Getting too much invested into whether the alliance of the two largest forces, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, in Kathmandu, was/is of India’s liking and whether Delhi was caught by surprise at UML boss KP Oli’s return to power, will be a sheer waste of time. It, however, is a fact that the Narendra Modi government did feel the need to renew and reinforce its “Neighbourhood First Policy” vis-à-vis Nepal amid rapid changes in the region. Reciprocation from Kathmandu was expected. A week later, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba flew to Delhi, carrying an invitation from her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. There was no dearth of optics—that Modi “agreed” to a meeting with Rana, reports suggesting it was a late-hour development, found quite some space in the Kathmandu media that described the one-on-one talks with the Indian prime minister as the icing on the cake. Upon her return, Rana dubbed her visit “highly successful”, continuing the trend that her predecessors have duly maintained regardless of the outcomes.Some cheerleaders were confused about what should be marked as the highlight of the visit—an agreement on the export of additional power to India or “the unexpected welcome” accorded by Delhi to Rana. Text and contextDiplomacy has its own choreography—the almost simultaneous announcements of visits by two countries, followed by statements from both states upon the conclusion of the visits.India’s Ministry of External Affairs put out elaborate statements, emphasising that “Nepal is a priority partner of India under its Neighbourhood First Policy.” Nepal’s “sagacious” Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrapped things up with brief statements, describing the visits as a continuation of the regular exchange of high-level visits between the two friendly nations.Some may argue that substance matters more than text, but it’s the text that sets the tone for the context.India’s Neighbourhood First Policy has often faced criticism at home and in the neighbourhood. In Nepal’s case, relations between Kathmandu and Delhi over the last decade have seen ups and downs, with ties at some points hitting rock bottom.After ruling the world’s largest democracy with a majority for two terms, Modi’s third stint has a subdued mandate—he has coalition partners to “manage,” while the opposition has emerged as a strong force.Frequent government changes in Kathmandu may have caused some inconvenience in Delhi, which often faces accusations of engineering them. However, its dealings with Nepal have largely remained the same, with just a little tweaking here and there in the modus operandi.What happened in Bangladesh in the first week of August served as a wake-up call for Delhi.In Bangladesh’s deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, India had found the most stable partner in the region. Delhi turned a blind eye even as Hasina ruled with an iron grip, and her party was accused of rigging elections. The democratic backsliding in the country of 170 million people was not much of a concern for Delhi, as it was content with its strong ties with Hasina.It is surprising that Delhi completely ignored the fact that Hasina had entirely lost touch with the people. When mass protests reached a flashpoint, forcing Hasina to flee on August 5, Delhi was caught off guard by her “request to come to India at a very short notice.” Hasina continues to be in India, her asylum pleas pending. For Delhi, the one-time most trusted partner could become a headache if she starts playing politics in her home country from India.Having scant or no understanding of the ground reality in the neighbourhood has posed a serious question about India’s preponderance in the region.A renewal of the Neighbourhood First Policy became urgent, and to start with, Kathmandu—a longstanding partner for Delhi—was naturally the best bet. And there is actually nothing wrong with that.Subtext India is well placed in South Asia—geographically and economically. But other states in the region are dealing with their own problems. Not much needs to be said about Pakistan. Afghanistan is turning into a pariah state under the Taliban. After falling into an economic abyss, Sri Lanka is now struggling to navigate through.

For India, China’s growing influence in Nepal has snowballed from a minor inconvenience into a constant vexation.

After all, in this new world order, interests take precedence over anything else.A hostile neighbourhood is not in India’s interest, and an overly concerned and suspicious India is not in the region's interest.It’s time for Nepal to step up to the plate. ","summary":"Less than a month after the new coalition took shape in Nepal, Delhi sent its emissary to Kathmandu. It was Vikram Misri’s second foreign trip within a month since his appointment as India’s foreign secretary, after Bhutan. Getting too much invested into whether the alliance of the two largest forces, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, in Kathmandu, was/is of India’s liking and whether Delhi was caught by surprise at UML boss KP Oli’s return to power, will be a sheer waste of time. It, however, is a fact that the Narendra Modi government did feel the need to renew and reinforce its “Neighbourhood First Policy” vis-à-vis Nepal amid rapid changes in the region. Reciprocation from Kathmandu was expected. A week later, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba flew to Delhi, carrying an invitation from her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. There was no dearth of optics—that Modi “agreed” to a meeting with Rana, reports suggesting it was a late-hour development, found quite some space in the Kathmandu media that described the one-on-one talks with the Indian prime minister as the icing on the cake. Upon her return, Rana dubbed her visit “highly successful”, continuing the trend that her predecessors have duly maintained regardless of the outcomes.Some cheerleaders were confused about what should be marked as the highlight of the visit—an agreement on the export of additional power to India or “the unexpected welcome” accorded by Delhi to Rana. Text and contextDiplomacy has its own choreography—the almost simultaneous announcements of visits by two countries, followed by statements from both states upon the conclusion of the visits.India’s Ministry of External Affairs put out elaborate statements, emphasising that “Nepal is a priority partner of India under its Neighbourhood First Policy.” Nepal’s “sagacious” Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrapped things up with brief statements, describing the visits as a continuation of the regular exchange of high-level visits between the two friendly nations.Some may argue that substance matters more than text, but it’s the text that sets the tone for the context.India’s Neighbourhood First Policy has often faced criticism at home and in the neighbourhood. In Nepal’s case, relations between Kathmandu and Delhi over the last decade have seen ups and downs, with ties at some points hitting rock bottom.After ruling the world’s largest democracy with a majority for two terms, Modi’s third stint has a subdued mandate—he has coalition partners to “manage,” while the opposition has emerged as a strong force.Frequent government changes in Kathmandu may have caused some inconvenience in Delhi, which often faces accusations of engineering them. However, its dealings with Nepal have largely remained the same, with just a little tweaking here and there in the modus operandi.What happened in Bangladesh in the first week of August served as a wake-up call for Delhi.In Bangladesh’s deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, India had found the most stable partner in the region. Delhi turned a blind eye even as Hasina ruled with an iron grip, and her party was accused of rigging elections. The democratic backsliding in the country of 170 million people was not much of a concern for Delhi, as it was content with its strong ties with Hasina.It is surprising that Delhi completely ignored the fact that Hasina had entirely lost touch with the people. When mass protests reached a flashpoint, forcing Hasina to flee on August 5, Delhi was caught off guard by her “request to come to India at a very short notice.” Hasina continues to be in India, her asylum pleas pending. For Delhi, the one-time most trusted partner could become a headache if she starts playing politics in her home country from India.Having scant or no understanding of the ground reality in the neighbourhood has posed a serious question about India’s preponderance in the region.A renewal of the Neighbourhood First Policy became urgent, and to start with, Kathmandu—a longstanding partner for Delhi—was naturally the best bet. And there is actually nothing wrong with that.Subtext India is well placed in South Asia—geographically and economically. But other states in the region are dealing with their own problems. Not much needs to be said about Pakistan. Afghanistan is turning into a pariah state under the Taliban. After falling into an economic abyss, Sri Lanka is now struggling to navigate through. Myanmar is fighting its own war. Not long ago, the Maldives declared “India out,” with a clear intent to partner with China instead. And in Nepal, there’s Oli, whose constant blowing hot and cold has been a source of irritation for Delhi in the past.Nepal-India ties hit a low in the aftermath of the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal in 2015. India’s terse response and border blockade worked as a glue for Nepal’s ever-squabbling parties to align together, and they turned to China.

Besides, as Nepal’s e-commerce grows, now more than ever, instances of consumers fraud are becoming more prevalent.Nepal’s quality control watchdog, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, filed 178 cases in district administration offices against producers and traders for producing and selling substandard food items and animal feed in the last fiscal year. There were 121 cases in the previous fiscal year. Consumer rights activists say the district administrations deliver justice in only a handful of cases.Speaking at the interaction, lawmakers criticised party politics for protecting wrongdoers.They said that whenever market inspection teams raid certain shops or factories, top officials receive phone calls to protect those businesses. On May 28, the budget announced the allocation of necessary funds to set up consumer courts. An official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies said that the government allocated a budget of Rs10 million for administrative expenses to establish at least one consumer court in one of the districts in Kathmandu Valley. However, setting up consumer courts requires a considerable amount of money. As a temporary measure to comply with the Supreme Court’s order, officials plan to rent a separate room in a district administration office to set up the court, which will then begin hearing cases.Consumer rights activists said that forming a court within a month is impossible.“I attended the function when the industry minister Bhandari delivered his speech. We applauded, and the function concluded,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“This is one of the glaring examples of how promises are made and not delivered.”“A consumer court inside a district administrative office, with a limited budget and few judges, is a joke,” said Maharjan. The top court had ordered the setting up of consumer courts in all 77 districts with separate infrastructure. In mid-June, the Industry Ministry's draft report on establishing a consumer court was submitted to the Law Ministry and sent to the Judicial Council for its suggestions.However, Ashok Kumar Chhetri, spokesperson for the Judicial Council, said he was unaware of the development.“The draft regarding the formation of consumer courts has not come to my notice.” The Consumer Protection Act, 2018, has a provision requiring the government to establish consumer courts. Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a draft of legislation to the Ministry of Law in September 2019. As the process dragged on, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated instances of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in government.According to an official update on the development, the Ministry of Industry cancelled the previous process last year and started afresh by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in a suitable location within the Kathmandu Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the country's current condition and available resources, the official said. According to officials, more consumer courts will be gradually established in other districts based on financial resources.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up just one consumer court per province would not be practical, as people would have to travel long distances for their cases. Therefore, the draft proposes gradually setting up consumer courts in all districts.A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers often hesitate to get involved in complex court cases, observers believe this has emboldened dishonest traders. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier, and the process will involve fewer hassles.

The proposals are being discussed at the party’s central working committee meeting.The party’s central working committee is scheduled to meet on Sunday to seek a consensus on the proposals. The meeting will approve Thapa’s proposal with some minor changes while Sharma’s paper will be pushed back, to be taken up while amending the constitution, party leaders say. The bone of contention is holding the party’s 15th general convention as per the schedule.During the Mahasamiti meeting in February, General Secretary Gagan Thapa proposed that the party should not forge any political alliance for the 2027 general and provincial elections but should contest the polls on its own.The meeting endorsed the proposal and forwarded it to the central working committee for further consideration and a final decision.At the same meeting, the party’s other general secretary, Bishwa Prakash Sharma, had proposed an ‘exit policy’ for senior leaders, recommending term limits: one term for the [nation’s] President, two terms for prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers.Both Sharma’s and Thapa’s proposals were thoroughly discussed at the party’s central working committee meeting that began on August 7.Many members close to party president Sher Bahadur Deuba opposed Sharma’s ‘exit policy’, and there was considerable dissent over Thapa’s proposal to avoid electoral alliances.The proposals forwarded by the Mahasamiti meeting sparked heated debate in the central working committee. The establishment faction led by Deuba wants to amend the proposals, while Thapa and Sharma want endorsement of their proposals without any changes.To discuss these proposals, the party called a meeting of the central working committee beginning August 7, where the members were sharply divided.In order to seek a common ground and to prevent any dispute, Deuba, the party president, kept on reaching out to top leadership as well as Thapa and Sharma multiple times. On Saturday, too, senior leaders like Bimalendra Nidhi, Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, and others opposed Sharma's proposal saying that a democratic party should not shut the door for competition. However, Sharma has a different take and says people have been frustrated at seeing the same old faces in national politics. Sharma told the Post that since the exit policy is linked with the constitutional provision, it will be discussed during the time of reviewing the constitution and an appropriate decision taken. \"The proposal to limit the prime ministerial job for two terms will be endorsed by Sunday's meeting. This policy decision will be approved by consensus. No matter how famous the prime minister, he or she cannot serve for more than two terms,\" Sharma claimed. In an agreement signed before the formation of the current government, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML have committed to reviewing certain provisions of the constitution, drawing on the lessons from nearly a decade of federal exercise.On Thapa's proposal, Sunday’s meeting will decide that all of the party's supporters and well-wishers will vote for the party's symbol \"tree\" in the next elections without mentioning electoral alliances. However, leaders close to Deuba say that decisions on electoral alliances are strategic and should be left until the election time. Thapa's proposal will be approved with amendments, said Shyam Ghimire, the chief whip of the party. Sharma’s proposal will be kept as it is and will be raised during the time of constitutional amendments. Both general secretaries have established their agendas in the party, a central committee member said. The debate has generated good response inside and outside the party.Both general secretaries have also put enough pressure on Deuba to ensure that the party's upcoming 15th general convention should convene on time.During the central working committee meeting in February, Thapa had proposed holding the 15th general convention on schedule—or by mid-December 2025. The general convention elects the party new leadership. Thapa has already proposed a timeline for the general convention, but the party has yet to take a decision.The 14th general convention was held in December 2021. The party charter gives each elected body a tenure of four years. But if the general convention could not occur within four years, the charter provisions a one-year extension. Further, Nepal’s constitution authorises a six-month deferral if a situation of emergency makes holding the convention difficult.At the central working committee meeting, Congress members were divided on whether to amend and approve the proposal or reject it outright. Deuba has been talking to Congress office bearers over the last few days, but there has been no progress. “Now we cannot wait beyond Sunday as the party has to gear up for several other works,” Congress leaders said. ","summary":"Top Nepali Congress leadership has decided to declare truce over the proposals of two party general secretaries—Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma—at least for the time being.A meeting of the present and former Congress office bearers on Saturday decided to take a mid-way approach to the two proposals that Thapa and Sharma presented during the Mahasamiti meeting in February.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” ","summary":"The rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers.

Banks are awash with liquidity. The foreign exchange reserve is at an all-time high. Interest rates have come down. Credit has started to pick up. The stock market is green, mostly. The country has a powerful government of the two biggest parties. Despite several positive indicators, the country’s overall economy is still in a “slowdown” mode.“We have to admit these facts,” said Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel, while addressing the 26th general assembly of the Society of Economic Journalists Nepal on Sunday.“There is no demand in the market. Consumer confidence is low. Investors are hesitant to invest. There is no proper utilisation of liquidity,” he said. He urged the private sector not to complain and move ahead hand-in-hand.Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari said there is some optimism after the slowdown.“We expect the growth outlook to improve with resilient consumption and investment. Nepal’s economy has proved unexpectedly resilient.”The country’s economy suffered multiple setbacks, starting with supply-chain disruptions in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, a considerable surge in inflation triggered by Russia’s war on Ukraine, unstable politics or frequent changes in government. These factors have driven young people to try their luck abroad.It followed a globally synchronised monetary policy tightening in the last fiscal year.“Now the situation is better,” said Adhikari. “We have predicted the economy will recover this year.The external sector is good, inflation is down, and the banking system has adequate liquidity.“As a result, the central bank’s monetary policy had transitioned to an “easing, cautious” mode to address the demand of the private sector, which drives economic growth,” said Adhikari.“We have brought down the interest rate, including the policy rate, just to revitalise the market activities. The credit mobilisation is growing.” For example, according to Adhikari, the ongoing NADA Auto Show has shown the economy is moving in a positive direction. “Our objective is to instil hope and raise the morale of the private sector.”The central bank said the measures to cut interest rates are intended to boost market liquidity and support economic activity in a low-inflation environment.The monetary policy has reduced the upper ceiling interest rate corridor by 0.5 percentage points to 6.5 percent, and the policy rate has been reduced by 0.5 percent to 5 percent.According to market analysts, people tend to invest if banks’ interest rates are low. This will allow liquidity injections in the market without being absorbed by the banks and the central bank.The monetary policy stated that the high liquidity in the banking system would support businesses and individuals and ease the difficulties of the private sector.The central bank said mobilising the banks’ liquidity through the private sector would support the federal government’s ambitious 6 percent economic growth target.Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries, said that the slowed growth resulted from subdued demand. “For the last three years, we saw stalled growth. But now, there is optimism and hope that the economy will grow.”He said that remittance earnings have increased to a record high, and the foreign exchange reserve is also at a historic high.“But if we see the trade—both import and export—are decreasing. This suggests that the demand has not increased. And without the demand, Nepal’s economy cannot grow.”For a country like Nepal, capital expenditure, the government investment, is crucial to revitalising the economy.“If the capital expenditure remains the same as in the past, the economy will remain the same as we observed for the last few years.”Experts say that the recent increase in the cost of living has been one of the significant challenges facing the economy over the past two years. Overall, inflation is decreasing, but consumer confidence still has not increased, which is reflected in the market.“We think the intervention by the government to make market activities vibrant is not enough. We have to look for other measures, too,” said Paudel, stating that without the support of the private sector, the government alone cannot boost the economy.  ","summary":"Nepal’s inflation is slowing almost as quickly as it rose. Banks are awash with liquidity. The foreign exchange reserve is at an all-time high. Interest rates have come down. Credit has started to pick up. The stock market is green, mostly. The country has a powerful government of the two biggest parties. Despite several positive indicators, the country’s overall economy is still in a “slowdown” mode.“We have to admit these facts,” said Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel, while addressing the 26th general assembly of the Society of Economic Journalists Nepal on Sunday.“There is no demand in the market.

Harnessing waste biomass could cut the country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption, according to the paper entitled ‘Possibilities and challenges for converting waste biomass into fuel, feed, and fertiliser in Nepal’.Most of Nepal’s waste biomass is used conventionally, such as for kitchen fuel and animal feed, without proper valorisation. This is a pressing issue as open dumping and burning, particularly of municipal waste, is a common practice in Nepal, according to the paper, with detrimental effects on the overall ecosystem.“Our study estimates the potential of about 89 million tonnes of waste biomass annually in Nepal, mainly from the agriculture, municipal, livestock, fowl, and human sectors,” said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.“We have revealed the potential at the sub-national level in Nepal, highlighting its possibilities and challenges for converting the fuel, feed, and fertilisers,” said Kafle, who is currently pursuing PhD at Auburn University, US.The paper estimates that through the conversion of waste biomass, Nepal can produce about 1.7 to 5.0 million tonnes of pellet or briquette and biochar, 1.7 to 5.1 million tonnes of feed block, 129 to 387 million cubic metres of biogas, and 0.6 to 1.9 million tonnes of fertiliser.“These valuable products can have significant environmental and economic benefits,” the paper said.Waste biomass is generated from different sources, such as forestry residue, agriculture crop residue, municipal organic waste, and livestock waste. Improper management of such residue and waste negatively impacts overall biodiversity, a growing global concern. For example, the poor handling and management of municipal solid waste, mainly generated from the urban sector, pollutes the surroundings and impacts overall biodiversity, including human health. Its management is one of the significant challenges for the relevant authorities, as it needs resources.Municipal solid waste, comprising more than half of organic waste in developing countries, is being dumped and burned openly in Nepal.Similarly, open burning of crop residues, especially paddy straw, is practised in Nepal, resulting in air pollution. This practice is particularly prominent in the Tarai, where combined harvesters scatter straw across the fields, making collection impractical. Farmers often burn the straw as they find it economically unviable to collect and meet the next cropping season. Livestock manures generate methane during decomposition, contributing to global warming. However, anaerobic digestion technology could trap and utilise this gas as energy.Also, improper management of human waste—urine and faeces—pollutes soil and groundwater, affecting human health. Although the country has declared itself free from open defecation, dumping raw sewage and septic tank waste into rivers is common in Nepal. Due to the lack of proper conversion knowledge and technology and the unavailability of status data, the waste biomass is improperly managed or conventionally used in many developing countries. The conventional use of waste biomass is less efficient, hazardous to the environment, and does not generate economic growth. For example, using dry dung cake instead of biogas for cooking fuel is less efficient, degrades indoor air quality, and impacts human health. The lack of data generation, consumption, and availability hinders policymaking and planning for the biomass-based industry.Some houses also have toilets connected to biogas plants. In the fiscal year 2020-21 alone, about 3,975 biogas plants were installed in Nepal. This shows that waste biomass is utilised in modern ways, such as producing biogas. However, the majority is still untapped and is conventionally used or managed poorly.Proper utilisation of such waste biomass needs quantification at the subnational level, which will help develop innovative industries for sustainable development, such as by enhancing the local economy, creating jobs and increasing the share of renewable energy.The study’s findings are significant and show enormous waste potential in the Tarai, especially in Morang district of Koshi Province. Prof Sushil Adhikari, co-author of the study and professor at Auburn University, highlighted the opportunities for producing fuel, feed, and fertilisers from such waste biomass. “The pellets and briquettes produced from waste biomass could effectively replace coal in thermal power industries such as brick and cement. It can reduce the country’s carbon dioxide emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption.” He elaborated on the benefits of producing a densified total mixed ration using crop residue. “In Nepal, where mass transport systems are lacking, and transport costs are high, such densified feed blocks could be a game changer in feed industries.” Further, biogas from waste biomass could reduce the dependency on imported LPG fuel and produce nutrient-rich fertilisers as by-products.“The country lacks location-specific data on the potential and availability of waste biomass, which is important for planning waste-based industries,” said Prajal Pradhan, the co-author of the study and assistant professor at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. Pradhan highlighted lack of mass transport infrastructures and networks and the challenges due to the topography and terrain, which create difficulties in transporting raw materials and final products. “Uncertainty in investment and market, insufficient management regulations and policies, and poor intersectoral coordination are added problems.

It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure.

Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure.

Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death.

The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.

Her newborn baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital due to health complications, and the mother was under care in the maternity ward.“We had to start her on anti-depressants, as she was showing serious symptoms, including suicidal thoughts,” said Dr Pratikshya Ghimire, a psychiatrist at the hospital. “She felt sad all the time, worried about the newborn's future, and had lost her appetite.” Mental health problems during pregnancy are the second leading cause of maternal deaths, after excessive bleeding during childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia [pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with most cases occurring during pregnancy.To address mental health problems during pregnancy, the Ministry of Health and Population has started outpatient care services at the Maternity Hospital.“We have not only started outpatient care but also begun screening inpatients for mental health conditions,” said Dr Ghimire. “We have diagnosed around a dozen and a half patients with serious mental health problems.”According to Dr Ghimire, the woman had an inter-caste marriage, and neither her in-laws nor her own parents accepted her marriage, contributing to her mental health struggles. Several other pregnant women and new mothers have also been found suffering from mental health problems, each at various stages of severity.“The Health Ministry had deputed one psychiatric doctor to our hospital, and we started offering outpatient services after her arrival,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, the hospital's director. “We are also working on training all hospital staff in mental health screening so that conditions can be diagnosed early. Once mental health problems are identified, patients can be referred to specialists.”Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and providing prompt treatment will help reduce maternal deaths, which have been rising alarmingly of late.Doctors say prenatal and postnatal depression can occur at any time during pregnancy or after childbirth. Shifts in hormone levels during pregnancy and after childbirth can significantly affect mood. Many women feel anxious about changes happening to their bodies. Some may even have financial concerns and some worry about taking on new and additional responsibilities.Some women experience extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, and changes in sleeping and eating habits during pregnancy or after childbirth. Experts warn that prenatal and postnatal depression along with anxiety and other mental health issues, can lead some women to take their own lives.They also emphasise that excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), and suicide are preventable. “Timely screening for mental health problems and proper counselling can significantly reduce the mental health problems faced by pregnant women and new mothers,” said Adhikari. “We have launched this initiative at our hospital, and this is something other hospitals should also implement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016. For this, the country also received a Millennium Development Goals award. The 2021 census report showed that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications.

Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” ","summary":"Dusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant.

In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  "},{"hash":"a90b9db6c3c38cf48a1d63805bc18a62428b153ecbe76daccdb8010d4b8e3b5d","title":"this-summer-i-saw-the-everest-up-close","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2024/06/23/this-summer-i-saw-the-everest-up-close","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/main-1719107987.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719100800000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask.

Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it.

The direction is the correct one,” the 44-year-old Italian said.Isak hands Newcastle 2-1 victory over wasteful Tottenham Newcastle United’s striker Alexander Isak secured a 2-1 win against Tottenham Hotspur with a simple tap-in as they weathered a second-half storm from the visitors to secure the points in an entertaining Premier League clash at St James’ Park on Sunday.Harvey Barnes’ first-half opener for Newcastle was cancelled out by a Dan Burn own goal after the break as Spurs dominated the chances in the second period but spurned numerous openings and were beaten by a lightning-quick break from the hosts.Joelinton’s defence-splitting pass was perfect for Jacob Murphy who, after drawing out keeper Guglielmo Vicario, laid the ball on a plate for Isak to secure the three points for manager Eddie Howe’s side, who remain unbeaten at home since January.Adding to Newcastle’s delight, their Italian midfielder Sandro Tonali made his first league appearance since being handed a 10-month ban for a breach of betting rules and received a rapturous reception from the home supporters.Newcastle now have seven points from their first three games, while Tottenham remain on four.Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou was left to rue the scoreline but not the performance as his side had complete control of the contest for long periods.Isak struck the woodwork with an early chance before Newcastle took the lead against the run of play after 37 minutes.A quick throw-in allowed Lloyd Kelly to fire in a low cross from the left which was superbly guided into the far corner by Barnes.The visitors levelled when Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope failed to deal with a James Maddison shot and pushed the ball to Brennan Johnson, whose effort was cleared into his own net by Burn.Tottenham continued to pepper the Newcastle goal but it was the hosts who found the winner thanks to the vision of Joelinton and the composure of Murphy to set up Sweden international Isak.Man Utd humbled as Diaz double helps Liverpool humiliate rivals Two goals from Luis Diaz and one from Mohamed Salah helped Liverpool stroll to a 3-0 victory at Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday, with Erik ten Hag’s side humbled by their fierce rivals.Liverpool dominated a United team who could not keep pace with them in the first half, the visitors taking the lead in the 35th minute through a back-post header from Diaz after United midfielder Casemiro had given the ball away.Casemiro was again at fault for Diaz and Liverpool’s second, again supplied by Mohamed Salah, with the Colombia international sweeping home three minutes before the break, sending United supporters off for their halftime refreshments early.With United on the ropes, Liverpool smelled blood after the break, Salah adding a third 11 minutes into the second half, but the visitors settled for three as they maintained their 100% record this season under new coach Arne Slot.“The goals are always self-inflicted,” United captain Bruno Fernandes told Sky Sports. “When you concede a goal you can't just point at one mistake. We don’t have to look at the past. We just have to make it different. We lost the game, congratulations to Liverpool, they were more clinical. I don't look at the stats but the game was tight.”After a positive summer in the transfer market and fresh faces in the boardroom, last week’s last-gasp defeat at Brighton and Hove Albion gave United supporters a stark reminder of the improvements still needed on the pitch.Sunday’s visit of a Liverpool side who had lost just one of their previous 12 Premier League meetings with United will have caused a great deal of concern pre-match.Those more pessimistic fans were fearing the worst as Trent Alexander-Arnold appeared to have fired Liverpool into an early lead at Old Trafford, only for VAR to step in and save the hosts, adjudging Salah to be offside earlier in the move.United settled into the contest without troubling Liverpool down the other end of the pitch, allowing the visitors to pick their moments when they came.Casemiro’s wayward pass ensured the Slot's side did not have to try too hard to unlock their rivals, Diaz applying the finishing touch to get Liverpool up and running.Diaz’s third of the season was another fine finish, but another Casemiro will want to forget. The flying Liverpool forward has now scored more Premier League goals against United than any other opponent.Yet another mistake in midfield, this time from Kobbie Mainoo, was ruthlessly punished by Salah in the second half, the Egyptian cementing his pace as the highest-scoring opposition player at Old Trafford in Premier League history — seven strikes.The visitors thereafter cruised to a victory that means Slot is the first Liverpool manager to win his first meeting with United since Bob Paisley in November 1975, and just the second to do so away from home after George Kay in November 1936.

It’s a tough one to take.Watkins was denied by Leicester keeper Mads Hermansen in the first period but was involved in Villa’s opener.The closest Leicester came to an equaliser in the first half was a bundled effort by Caleb Okoli that almost surprised Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez.Leicester were better after the break and had the ball in the net when Oliver Skipp crossed for Jamie Vardy to steer in a shot but the referee David Coote had already blown the whistle after he played an inadvertent part in the build-up.Duran’s beautifully guided header from Lucas Digne’s cross doubled Villa’s lead but when substitute Buonanotte struck for the hosts it set some nerves jangling in the visitors’ ranks.Vardy twice went down looking for penalties but was rightly not rewarded despite the howls of protest around the ground.Cooper was critical of the standard of refereeing, not just with the turned down penalties but also with the award of the free kick that led to Villa’s opening goal.“We know where the level of refereeing is now. We’ve known for a number of years. We just need to take a step back and say ‘this is how it is’,” Cooper said.Brighton end 10-man Arsenal’s winning start with 1-1 draw Brighton and Hove Albion ended Arsenal’s winning start to the new Premier League season with a 1-1 draw at The Emirates on Saturday, with the home side holding on with 10 men after Declan Rice’s second-half sending-off.Arsenal dominated the first half and deservedly led at halftime after Kai Havertz finished brilliantly in the 38th minute, having been played in expertly by Bukayo Saka.Four minutes into the second half, however, Arsenal’s task was made all the harder when Rice was sent off after picking up a second yellow card. Brazilian striker Joao Pedro fired Brighton level 12 minutes later.Both sides missed golden chances to win the contest late on, but they each had to settle for a point that keeps Arsenal and Brighton unbeaten in their three games so far.Saka could have snatched the win late on, while Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya had to be at his best on several occasions to keep Brighton from earning all three points, but both seemed content with a draw after an exhilarating tussle.“We didn’t create enough chances when they went down to 10 men, but we will go away and look at it,” Brighton captain Lewis Dunk said.Bellegarde stunner earns Wolves first point at Forest Jean-Ricner Bellegarde’s stunning strike earned Wolverhampton Wanderers their first point of the Premier League season with a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest on Saturday.In a frantic start to the game, New Zealand striker Chris Wood headed the hosts into a 10th-minute lead from a corner, having been left completely unmarked in the penalty area.Bellegarde issued an immediate response, however, lashing home a sensational hit two minutes later.Both sides failed to create clearcut chances to snatch all three points as Forest remained unbeaten this season.Each of the last four league games between Forest and Wolves have now ended in draws, the most in succession during this fixture’s history. It is also the same number of stalemates as across their 20 league meetings combined.“It was a poor goal from us to concede but we were able to bounce back,” Wolves boss Gary O’Neil told the BBC.Ipswich secured first point of season in draw with Fulham A first-half goal from Liam Delap earned Ipswich their first Premier League point of the season, but they had to share the spoils in a 1-1 home draw with Fulham on Saturday after winger Adama Traore grabbed an equaliser.Following successive losses to Manchester City and Liverpool, the home side got off the mark as Marco Silva’s Fulham followed up their win over Leicester City with another strong performance.Roared on by an enthusiastic home crowd, Delap put Ipswich ahead in the 15th minute, drifting across the box before lashing in a powerful shot that Fulham keeper Bernd Leno got his gloves to but could not keep out.The visitors levelled 17 minutes later after Antonee Robinson whipped the ball across the box and Traore stabbed it home with a superb first-time finish to crown Fulham’s best attack of the game.Fulham’s Robinson went in the book just before the hour mark for dragging down Chiedozie Ogbene and both sides showed plenty of aggression, especially at set pieces.Delap almost teed Ogbene up for a second goal for Ipswich in the 68th minute but his pass that sliced through the middle of the Fulham defence was slightly too hard, and Leno beat the winger to the ball.Fulham’s best chances came on the counter and Raul Jimenez forced a fine save from Arijanet Muric as the clock ticked up towards 90 minutes.Winger Omari Hutchinson almost capped a man-of-the-match display for Ipswich with a stoppage-time goal, but again Leno was equal to the task.Mbeumo doubles as Brentford eases past Southampton Bryan Mbeumo’s double and a goal by Yoane Wissa earned Brentford a comfortable 3-1 home win over promoted Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday.Brentford, who beat Crystal Palace 2-1 in their season opener but lost to Liverpool 2-0 last weekend, moved up to fifth on six points while Southampton are 19th and still without a point.“They made errors because we pressed them unbelievably well,” Brentford coach Thomas Frank told the BBC.Mbeumo put the hosts in front just before halftime with a simple low finish, following up on Kevin Schade’s strike which bounced off the post.He doubled the advantage in the 65th minute with a first-time shot into the bottom corner of the net.Brentford profited from another defensive error by Southampton, who lost the ball just outside the box and Mathias Jensen played in Mbeumo with a precise pass for his third goal in three Premier League games.“It was a great team performance today,” said Mbeumo. “We stuck to the plan the gaffer gave us and it worked perfectly.”Wissa bundled the ball in past Southampton keeper Aaron Ramsdale in the 69th, making it 3-0 after Nathan Collins headed the ball on from near the back line following a throw-in.Ramsdale started for Southampton one day after finalising a four-year deal from Arsenal.Southampton made two attacking substitutions at halftime, introducing striker Cameron Archer and midfielder Mateus Fernandes but they managed only two shots on target after the break.Defender Yukinari Sugawara scored a consolation goal in stoppage time for the visitors, who lost their first three games of a league season for the first time since 2012-13.Bournemouth stun Everton with last-gasp three-goal salvo Bournemouth scored three late goals to stun Everton 3-2 in the Premier League at Goodison Park on Saturday and leave the hosts without a point from three matches.Everton, under pressure after two league losses, opened up a 2-0 lead in a seven-minute spell after the breakthrough goals from Michael Keane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.Bournemouth spent most of the game on the back foot, barely threatening the Everton goal, but with three minutes left they pulled a goal back when Antoine Semenyo poked home from close range.In added time, Lewis Cook’s powerful header found the back of the net and Luis Sinisterra broke Everton hearts with the winner to leave Everton rooted to the bottom of the table.“You have to kill teams off at every level, but particularly at this level,” Everton manager Sean Dyche said.The sun shone on Goodison, with the fans in fine voice despite their side’s dismal start to the season but the opening half brought little in the way of chances.That all changed five minutes after the interval when Calvert-Lewin chested the ball down to Keane who drilled a low shot past keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, and seven minutes later it looked all over for Bournemouth.Dwight McNeil slid the perfect ball into the path of Calvert-Lewin who slotted his shot over the onrushing Kepa and it looked as though Bournemouth would suffer their first league defeat of the season.Instead, however, Everton managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, conceding three goals in quick succession to undo all of their good work.Dango Ouattara’s cross across the goal found Semenyo at the back post to pull one back and Bournemouth looked set for a third successive Premier League draw when an unmarked Cook met Sinisterra’s cross and powered his header beyond Jordan Pickford.The game was deep into added time when Justin Kluivert sent a cross into the area and Sinisterra lost his markers to head home the winner and move Bournemouth up to seventh in the standings on five points.“It was the worst game we played this season. We had been playing very well before but Everton deserved to win today,” Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said.

the bottom of the table.“You have to kill teams off at every level, but particularly at this level,” Everton manager Sean Dyche said.The sun shone on Goodison, with the fans in fine voice despite their side’s dismal start to the season but the opening half brought little in the way of chances.That all changed five minutes after the interval when Calvert-Lewin chested the ball down to Keane who drilled a low shot past keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, and seven minutes later it looked all over for Bournemouth.Dwight McNeil slid the perfect ball into the path of Calvert-Lewin who slotted his shot over the onrushing Kepa and it looked as though Bournemouth would suffer their first league defeat of the season.Instead, however, Everton managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, conceding three goals in quick succession to undo all of their good work.Dango Ouattara’s cross across the goal found Semenyo at the back post to pull one back and Bournemouth looked set for a third successive Premier League draw when an unmarked Cook met Sinisterra’s cross and powered his header beyond Jordan Pickford.The game was deep into added time when Justin Kluivert sent a cross into the area and Sinisterra lost his markers to head home the winner and move Bournemouth up to seventh in the standings on five points.“It was the worst game we played this season. We had been playing very well before but Everton deserved to win today,” Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said.

The dream that I saw when I was 10 years old finally came true,” she said after the historic victory.“This medal is not just for me but for the entire country. “It was a really tough match… and I was very nervous. When the bout against Micev was going even at 7-7, 8-8, I thought about the Tokyo Paralympics. I did not want to repeat the last Olympics’ miss so I gathered myself together and started scoring kick-after-kick in the final 10 seconds. Finally I did it…. I won the historic medal for Nepal.”Goverdhan also became the first Nepali athlete to win a medal at an Olympic level.Nepal has never won an official medal at the Summer Games in its 60-year long Olympic history—not considering Bidhan Lama’s bronze in the exhibition taekwondo event at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the gold presented to Tejbir Bura at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France for his alpinism effort as part of the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition. Neither medal was officially recognised by the International Olympic Committee.Nepal made its Paralympics Games debut at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, sending Nirmala Gyawali in the women’s shot-put event. Jit Bahadur Khadka was the second athlete to participate at the Paralympic Games. He competed in the men's 100m at 2008 Summer Paralympics.“It feels surreal because back home no one imagines Nepal winning a medal on the world stage. But I have done it… my team has done it. Hopefully, this historic moment will help change the situation for all the para-athletes in Nepal,” added Goverdhan.“There are many talented para-athletes in Nepal. If they get more resources and exposure, many medals will come in the future,” she said. The 21-year-old para taekwondo athlete Goverdhan, who appeared in her second successive Paralympics, finally got the reward after coming ever so close to a historic bronze at the Tokyo Paralympics three years ago.Goverdhan, who entered Tokyo Paralympic Games on a wildcard, won two repechage events to enter the bronze medal final but lost to China’s Li Yujie in the women’s 58kg K44 in the bronze medal final in Tokyo, finishing fifth.\"It was my first Paralympics,” recalled Goverdhan. “I was just 18 at that time. I was still a novice. I felt really bad when I missed out on bronze. When you lose, you just don’t want to see yourself crying. But I knew. It happened once, and it will never happen again.”Goverdhan has only gotten better over time.Two years later, at the Asian Para Games 2022 in Hangzhou, China, Goverdhan etched her name in history books by becoming the first Nepali athlete to win a medal at the Asian Para Games. Goverdhan defeated China’s Yang Li Ting 14-1 to enter the semi-finals that assured her at least a bronze medal.Following Nepal’s another poor showing at the Paris Summer Games which took place from July 26 to August 11, hopes of an Olympic medal for the country solely rested on Goverdhan. She became the first Nepali paralympian to qualify for the Paralympic Games following her victory over Iran’s Leila Mirzae in the final of the Asian Qualification Tournament in Taiyang, China.Goverdhan did not disappoint. In Paris, she defeated Valeria Morales of Venezuela 31-0 in the round of 16 to progress to the quarter-finals. She lost to Tokyo Paralympics bronze medallist Silvana Fernandes of Brazil 8-10 in the last eight but clawed her way back to defeat Sophie Caverzan of France 2-1 in the repechage contest to set up the bronze medal final against Micev.“Everyone believed in my capacity and expected a medal from me. I am really grateful for all those who had faith in me. I am happy that I am finally able to give this Paralympic medal as a gift in return,” said Goverdhan.“I want to thank my parents, my coach, Nepal Taekwondo Association, Paralympic Committee, National Sports Council and all my supporters.”Following the victory, her coaches raced onto the mat and draped a Nepal flag around Goverdhan in celebration of the historic moment.Goverdhan and Nepal’s taekwondo team had trained in Manchester, England for a month before heading to Paris.“This is a victory for all Nepali people and the country. We have finally won a medal in the Paralympic Games after getting so close in Tokyo. I am really proud of Palesha… and thanks to her parents and associations who supported her struggle,” said her coach Kabi Raj Negi Lama who has now won his 11th international medal as coach.“This success was possible because of the effort of Palesha and the entire team. Palesha has given a message that Nepal is also capable of winning medals at the Olympics,” added Lama. Goverdhan’s bronze medal final victory over the Serbian was her fifth overall match victory in the Paralympic Games—a feat no Nepali athlete has achieved either at the Summer Games or the Summer Paralympics.The bronze, you could say, was inevitable given her steady progress in international competitions.Born without a left palm, the 21-year-old Goverdhan started practising taekwondo at the age of 10. She became part of the national para taekwondo team in 2016 and made her international debut during the Asian Open Para Taekwondo Championship in Chuncheon, South Korea, where she finished fifth.Goverdhan also won gold in the Second Kathmandu Gyarogi and Poomsae International Taekwondo Competition 2018, and Asian Youth Para Games 2021 in Bahrain. She is also a bronze medallist of the Fourth Asian Para Taekwondo held in 2018 Vietnam.Goverdhan will get Rs6.5 million cash prize for his historic bronze, as provisioned in the National Sports Development Regulation 2022.She was rewarded with Rs 1.3 million for winning bronze at the Asian Para Games in Hangzhou.Her coach will receive Rs 5,085,000, manager will bag Rs 2,092,000 and the concerned sports association will get Rs 1.17 million.National Sports Council Member Secretary Tanka Lal Ghising congratulated Goverdhan “for giving Nepali sports and the nation a valuable gift”.Meanwhile, Nepal’s Bharat Singh Mahata crashed out of the Paris Paralympics on Thursday after he lost his men’s K44 under 58 kg round of 16 match of the taekwondo competition against Mitsuya Tanaka of Japan 3-19.Para swimmer Bhim Bahadur Kumal will compete in the men’s 50m freestyle Heat on Monday.

It promised public hospitals better security equipment, female guards to support female physicians and controlled entry points, according to an internal government memo seen by Reuters.None of these measures had been implemented at the public hospital where a young female doctor was sexually assaulted and killed on Aug. 9, allegedly by a police volunteer, four trainee doctors there told Reuters.Instead, in the days leading up to the homicide-assault, which prompted nationwide outrage and a doctors strike, only two male guards manned R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital, they said. They were supplemented by a few closed circuit cameras that did not comprehensively cover the sprawling premises, according to the trainees.One of the doors of the lecture hall where the doctor had been resting during a 36-hour shift when she was attacked had no lock, said two other trainee doctors who had also slept there. The air conditioning in the designated break room had malfunctioned, they said.After two doctors at a different hospital were assaulted by a patient’s relatives in 2019, West Bengal had promised to install “effective security equipment and systems,” regulate entry and exit to hospital premises and create a compensation policy for assaulted staff, according to the state health department memo dated June 17, 2019.The two-page document, which is reported by Reuters for the first time, was prepared after chief minister Mamata Banerjee met that day with trainee doctors protesting the attack on their colleagues as a “record note” of the interaction. The memo did not state to whom it was addressed.Banerjee had directed officials to take “effective and prompt” action “within a specified timeframe,” according to the document. It did not detail the preparation period.“If those measures had been taken, this incident may never have happened,” said Dr Riya Bera, a postgraduate trainee at R.G. Kar, of her colleague’s death.Asked by Reuters about the 2019 assurances, West Bengal Health Secretary N S Nigam said the COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted improvements for two years but “a lot” had been done since 2021, including strengthening CCTV coverage and engaging private security in hospitals.“We are committed to do the remaining work and fill the gaps that emerged after the R.G. Kar incident,” he said.Banerjee on Aug. 28 also announced that $12 million would be spent to begin work on improvements such as better lighting in health facilities, resting spaces and female security staff.The chief minister’s office, as well as R.G. Kar hospital, did not respond to calls seeking comment.Authorities continue to investigate the Aug. 9 incident, for which no charges have yet been filed.‘Patriarchal attitudes and biases’The assault on the doctor in Kolkata, who cannot be named under local laws, recalled memories of the 2012 gang rape of a physiotherapist in a Delhi bus, which convulsed India in anger and triggered protests.Reuters interviewed 14 female doctors at government hospitals in West Bengal and elsewhere in India about their challenges in a country where women’s safety is a long-standing concern.They described poor working conditions, including aggressive treatment from the families of patients and having to sleep on benches in dimly-lit corridors due to a lack of rest facilities.Some doctors spoke of napping in break rooms with no locks during lengthy shifts, only to have people barging in. Others described confronting male patients who photographed them without permission, claiming that they were documenting evidence of their treatment.Indian Medical Association (IMA) President RV Asokan told Reuters that while the Aug. 9 homicide-assault appeared to be unique in its brutality, “the fact that anybody can walk in shows the vulnerability of the place, and this when more and more women are joining the profession.”Some doctors have taken self-defense measures: One doctor at a hospital in Odisha state, which neighbours West Bengal, said her father gave her a knife to ward off potential attackers.And Dr Gauri Seth, a post graduate trainee at Medical College, Kolkata, told Reuters that after the Aug 9. incident, she would not go on duty again without carrying a pepper spray or scalpel to defend herself.About 60% of India’s doctors are female, and three-quarters of them have described being victims of verbal abuse, physical attacks and other harassment while on duty, according to the IMA, the nation’s largest group of physicians.“Due to ingrained patriarchal attitudes and biases, relatives of patients are more likely to challenge women medical professionals...(they) also face different forms of sexual violence at the workplace,” India’s Supreme Court wrote in a Aug. 20 ruling ordering the creation of a taskforce on medical workers’ safety.India introduced tough laws governing crimes against women following the 2012 Delhi gang rape, including expanding the definition of rape to include all penetration without consent, as well as criminalizing voyeurism and stalking.But the situation remains bleak, according to activists and government data.Almost 450,000 crimes against women were reported in 2022 - the most recent year for which data is available - up 4% on 2021, government data show. More than 7% of the alleged crimes were rape-related.Lawyer and rights activist Vrinda Grover blamed inadequate training for police investigators and broader cultural issues.“What is very disturbing in this case is the ordinariness of what the victim was doing: she was in her workplace,” she said. “There is something wrong with a society where such conduct is so commonplace.”Living her dreamThe 31-year Kolkata physician, whose battered, half-naked body was found by colleagues, had always wanted to be a doctor, family members and friends told Reuters.“When I bumped into her last year, she told me she was very happy and was living her dream,” said Somojit Moulik, who had studied with the victim in medical school.When Reuters visited the victim’s family home, the nameplate bore only her name with the prefix Dr, in an indication of how highly her relatives valued her achievements.Her aunt said in an interview that her niece had been set to marry a physician she had studied with later this year, and that she had not complained about safety issues at work.But in the wake of her death, colleagues are speaking out. Dr Shreya Shaw, a postgraduate trainee at R.G. Kar hospital, said she found two strangers shaking her awake at around 3 a.m. when she was sleeping in a designated rest room, which did not have locks.“It was initially quite scary to wake up to unknown men in the dark,” she said, adding that she was shocked the patients could enter the floor where she was resting without being stopped.

Others described confronting male patients who photographed them without permission, claiming that they were documenting evidence of their treatment.Indian Medical Association (IMA) President RV Asokan told Reuters that while the Aug. 9 homicide-assault appeared to be unique in its brutality, “the fact that anybody can walk in shows the vulnerability of the place, and this when more and more women are joining the profession.”Some doctors have taken self-defense measures: One doctor at a hospital in Odisha state, which neighbours West Bengal, said her father gave her a knife to ward off potential attackers.And Dr Gauri Seth, a post graduate trainee at Medical College, Kolkata, told Reuters that after the Aug 9. incident, she would not go on duty again without carrying a pepper spray or scalpel to defend herself.About 60% of India’s doctors are female, and three-quarters of them have described being victims of verbal abuse, physical attacks and other harassment while on duty, according to the IMA, the nation’s largest group of physicians.“Due to ingrained patriarchal attitudes and biases, relatives of patients are more likely to challenge women medical professionals...(they) also face different forms of sexual violence at the workplace,” India’s Supreme Court wrote in a Aug. 20 ruling ordering the creation of a taskforce on medical workers’ safety.India introduced tough laws governing crimes against women following the 2012 Delhi gang rape, including expanding the definition of rape to include all penetration without consent, as well as criminalizing voyeurism and stalking.But the situation remains bleak, according to activists and government data.Almost 450,000 crimes against women were reported in 2022 - the most recent year for which data is available - up 4% on 2021, government data show. More than 7% of the alleged crimes were rape-related.Lawyer and rights activist Vrinda Grover blamed inadequate training for police investigators and broader cultural issues.“What is very disturbing in this case is the ordinariness of what the victim was doing: she was in her workplace,” she said. “There is something wrong with a society where such conduct is so commonplace.”Living her dreamThe 31-year Kolkata physician, whose battered, half-naked body was found by colleagues, had always wanted to be a doctor, family members and friends told Reuters.“When I bumped into her last year, she told me she was very happy and was living her dream,” said Somojit Moulik, who had studied with the victim in medical school.When Reuters visited the victim’s family home, the nameplate bore only her name with the prefix Dr, in an indication of how highly her relatives valued her achievements.Her aunt said in an interview that her niece had been set to marry a physician she had studied with later this year, and that she had not complained about safety issues at work.But in the wake of her death, colleagues are speaking out. Dr Shreya Shaw, a postgraduate trainee at R.G. Kar hospital, said she found two strangers shaking her awake at around 3 a.m. when she was sleeping in a designated rest room, which did not have locks.“It was initially quite scary to wake up to unknown men in the dark,” she said, adding that she was shocked the patients could enter the floor where she was resting without being stopped.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) ","summary":"Nepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market.

But soon they met Prakash, or Paka, a shadow figure living in oblivion for over three decades in the valley after being lost from Kathmandu. He had only hazy memories of his family and home in Jhapa, and his real name—Kale Tamang. The Herne Katha team soon began tracing his footsteps back to Jhapa. Along the journey, Paka’s memories of his childhood, his family and his home came back alive in bits and pieces. Ultimately, he found his family back—in Jhapa, where his sisters lived, and in Bhojpur, where his parents and brothers had resettled. On the eighth day of its premiere, as “The Lost Years” had reached 8.7 million views on YouTube, Paka had risen as a folk hero and the Herne Katha team garnered accolades and criticisms aplenty. A curious mixture of his destiny and Herne Katha’s storytelling helped him find home. But long after Herne Katha stopped rolling, his story continues to unravel. From a story, he is slowly metamorphosing into a content as he is being pushed towards uncharted territories. The return from social media-fed stardom to reality is rather troublesome and tragic—as we have seen in the case of the young Sachin Pariyar. Known for his quirky humour and mediocre singing, Sachin became an overnight sensation. Soon, his broken family became a feed for content creators; his father, nicknamed Kaloute, became a celebrated villain; and the child was made to beg on the streets of Kathmandu. The estrangementAs Paka metamorphoses into a subject for content creators, he is quickly losing the plot of his story. As YouTubers seek newness in their content, Paka will be encouraged to fabricate his hardships and seek financial support—things he had hardly ever done before. In no time, having repeated the fabrications on camera umpteen times, he will learn to believe them, even become obsessed with them. Questions about the inconsistencies in his plotline will follow, and he will have to supplement fabrications with lies. In no time, Paka will have lost touch with his story. Unless another good samaritan jumps in to save Paka from the viral infection of social media-driven stardom, this is more or less his trajectory in the next few weeks. There are some tell-tale signs of Paka’s downfall already: His parents have already started crying in front of YouTubers; his brother has already started reciting stale chutkilas; local politicians have offered him land to build a home; provincial and federal government representatives have promised to help him; and the common public have begun garlanding him and offering him money. The man who had mastered the art of living in the mountains will soon be tutored in the art of lying in front of the camera. Negotiating the journey from innocence to experience is often more difficult than spending cold winter nights in the company of yaks and sheep. Finding home should never be accompanied by the loss of self, but that is what happens when the story loses its plot. The spectacleThe history of the media is a story of fabrications. Folklores and myths, poetry and prose, or stories and reels, all depend on some bit of fabrication by the media that bear them—oral, visual, or tactile. The heroes we celebrate or the villains we loathe have all come to us through some sort of fabrications by the media ecosystem. From cave paintings' exaggeration of Neanderthal life to ChatGPT's fabrication about the books this author has not written, media of all forms exist in the interstitial space between truth and falsity. No wonder that Bidhya Chapagain and her Herne Katha team were criticised for \"fabricating\" Paka's story of hardship. Rather than wait for over a year to sell his story, we are told, the makers should have yelled about it into the ears of the authorities—meaning the exploitative system—for punitive action. If nothing, they should have at least asked difficult questions to Paka's master who had kept him without pay for over three decades.In the normative sense of action-oriented journalism, the criticisms against Herne Katha are not unfounded. A deeper probing into what led to Paka's misery would certainly have led to greater accountability from his master and the systems that disallow people like him from finding their way home. But not every story that involves a camera, a voiceover and a character is journalism, much less investigative journalism. Though with backgrounds in journalism, the Herne Katha team, in identifying themselves as storytellers, have not, at least now, made any serious claim to being activist-journalists. Rather, their interest seems to be in bearing witness and telling a good story. Everybody loves a good story, no matter whether it is that of selling dreams or shedding tears. Unless they resort to sensationalism and journalistic grandstanding, a bit of melodrama narrating the bittersweet story of a man lost in the mountains for 30 years is no big deal. But Paka's story is quickly becoming a public spectacle, and there is a risk of him losing his very being.   ","summary":"A year and a half ago, Bidhya Chapagain and her team of Herne Katha (Seeing Stories) visited the distant Chum Valley in Gorkha District to follow the story of Phunjo Lama.

A deeper probing into what led to Paka's misery would certainly have led to greater accountability from his master and the systems that disallow people like him from finding their way home. But not every story that involves a camera, a voiceover and a character is journalism, much less investigative journalism. Though with backgrounds in journalism, the Herne Katha team, in identifying themselves as storytellers, have not, at least now, made any serious claim to being activist-journalists. Rather, their interest seems to be in bearing witness and telling a good story. Everybody loves a good story, no matter whether it is that of selling dreams or shedding tears. Unless they resort to sensationalism and journalistic grandstanding, a bit of melodrama narrating the bittersweet story of a man lost in the mountains for 30 years is no big deal. But Paka's story is quickly becoming a public spectacle, and there is a risk of him losing his very being.   "},{"hash":"fd52235d9573424ba2be2dbb16c1f44997e5d63ce09774108bde9a29f0073e00","title":"dismal-narratives-of-education","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/08/31/dismal-narratives-of-education","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/Leadpostfile-1725074027.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1725062400000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"The dismal narratives of higher education in particular and the education system in general that regularly come out these days make me pensive.

News of political intervention in the smooth process of education and the related practice of obscurantism are quite disturbing. This subject is discussed in responsible media outlets, in the meetings of enlightened minds and in the parliament. Politicians and government leaders bandying about politics and education is particularly worrying. One hears gross negligence of the subtlety that the culture and practice of education cover. First, I want to put the nature of some news and views on this subject.The common themes of the narratives are that the culture of education and its practice are suffering. Imageries of death and funeral for educational karma are used in some articles. The stories of political appointments to fill up some regular educational posts at the university find great publicity. The agencies of this contentious subject mainly come from the two major ruling parties, the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist). The impression I get from reading some news is that this subject, which could be handled easily with prudence, discussion and common sense, is getting out of control. Narratives of physical attacks, fulminations and vengeance are rife.This story of the NC-UML binary in education creates doubt about the honesty and pragmatism in education propagated by political parties. The general public has even begun to question the seriousness of political alliances in bringing a state of order, standard and decency to the educational system. Politicising education through party interference is already established as a hegemonic practice in Nepal. When the Italian thinker Antonio Gramsci used the term hegemony, he had in mind a practice or a state of consciousness that is accepted as a norm across society. And the point is that it becomes pragmatically easier to handle a situation and people by means of that tacit consensus. Division of political nature among the stakeholders, educational administrators, students and political parties that have long adopted the partisan culture for their organisations has created hegemony. The Nepali educational system, especially at the tertiary level, clearly shows this.The other side of realityI have spent most of my life working in the field of pedagogy, research and related engagements at the tertiary level. People like me and those with similar experiences have worked under different conditions of politics and transformations, hopes and obscurantism. I am still working, if not regularly, as a teacher and supervisor of students’ research work. I attend the students' forums and present my views on theories and cultural studies. Some students are doing their PhD under my tutelage. I have a long experience working with students both at and outside the Kirtipur campus. A certain enduring sense of being a teacher under different conditions of inspiration and pragmatism still guides my sense of working in education. Being a politically conscious person and one who worked with political ideologies even as a student in the past, I do not want to sound naïve in politics and education. I am familiar with the works and plans of students who espouse various ideological camps summed up by such nomenclature as the Nepali Congress, UML, Maoists and even the erstwhile Panchayat system.To take one recent and eloquent example, I was watching the news of the launch of a book named Nakabandi ra Bhurajniti, written by my former student Kamal Thapa, with Prime Minister KP Oli as the chief guest the other day. Kamal has penned his experience representing and defending Nepal's new republican constitution at a meeting in Geneva while working as Nepal's foreign minister. He had not even fully accepted the constitution then. I do not agree with Kamal's political ideas, but this example suggests that students' political engagements and teachers' free relationships do not necessarily end with their ideological followings. I have a long experience of this nature. This requires a more extended discussion with theories and experience. As a teacher, I can say that students' political interests and associations are natural. The claims that students have destroyed the education system by their different views are hard to accept. As the news and commentaries criticise, they have not dragged education to a point of no return. We should also see this side of reality: Students write good dissertations, research papers, essays and rhetorical texts; they read books and magazines in print and online. What is harming education is the following.Sometimes, political parties and their leaders encourage students and teachers to espouse a culture that sows the seed of hatred. The other side is a reckless process of filling the university posts and positions on party lines rather than based on merits. It is dismaying that some teachers give credence and encouragement to this culture for perks, positions and parties. Barbaric events of physical assaults show the culmination of the reckless use of politics and partisan culture in education. However, I have recently read that the university authorities are taking measures to promote fairness and transparency in educational management. Hard timesWe are working in the most challenging times for two reasons. First, political parties and their leaders are debating a subject that needs a careful and thoughtful assessment. It is not tenable to say that since teachers and students have made great contributions to politics, their engagement and activism in education are justified. This reflects the arrogance of those leaders and parties and their tendency to integrate party activities within education. The second challenge is the need for prudence, vision and urgency to bring reforms to the existing education system, which is dogged by various problems, including non-educational self-interest. The practice of pedagogy and the culture of research and opening to new realms of knowledge are functioning. Serious teachers, students and researchers are engaged in this.

From the icy wilderness of Alaska to the sunny shores of the Caribbean, these legendary land transactions reveal how strategic decisions shaped the world we know today. Let’s take a journey through some of the largest and most influential real estate deals in history. One of the most significant land purchases ever made was the Alaska Purchase in 1867. In what many at the time deemed a foolish move, the US bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million, which amounted to just two cents per acre.Critics labelled it “Seward’s Folly” after then Secretary of State William H. Seward, who had championed the deal. To most Americans, Alaska was an inhospitable, frozen wasteland with little practical value. However, history would soon reveal how wrong that perception was. Alaska, which eventually became the 49th state of the US, turned out to be rich in resources. Today, the state supplies around 20 percent of the petroleum needed by the US and is home to vast reserves of gold, diamonds and other minerals. Its stunning natural landscapes and abundant wildlife have also made it a top destination for adventure-seeking tourists. The purchase not only secured valuable resources but also expanded America’s influence in the Asia-Pacific region. But why did Russia sell such a vast and resource-rich territory? The answer lies in the aftermath of the Crimean War.Faced with financial strain and the threat of another costly conflict with Britain, Russia decided it was better to sell Alaska than risk losing it in a future war. More than a century later, some Russians still lament this decision, believing Alaska should have remained part of their country. In today’s market, the land alone could be valued at over $37 billion, making it one of the greatest bargains in history. What was once seen as a foolish investment is now considered one of the smartest geopolitical moves ever made. Another colossal real estate deal occurred in 1803, when the US acquired the Louisiana Territory from France.The Louisiana Purchase nearly doubled the size of the young nation, adding approximately 828,000 square miles of land. This massive acquisition was negotiated by President Thomas Jefferson, who saw it as crucial for America’s expansion. The price? A mere $15 million, or roughly four cents per acre. France’s leader at the time, Napoleon Bonaparte, was eager to sell the territory because he needed funds to support his military campaigns in Europe, especially his on-going conflict with Spain. By selling the Louisiana Territory, Napoleon not only gained much-needed revenue but also rid himself of land he considered difficult to defend. For the US, the deal was a strategic game changer. It secured American control over the Mississippi River and paved the way for westward expansion, which would define much of the country’s future.Today, the land acquired in the Louisiana Purchase includes 15 states, from Louisiana in the south to Montana in the north. Its value is now estimated at over $100 billion, making it another historic example of how visionary leadership can transform a nation’s fortunes. While the Alaska and Louisiana purchases are well-known, another historic agreement that shaped global land distribution was the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. This treaty, signed by Spain and Portugal, essentially divided the world between the two rising superpowers.Brokered by the Pope, the agreement drew an imaginary line down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Lands to the west of this line, including most of the Americas, were claimed by Spain, while lands to the east, including parts of Africa and Asia, were designated for Portugal. This division of the world laid the foundation for centuries of exploration, conquest, and colonization by these two nations. Portugal focused on expanding its empire in Africa, India, and Brazil, while Spain’s influence spread across the Americas. The wealth generated from these colonial empires was staggering, built largely on the resources and labour extracted from the lands they controlled.However, by the late 19th century, both empires had begun to crumble as their colonies gained independence or were taken over by other European powers. The treaty that once defined global power dynamics became obsolete as new empires like Britain, France and the US emerged. In the early 20th century, yet another important land deal took place that was driven by strategic considerations.As World War I raged across Europe, the US purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917 for $25 million. President Woodrow Wilson initiated the deal out of concern that Germany might seize control of these islands, which would have posed a serious threat to American national security. The Virgin Islands are strategically located along key maritime routes between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, making them a valuable asset for controlling naval movements in the region. Besides their strategic importance, the Virgin Islands have also become a major tourist destination, boosting the local and national economy.The purchase not only secured America’s presence in the Caribbean but also prevented a potential wartime disaster, proving that sometimes the value of land lies in its location rather than its resources. These monumental real estate transactions reveal some common themes. First, strategic foresight is key. Whether it was acquiring Alaska or purchasing the Louisiana Territory, these deals were driven by leaders who understood that the immediate costs would be outweighed by long-term benefits.Second, timing matters. Many of these purchases were made during times of crisis, when the sellers were in desperate need of money. Russia needed funds after the Crimean War, Napoleon was seeking revenue to fuel his European campaigns and Denmark sold the Virgin Islands as it faced the threat of German expansion. Moreover, the true value of land often is not immediately apparent. What was once seen as a frozen wasteland or swampy territory has turned out to be resource-rich and strategically vital. These deals also had significant geopolitical consequences, reshaping the balance of power across continents and cementing the status of emerging superpowers.In conclusion, the world’s largest real estate deals were not just about land; they were about power, vision, and strategy. From Alaska’s oil reserves to the geopolitical importance of the Virgin Islands, these transactions continue to influence global politics and economics. They stand as testaments to the power of visionary leadership and the lasting impact of seemingly simple decisions about buying and selling land. “Land is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything, for ‘tis the only thing in this world that lasts.” —Margaret Mitchell, Gone with the Wind.—The Statesman (India)/ANN ","summary":"Throughout history, some real estate deals have not just changed borders they have rewritten the course of empires and reshaped global power dynamics.

A trainee doctor was brutally raped and murdered while resting in a seminar room after completing a 36-hour shift at the hospital. Tens of thousands of people in India’s major cities have taken to the streets, demanding justice and prompt investigation. The event has stirred anger in India, especially among women, highlighting the discourse on women’s safety and the challenges faced by female medical professionals. The RG Kar Medical College incident should ring alarm bells all over South Asia as it is a reminder of how women in the region are unsafe regardless of who they are, what they do or where they go. It also reminds us of the precarious situation of women’s safety in Nepal, where rape cases and violations of women’s rights in general are on the up. The Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC) published the Nepal Human Rights Year Book 2023, which documented 4,228 victims of women’s rights violations in Nepal in 2022. The report documents 605 incidents of rape, 145 cases of attempted rape and 42 incidents of sexual abuse. In 2021, there were only 3,417 such victims, up from 2,606 in 2020.Last week, police detained six people in Arjundhara of Jhapa district for gang-raping a 16-year-old girl. Cases of minor girls and women being raped in schools, workplaces, chhaugoths, homes and other places by men make headlines every now and then in Nepal. We have become habituated to seeing them, and only when the severity is extreme or an influential person is involved do we speak out in the media or on the streets. But, then, we gradually forget it all. In some ways, we are becoming desensitised as we still think it is somebody else who is suffering.Further, justice has constantly been elusive for rape victims. The highly publicised Nirmala Pant rape-and-murder remains unresolved, with no arrests till now. During the decade-long insurgency, many women were raped and brutally assaulted. Some were accused of being Maoists and repeatedly raped in captivity. Nearly two decades since the guns fell silent, these victims are yet to get justice. These cases reflect the extent of impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of such crimes.The recurring rape cases point to a broader problem of patriarchal violence and social conditioning. In Nepal, this is reflected in the legal framework that is more protective of the accused than the victim. In 2022, when people protested to remove the statute of limitations on rape, which was previously only one year, the National Assembly ratified new amendments increasing the time limit by a few years. Adults could now file a lawsuit within two years of the incident, and minors could initiate legal proceedings within three years of the victims turning 18. These time limits for seeking justice do not justify crimes as horrendous as rape that are unconstitutional and against the principles of fundamental rights. Moreover, experts argue that blanket laws determining the jail time for rapists oversimplify the crime; it ignores the severity of rape cases by focusing solely on the victims’ age.This state of affairs must change. Yes, we need solid legal frameworks to protect the victims. But we should also invest in the execution part, for instance, in forensic tests and other medical examinations to establish sexual assault. It is time that we as a society overcame our default “himpathy” and delivered justice in a way that is acceptable to the victims.

Even the national charter allows for a Nepali to occupy the President’s chair twice, they aver, and in a country where governments change every nine months or so, the proposal for a two-time prime minister is not feasible either.

As Sharma argues, since the 1990 political changes, the same three or four leaders have ruled the country. In this time, the Congress party too has been under the grip of a handful of leaders, he reasons. Sharma was talking about the Congress, but he could have been referring to any of Nepal’s other major political parties. While the CPN (Maoist Centre) chair and three-time prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has been at the party’s helm for 35 years, the CPN-UML chair and three-time prime minister KP Sharma Oli also has an unshakable hold on his party.

They accuse fellow party leaders of ‘betrayal’, blame an alliance partner for sabotaging their campaign, or hint at election rigging. It is never their mistake. In this light, Sharma’s proposals may be a little impractical, but they hint at a more ethical and accountable politics.They also prompt some logical queries. Is it really the case that there is no good replacement for the current set of leaders of Nepal’s major political forces? Can these leaders claim with evidence that Nepal has progressed and prospered under their repeated premierships? The case is the opposite, in fact. There would not be such widespread scepticism of Nepali politics and politicians had these leaders governed well, had the service delivery in the country been even half decent and had corruption been under some control.

Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepal’s nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepal’s transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Court’s order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top court’s directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a ‘zero draft’ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victims’ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victims’ consent mandatory. If a victim doesn’t want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top court’s directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the court’s directives. I can’t say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said ‘so and so’ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isn’t this akin to directing the court? Wouldn’t it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. It’s already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the country’s transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldn’t even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepal’s peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the ‘zero draft’ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didn’t the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Don’t you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldn’t we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldn’t be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Don’t you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this.
