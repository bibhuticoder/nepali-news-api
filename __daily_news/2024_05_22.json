In the complaint, the applicant accused Sirohiya of using multiple citizenships and demanded that the offence be investigated according to the Citizenship Act 2006.Soon after the allegation against him surfaced, Sirohiya had promised to cooperate in the judicial investigation. But the police proceeded to detain him without inquiry based solely on the complaint.Following the issuance of the arrest warrant, Sirohiya expressed his shock at the arbitrary nature of the warrant. “If I am to be arrested based on a single complaint, without even giving me a chance to explain myself, I too would like to lodge a complaint against Home Minister Lamichhane. Can the state arrest him too?” he questioned.He said there was now not a shred of doubt that the home minister was having him arrested—including by getting someone close to him to lodge a case against Sirohiya in Dhanusha district—just because Kantipur Publications has doggedly pursued the cases of his involvement in scams related to various cooperatives. Both on Monday and on Tuesday, the day of Sirohiya’s arrest, Kantipur daily, the Post’s sister publication, had published fresh evidence of illegal transfer of cooperative funds by Lamichhane into the accounts of a private television company. The Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) issued a statement condemning the arrest, also accusing the deputy prime minister and home minister of trying to exact vengeance against Sirohiya. “The Kantipur Publications has been consistently publishing the news of Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in various scams. Lamichhane has been issuing statements to defame the Publications’ editorial leadership and the entire media sector, and hence the federation is of the opinion that Sirohiya’s arrest is vindictive,” reads the FNJ release.“The federation has taken seriously the arrest of Sirohiya from the Kantipur Publications, even though he had promised to cooperate in the judicial investigation on the allegations against him,” the statement said.Meanwhile, Nepali Congress President and former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba questioned the government on Sirohiya’s arrest. “The vindictive arrest of Sirohiya, the chairman of Kantipur Media Group, is an undemocratic move by the government. The decision of the coalition government aimed at disparaging the media is regrettable,” he wrote on social media. Another former prime minister Baburam Bhattarai also took to X to denounce the arrest. “Whatever the reason, the government's dramatic arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya does not look good,” Bhattarai wrote.“What is ironic is that during the People’s War, when then-king Gyanendra’s government arrested Sirohiya and other fellows of Kantipur for publishing my article on the royal massacre in 2001, we, including our then [Maoist] Supreme Commander Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal] strongly opposed it. Today, I am ashamed to see the Prachanda government following the path of Gyanendra by arresting Sirohiya,” Bhattarai stated.The arrest has been questioned by leaders of the ruling coalition themselves. Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of the ruling CPN-UML, has said that the state lost its composure in arresting Sirohiya. “There are questions on whether there was a need to arrest KMG Chairman Kailashiji,” Gyawali told Kantipur daily. “The state shouldn’t lose its cool while arresting any individual. It appears that the state didn’t exercise patience in this incident.”Gyawali added, “There appears to be a dispute between the Kantipur daily and Home Minister Lamichhane regarding news on embezzlement of cooperative funds. It should be clarified whether this arrest is a repercussion of that.”While addressing the press following his arrest, Sirohiya said that as a responsible citizen, he was ready to provide full support in every investigation in line with the law. “But KMG, of which I am the chairman, will not be disturbed by any retaliation and interference meted out by abusing the state power,” he said.Prior to this, after the district court issued the arrest warrant, Sirohiya issued a statement where he claimed the warrant was aimed at blackmailing Kantipur into refraining from publishing further reports on the cooperative scam. “It is the media’s responsibility to raise their voice and demand justice and fair investigation into all those involved in the embezzlement of the hard-earned savings of more than 7.1 million depositors in various cooperatives,” Sirohiya said in the statement. “There is no doubt that the filing of the complaint and the issuance of the arrest warrant against me without any interrogation has been done to blackmail Kantipur into not publishing more reports on the issue and to divert attention.”Senior Congress leader Shekhar Koirala has also questioned the intent of Home Minister Lamichhane following the KMG chairman’s arrest. “He is the one holding two passports and obstructing the investigation into allegations of cooperative scam,” Koirala wrote on social media, referring to Lamichhane. “But [he] has detained the chairman of KMG, the media which stood as a watchdog of information and democracy for three decades… [This is] unacceptable.”Likewise, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa lashed out at the government, particularly Home Minister Lamichhane. “Though it is said Sirohiya was arrested for going against the law, this ill-intended move is just a pretext to exact vengeance,” Thapa writes. “This move, taken by misusing state authority, is an attempt to cover up one’s crime, divert attention away from it and stop those questioning it.”Earlier on the day, other Nepali Congress lawmakers also objected to the arrest warrant against Sirohiya, saying it was issued at the behest of those in power. The lawmakers said that the warrant came as an attack on the press and termed it an assault on democracy. Visiting the central office of KMG at Thapathali, Kathmandu, they vowed to defend press freedom and democracy.The lawmakers who visited KMG office to express their solidarity included former foreign minister NP Saud, Ramhari Khatiwada, Rajendra Bajgain, Raju Thapa, Bir Bahadur Balayar, Partima Gautam, Chanda Chaudhary, Dipak Giri, Kusham Thapa Magar, Ram Krishna Yadav, Shyam Ghimire and Nagina Yadav.Earlier, while speaking during the special hour in Parliament on Tuesday, Badri Pandey, the Congress deputy general secretary, said the party would oppose Sirohiya’s arrest as a result of political vendetta.“Every citizen should abide by the law, but if the chairman of the KMG is arrested based on political interests, our party will not tolerate it,” Pandey said. “There is much evidence against Home Minister Lamichhane to prove his involvement in embezzling 1 billion rupees from four cooperatives.” The Congress has been obstructing Parliament for two months, demanding a parliamentary inquiry into Lamichhane, but the government has thus far ignored the call.Lamichhane has been deflecting accusations or difficult questions by making counter-accusations or raising unrelated issues, taking a ‘whataboutery’ approach, as experts have put it.A journalist turned politician, Lamichhane has been dismissive of mainstream media ever since he was elected to Parliament in 2022. Earlier, when he had to step down as home minister following questions about his passport and citizenship, Lamichhane had made wild accusations against the media fraternity, with the Kantipur Media Group again being the main target of his criticism. KMG had then extensively reported on his possession of dual citizenship and passport, which led to his resignation following a Supreme Court conviction. Of late, Kantipur Publications has been consistently reporting on Lamichhane’s involvement in the embezzlement of cooperative funds.“This example proves the state does not tolerate the media industry,” Yubaraj Ghimire, the editor of news website Deshsanchar, told the Post. “Any accused can be brought under the law but it does not mean police can detain the accused without inquiry just because of a complaint lodged against them.”The Nepal Media Society, an umbrella association of Nepal’s mainstream media houses, has also criticised Home Minister Lamichhane.In a statement on Tuesday, Shubhashankar Kandel, the society’s president, said the society “strongly condemns the incident of issuing an arrest warrant against Sirohiya by misusing the agency under him [Lamichhane] for personal gains and ego.”The statement further read, “The home minister himself is guilty of misuse of dual citizenship. This reprehensible incident against the head of one of Nepal’s major media houses is condemnable. Therefore, we call on all citizens, various rights organisations and political parties to stand against this kind of undemocratic tendency which is carried out at the behest of someone to forward their interest by abusing state agencies.”Others condemning Sirohiya’s arrest include Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden, Janamat Party Chair CK Raut, ruling CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Ram Karki and a host of prominent people from all walks of life. ","summary":"Nepal Police on Tuesday arrested Kailash Sirohiya, the chairman of the Kantipur Media Group, from his office at the Kantipur Publications’ headquarters in Thapathali, Kathmandu.Sirohiya was detained based on a complaint filed by Sarlahi district's Indrajit Mahato—who is also a working committee member of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane's Rastriya Swatantra Party Madhes province branch—at the Dhanusha district police office on April 28. In the complaint, the applicant accused Sirohiya of using multiple citizenships and demanded that the offence be investigated according to the Citizenship Act 2006.Soon after the allegation against him surfaced, Sirohiya had promised to cooperate in the judicial investigation. But the police proceeded to detain him without inquiry based solely on the complaint.Following the issuance of the arrest warrant, Sirohiya expressed his shock at the arbitrary nature of the warrant. “If I am to be arrested based on a single complaint, without even giving me a chance to explain myself, I too would like to lodge a complaint against Home Minister Lamichhane. Can the state arrest him too?” he questioned.He said there was now not a shred of doubt that the home minister was having him arrested—including by getting someone close to him to lodge a case against Sirohiya in Dhanusha district—just because Kantipur Publications has doggedly pursued the cases of his involvement in scams related to various cooperatives. Both on Monday and on Tuesday, the day of Sirohiya’s arrest, Kantipur daily, the Post’s sister publication, had published fresh evidence of illegal transfer of cooperative funds by Lamichhane into the accounts of a private television company. The Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) issued a statement condemning the arrest, also accusing the deputy prime minister and home minister of trying to exact vengeance against Sirohiya. “The Kantipur Publications has been consistently publishing the news of Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in various scams. Lamichhane has been issuing statements to defame the Publications’ editorial leadership and the entire media sector, and hence the federation is of the opinion that Sirohiya’s arrest is vindictive,” reads the FNJ release.“The federation has taken seriously the arrest of Sirohiya from the Kantipur Publications, even though he had promised to cooperate in the judicial investigation on the allegations against him,” the statement said.Meanwhile, Nepali Congress President and former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba questioned the government on Sirohiya’s arrest. “The vindictive arrest of Sirohiya, the chairman of Kantipur Media Group, is an undemocratic move by the government. The decision of the coalition government aimed at disparaging the media is regrettable,” he wrote on social media. Another former prime minister Baburam Bhattarai also took to X to denounce the arrest. “Whatever the reason, the government's dramatic arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya does not look good,” Bhattarai wrote.“What is ironic is that during the People’s War, when then-king Gyanendra’s government arrested Sirohiya and other fellows of Kantipur for publishing my article on the royal massacre in 2001, we, including our then [Maoist] Supreme Commander Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal] strongly opposed it. Today, I am ashamed to see the Prachanda government following the path of Gyanendra by arresting Sirohiya,” Bhattarai stated.The arrest has been questioned by leaders of the ruling coalition themselves. Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of the ruling CPN-UML, has said that the state lost its composure in arresting Sirohiya. “There are questions on whether there was a need to arrest KMG Chairman Kailashiji,” Gyawali told Kantipur daily. “The state shouldn’t lose its cool while arresting any individual. It appears that the state didn’t exercise patience in this incident.”Gyawali added, “There appears to be a dispute between the Kantipur daily and Home Minister Lamichhane regarding news on embezzlement of cooperative funds. It should be clarified whether this arrest is a repercussion of that.”While addressing the press following his arrest, Sirohiya said that as a responsible citizen, he was ready to provide full support in every investigation in line with the law. “But KMG, of which I am the chairman, will not be disturbed by any retaliation and interference meted out by abusing the state power,” he said.Prior to this, after the district court issued the arrest warrant, Sirohiya issued a statement where he claimed the warrant was aimed at blackmailing Kantipur into refraining from publishing further reports on the cooperative scam. “It is the media’s responsibility to raise their voice and demand justice and fair investigation into all those involved in the embezzlement of the hard-earned savings of more than 7.1 million depositors in various cooperatives,” Sirohiya said in the statement. “There is no doubt that the filing of the complaint and the issuance of the arrest warrant against me without any interrogation has been done to blackmail Kantipur into not publishing more reports on the issue and to divert attention.”Senior Congress leader Shekhar Koirala has also questioned the intent of Home Minister Lamichhane following the KMG chairman’s arrest. “He is the one holding two passports and obstructing the investigation into allegations of cooperative scam,” Koirala wrote on social media, referring to Lamichhane. “But [he] has detained the chairman of KMG, the media which stood as a watchdog of information and democracy for three decades… [This is] unacceptable.”Likewise, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa lashed out at the government, particularly Home Minister Lamichhane. “Though it is said Sirohiya was arrested for going against the law, this ill-intended move is just a pretext to exact vengeance,” Thapa writes. “This move, taken by misusing state authority, is an attempt to cover up one’s crime, divert attention away from it and stop those questioning it.”Earlier on the day, other Nepali Congress lawmakers also objected to the arrest warrant against Sirohiya, saying it was issued at the behest of those in power. The lawmakers said that the warrant came as an attack on the press and termed it an assault on democracy. Visiting the central office of KMG at Thapathali, Kathmandu, they vowed to defend press freedom and democracy.The lawmakers who visited KMG office to express their solidarity included former foreign minister NP Saud, Ramhari Khatiwada, Rajendra Bajgain, Raju Thapa, Bir Bahadur Balayar, Partima Gautam, Chanda Chaudhary, Dipak Giri, Kusham Thapa Magar, Ram Krishna Yadav, Shyam Ghimire and Nagina Yadav.Earlier, while speaking during the special hour in Parliament on Tuesday, Badri Pandey, the Congress deputy general secretary, said the party would oppose Sirohiya’s arrest as a result of political vendetta.“Every citizen should abide by the law, but if the chairman of the KMG is arrested based on political interests, our party will not tolerate it,” Pandey said. “There is much evidence against Home Minister Lamichhane to prove his involvement in embezzling 1 billion rupees from four cooperatives.” The Congress has been obstructing Parliament for two months, demanding a parliamentary inquiry into Lamichhane, but the government has thus far ignored the call.Lamichhane has been deflecting accusations or difficult questions by making counter-accusations or raising unrelated issues, taking a ‘whataboutery’ approach, as experts have put it.A journalist turned politician, Lamichhane has been dismissive of mainstream media ever since he was elected to Parliament in 2022. Earlier, when he had to step down as home minister following questions about his passport and citizenship, Lamichhane had made wild accusations against the media fraternity, with the Kantipur Media Group again being the main target of his criticism. KMG had then extensively reported on his possession of dual citizenship and passport, which led to his resignation following a Supreme Court conviction. Of late, Kantipur Publications has been consistently reporting on Lamichhane’s involvement in the embezzlement of cooperative funds.“This example proves the state does not tolerate the media industry,” Yubaraj Ghimire, the editor of news website Deshsanchar, told the Post. “Any accused can be brought under the law but it does not mean police can detain the accused without inquiry just because of a complaint lodged against them.”The Nepal Media Society, an umbrella association of Nepal’s mainstream media houses, has also criticised Home Minister Lamichhane.In a statement on Tuesday, Shubhashankar Kandel, the society’s president, said the society “strongly condemns the incident of issuing an arrest warrant against Sirohiya by misusing the agency under him [Lamichhane] for personal gains and ego.”The statement further read, “The home minister himself is guilty of misuse of dual citizenship.

His only property was one kattha (338.57 square metres) of ancestral land in Chitwan and three tola (1 tola is 11.66 grams) of gold, both owned by his spouse Sita Dahal. Ancestral inheritance was the source he had mentioned for the land and gold. Just a few days later after making his property details public, he had vented his frustration over allegations that he owns multi-storey buildings and is very rich, and asserted that the reality was quite different as revealed in his property disclosure. “When we brothers received our shares of parental property, I got a bigha and a half [1.02 hectares] of land. I sold it all and donated the cash to the party,” Dahal had claimed in the press meet held on December 17, 2016 in Bharatpur, his home district.Seven years later, on Tuesday, Dahal made public his property details again, showing he owns land several times more than what he had declared in 2016. As per the details, he has two plots of land totalling 15 kattha [0.5 hectares] and a building in Bharatpur, Chitwan registered in the name of his deceased wife. He claims that the land is ancestral.However, the details are contradictory. Dahal, who in 2016 had claimed that he had sold all the parental land, said that the land currently in his possession is an inheritance. “It is clear that either he lied in 2016 or he is lying now. Both the details cannot be true,” retired secretary Khem Raj Remi, who also is a former chair of Transparency International Nepal, told the Post. “He must clarify this to the people.”Regmi said not many people were sceptical of Dahal’s property details in 2016. At that time he claimed that he had sold all his land and donated the money to the party. “If he sold his parental land, what is the source of the land he possesses now?” said Regmi. The land with the house in Bharatpur came to light just a couple of months before the November 2022 elections. Dahal claimed he had built the house in his home district as he wanted to spend more time with the people from his constituency. But he didn’t contest the elections from Chitwan and shifted to Gorkha.Dahal’s aides say they cannot explain the discrepancy in the property details. “I have no idea about it. I need to inquire before giving details,” Ramesh Malla, personal secretary to the prime minister, told the Post.Despite suspecting the accuracy of the property details, activists advocating for transparency have commended the Dahal government for resuming the practice of making property details public. The first elected government after the restoration of democracy in 1990 started the practice of making public the property details of the prime minister and ministers.The tradition started by then prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala’s cabinet continued until 2018. Except for Khil Raj Regmi and his team, all prime ministers and ministers up to the second KP Sharma Oli government made their property details public.However, the Sher Bahadur Deuba government which succeeded Oli broke the tradition. Deuba and his ministers didn’t make their property details public despite being in power for a year and a half. Dahal also waited for a year and half to make his property details. It was under pressure from the ministers of the Rastriya Swatantra Party that Dahal was forced to make the details public. The Corruption Prevention Act, 2002 requires prime ministers and ministers to submit their property details within 60 days of joining the government while all public position holders need to submit the details within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year. In addition to the prime minister and ministers, the rule applies to all elected representatives and government employees.Although the Act doesn’t make it mandatory to unveil the property details, successive prime ministers and ministers made them public as a sign of their commitment to transparency. The details were made public after their submission to the Council of Ministers. ","summary":"Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's recently disclosed property details show a significant increase from his 2016 declaration, raising questions about the accuracy of his previous claims of minimal wealth."},{"hash":"f3db18bc9277b417687236a0513fe9e8135087defd8994e6b5d82e2344f374bf","title":"vegetable-prices-rise-due-to-poor-rains-low-yields-and-indian-export-taxes","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/05/22/vegetable-prices-rise-due-to-poor-rains-low-yields-and-indian-export-taxes","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb25-1716341152.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716336000000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"Vegetable inflation increased by 16.99 percent in mid-April compared to the same period last year which traders attributed mainly due to changes in vegetable export policy by India, new taxes imposed by the Nepal’s government this year, poor rainfall affecting the production, and rise in the prices of agricultural inputs.The country’s inflation moderated to 4.61 percent in mid-April compared to 7.76 percent in the same period a year ago, according to the latest macroeconomics update issued by the Nepal Rastra Bank. However, vegetable prices, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI)-weighted basis, are up 16.99 percent in mid-April, after rising by 14.07 percent in mid-March.“As Nepal is dependent on vegetable products from India like onion, potato, and lemon, as well as other green vegetables to fulfil the demand, certain changes in export policy by the Indian government affect the prices here,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetables Market Development Board.India restricted the export of onion for a few months and also introduced export duty and minimum export price and these drove up onion prices and contributed to inflation in this major kitchen staple, Shrestha said.The price of a kilo of onion nearly doubled to Rs200 in retail in the Nepali market from Rs120 per kilo after India’s export ban in December last year.Vegetable traders said that as the government imposed tax on potatoes, onions and other vegetables, as well as fruits and food items, it also contributed to vegetable inflation this year.Potatoes, onions and other daily consumable farm products are exempt from VAT under the Value Added Tax Act of 1996. But this fiscal year the government amended the law through the Financial Bill 2023, removing 170 goods from the tax-free list.Taxes totalling 23.5 percent are charged on potatoes, onions and other vegetables, fruits and food items—9 percent agriculture service charge, 1.5 percent advance tax and 13 percent VAT.The climate factor plays a major role in the production of vegetables as the agriculture system in the country is dependent on rainfall due to insufficient irrigation system, traders said.The less than average rainfall for a prolonged period impacted winter and rainy season vegetable production, Shrestha said.The price rise in other inputs like fertiliser, seeds, labour and agricultural equipment have also directly affected vegetable prices, Shrestha said. The price of all the agricultural inputs has increased in recent times, he said.Labour shortages in farm areas, especially in rural areas, have hit production as youths are leaving the country as migrant workers, severely impacting production, Shrestha said.The price of essential kitchen staples like tomato, potato and onion has increased within a month.According to the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the wholesale price of local small tomatoes has increased by 62.63 percent within a month to Rs45 per kg on Tuesday, while Indian tomatoes saw an increase of 2.57 percent, and now costs Rs66.67 per kg. Also, the price of tomato small (tarai) has increased by 11.11 percent to Rs50 per kg. The price of tomato big (Nepali) has declined by 30.77 percent to Rs45 per kg.The wholesale price of potato red has increased by 14.54 percent within a month to Rs54.60 per kg while the price of potato (white) increased by 19.23 percent to Rs46.50 per kg. The price of potato red (Indian) has fallen marginally by 1.41 percent to Rs47 per kg.The wholesale price of onion dry (Indian) has increased by 22.65 percent to Rs83 per kg within a month.On May 4, India lifted the ban on onion export after nearly five months but imposed a minimum export tariff of $550 per tonne.The wholesale price of other vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, eggplant, green peas, bottle gourd, squash, green vegetables, chilli, green coriander and garlic have gone up within a month.The wholesale price of cabbage increased by 22.44 percent to Rs40 per kg and cauliflower by 2.57 percent to Rs66.67 per kg within a month. Eggplant became dearer by 40 percent to Rs35 per kg in a month.Green peas became expensive by 100 percent to Rs170 per kg during the review period while bottle gourd price went up by 57.14 percent to Rs55 per kg.Similarly, the price of squash increased by 20 percent to Rs30 per kg in a month. The price of green leafy vegetables like spinach and cress increased by 17.34 percent to Rs146.67 per kg within a month.The wholesale price of broccoli increased by 72.73 percent to Rs95 per kg.The wholesale price of chilli increased by 54.55 percent to Rs85 per kg while garlic dry (Nepali) price increased by 22.58 percent to Rs190 per kg within a month.Although it is the rainy season and peak vegetable season, prices have not dropped due to low rainfall, which has affected production, Shrestha said. Both the production and timely arrival of vegetables have suffered from lack of rain, leading to higher prices, he said.“Kalimati fruits and vegetable market used to receive 700-800 tonnes of vegetables daily during this season in past years, but now we are receiving 600-700 tonnes.

Is the law different for people facing the same accusation in the same country?” he questioned.All those guilty should be punished as per law, even Sirohiya, but he was arrested for vengeance by Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, Kandel added.The media fraternity also expressed their belief that the KMG chair had been taken into custody because the home minister was scared after his name had been mentioned in news reports on cooperative scams published by Kantipur and other media houses. “Kailash Sirohiya’s arrest is wrong. We strongly believe, and are firm about the fact, that he was arrested simply because of the news written and published [by Kantipur],” Reporters Club of Nepal President Rishi Dhamala said.Anyone can be brought under investigation, but there is ill intention behind the arrest of the KMG chair, Dhamala added.“The authorities can investigate his citizenship issue. But the way the entire Nepali media fraternity has been attacked with ill intention and for vengeance is unacceptable. We are ready to do whatever it takes [to safeguard the dignity of the media].”Dhamala also added that Lamichhane had repeatedly attacked the media and that he couldn’t bear criticism.“Home Minister Lamichhane has always targeted and repeatedly attacked the media when he speaks. Criticism and protest are the beauty of democracy. The home minister was scared after his name was stated in the reports of cooperatives scams published by Kantipur and other media houses.”KMG chair Sirohiya was arrested by a team of the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office personnel from the Kantipur Publications’ headquarters in Thapathali, Kathmandu on Tuesday. He has been held in custody in Dhanusha.Sirohiya was detained based on a complaint filed by Indrajit Mahato of Sarlahi district at the Dhanusha district police office on April 28. In the complaint, the applicant accused Sirohiya of using multiple citizenships and demanded that the offence be investigated according to the Citizenship Act 2006.The media fraternity and political leaders have condemned the arrest, calling the move a breach of the constitution and an abuse of state power.

They certainly retain their importance, but the profile of a wardrobe assistant and an appearance consultant has certainly increased manifold. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had an image of changing attires at least four times a day in his first term; on a campaign trail, he bettered his record by doing so in eight hours! Even when abroad, a performance artiste targets the domestic audience. There is a reason the Mayor of Kathmandu, Balendra Shah, decided to don a headgear with a pair of crossed khukuris on the red carpet at Cannes.Professional politicosEven though merely rhetorical, politicians once swore allegiance to some ideology and promised to change society according to their convictions when put on the seat of power through military coups, armed revolutions or democratic elections. Military generals have a smaller audience to convince—fellow officers and/or their foreign sponsors.Revolutionaries need to attract a few fellow desperados with visions of greatness. In electoral politics, aspirants have to perform in salons to muster moneyed patrons and playact in public forums to mobilise the masses. With the premature declaration of the end of history, hardheaded realism is the only creed left standing in the political arena. All politics is performance, and any politician is only as good as his last act.The scriptwriter of DPM Lamichhane’s preparation for entry into politics isn’t publicly known. It seems he was told early on that “politainment”—portmanteau composed of “politics” and “entertainment”—and ethnonationalism were going to be the two wheels of his ride through the fast lane into Singha Durbar. A portmanteau formed of “politics” and “entertainment”—politainment is analogous to infotainment and implies blending politics with entertainment. Lamichhane began his re-entry into Nepal with a television programme pompously titled “Buddha was born in Nepal”, as if it needed his confirmation! His populist Sidha Kura was anything but straight: It pandered to the prejudices of the masses in the name of people. Ethnonationalism is perhaps the most powerful political anaesthesia; it transforms the target audience into zombies unable to see anything other than conspiracies and prevents them from taking responsibility for their inaction in the face of injustice. His programmes were more about soundbites than substance, but he managed to convince the voters of Chitwan to elect him twice.The rush of ethnonational adrenaline generated in the wake of the 16-point conspiracy will slowly recede. Before ennui begins to frustrate the masses, the ruling class—or rather, the community of rulers—needs to invent another excuse to retain control. The 100 Rupee note with an amended map may not be enough to incite patriotic paroxysm, which is probably a good thing. On this Buddha Jayanti, prayers for good sense to prevail in the ruling community to ensure just peace for everyone in the country.

The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had an image of changing attires at least four times a day in his first term; on a campaign trail, he bettered his record by doing so in eight hours! Even when abroad, a performance artiste targets the domestic audience. There is a reason the Mayor of Kathmandu, Balendra Shah, decided to don a headgear with a pair of crossed khukuris on the red carpet at Cannes.Professional politicosEven though merely rhetorical, politicians once swore allegiance to some ideology and promised to change society according to their convictions when put on the seat of power through military coups, armed revolutions or democratic elections. Military generals have a smaller audience to convince—fellow officers and/or their foreign sponsors.Revolutionaries need to attract a few fellow desperados with visions of greatness. In electoral politics, aspirants have to perform in salons to muster moneyed patrons and playact in public forums to mobilise the masses. With the premature declaration of the end of history, hardheaded realism is the only creed left standing in the political arena. All politics is performance, and any politician is only as good as his last act.The scriptwriter of DPM Lamichhane’s preparation for entry into politics isn’t publicly known. It seems he was told early on that “politainment”—portmanteau composed of “politics” and “entertainment”—and ethnonationalism were going to be the two wheels of his ride through the fast lane into Singha Durbar. A portmanteau formed of “politics” and “entertainment”—politainment is analogous to infotainment and implies blending politics with entertainment. Lamichhane began his re-entry into Nepal with a television programme pompously titled “Buddha was born in Nepal”, as if it needed his confirmation! His populist Sidha Kura was anything but straight: It pandered to the prejudices of the masses in the name of people. Ethnonationalism is perhaps the most powerful political anaesthesia; it transforms the target audience into zombies unable to see anything other than conspiracies and prevents them from taking responsibility for their inaction in the face of injustice. His programmes were more about soundbites than substance, but he managed to convince the voters of Chitwan to elect him twice.The rush of ethnonational adrenaline generated in the wake of the 16-point conspiracy will slowly recede. Before ennui begins to frustrate the masses, the ruling class—or rather, the community of rulers—needs to invent another excuse to retain control. The 100 Rupee note with an amended map may not be enough to incite patriotic paroxysm, which is probably a good thing. On this Buddha Jayanti, prayers for good sense to prevail in the ruling community to ensure just peace for everyone in the country.

Raisi, a prominent figure in the political elite, held substantial sway over Iran’s domestic policies. He was also central to Iran’s recent moves to improve relations with its rivals in the region.Given his sizeable influence, what will his absence mean for the country’s domestic affairs? And how will it impact the country’s relations in the region?Maintaining stability at a perilous timeRaisi’s government was very conservative and had a close relationship to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. There were almost no conflicts or disagreements between the two sides, which contrasts with previous governments, most of which had some distance or tension with the leader.Raisi was also considered one of the leading candidates to succeed the 85-year-old Khamenei, who has held the office of Supreme Leader for 35 years. His broad influence within the country’s conservative circles made him a significant figure in shaping the future of Iran’s leadership.However, his death, which occurred a year before the conclusion of his second term, came amid a backdrop of domestic, regional and international challenges.Iran remains under severe sanctions imposed by the United States for its nuclear program, which have caused significant damage to the economy and had a profound impact on people’s lives.The country also witnessed one of the most significant protest movements in its history over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022, following her arrest by the morality police.There have been local protests in different parts of the country as well, mostly over the economic crisis and some of the government’s domestic policies.Moreover, parliamentary elections in March of this year saw one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the country’s history. As a result, the holding of new elections, which is mandated within 50 days of Raisi’s death, poses a significant challenge for the regime at a time when its public legitimacy is at its lowest.In addition, the recent escalation in the ongoing shadow war with Israel has presented serious security concerns and given rise to a host of conspiracy theories. Rumours have gained traction with the public suggesting the president’s helicopter crash was the result of electronic warfare, a drone attack or even a ground assault by Israel. (The IRNA state news agency said the crash was due to a “technical failure”.)Despite these challenges, however, the transfer of power is unlikely to significantly impact the country’s stability due to the nature of power dynamics in Iran. The Iranian political system consists of multiple interconnected circles under the guidance of the Supreme Leader. Losing one main player would not cause a major disruption when there are several others ready to fill the void.Vice President Mohammad Mokhber has stepped in as acting president until new elections are held. It is expected the conservative inner circle close to the Supreme Leader will select its preferred candidate for the poll, aiming for a smooth transition with minimal challenges.However, a historical analysis of leadership in the Islamic Republic suggests a recurring pattern of power shifting between conservatives and reformists, which creates a sense of balance in Iranian politics and boosts the regime’s public legitimacy.Hence, even though Raisi’s successor will be nominated and supported by a conservative inner circle, he may embody somewhat of a moderate stance. Figures like the current parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, or former speaker Ali Larijani, who are both moderate conservatives, fit this description.What will it mean for Iran’s neighbours?During his tenure, Raisi shifted the country’s foreign policy more towards the Middle East, making it the top priority. This marked a departure from his predecessor, Hassan Rouhani, who had prioritised strengthening relationships with European countries and normalising ties with other Western nations.During Raisi’s presidency, for instance, Iraq hosted five rounds of negotiations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, culminating in the historic normalisation of relations between the two in early 2023.As a former advisor of strategic communication to the then-Iraqi prime minister, it became evident to me that Iran was earnest about forging a strategic, long-term, robust relationship with its neighbours.The outcome of these negotiations marked the end of a lengthy civil war in Yemen, facilitated the normalisation of Arab countries’ relations with Syria, and contributed to enhanced stability in Iraq.Additionally, Iran has recently engaged in substantial negotiations with Jordan and Egypt, facilitated again by Iraq. These initiatives offered a chance to move past the sectarian conflicts that have long dominated the region and lay the groundwork for greater cooperation.Iran also grew closer with both China and Russia also during Raisi’s presidency, reflecting a strategic, long-term pivot towards the East endorsed by the Supreme Leader. However, Iran also continued negotiations with Western powers over its nuclear program, employing different tactics compared to Rouhani’s tenure.Iran’s foreign policy looks likely to remain the same under a new president. The appointment of Ali Bagheri Kani as acting foreign minister following the helicopter crash (which also claimed the life of the current foreign minister) reinforces this continuity. Kani, who played a key role in leading the nuclear negotiations under Raisi, aligns with the country’s established foreign policy direction.In addition, Iran’s closer relations with its neighbours signal a more permanent shift away from isolation.

A meeting of top leaders from major political parties—both ruling and opposition ones—agreed to end the House deadlock by forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam with links to Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The leaders formed a taskforce of four second-rung leaders to prepare terms of reference for the probe panel. While defining the jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee, the task force member from Lamichhane’s Rastriya Swatantra Party even became ready to list the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane had allegedly received money. Whether to specifically mention Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction remained the major bone of contention and the members were trying to find a meeting point. In the meantime, the main opposition Nepali Congress became ready to allow Home Minister Lamichhane to address the House. For weeks, Lamichhane had been arguing that it was injustice to bar him from speaking in Parliament, thus depriving him of a chance at clarification. As per the understanding, Lamichhane addressed the House. Unfortunately, Lamichhane presented himself in an utterly irresponsible way, spending most of his time slinging mud at opposition lawmakers, and the Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa in particular—in fact at all those who were asking for a probe against him. He threw caution to the wind and tore parliamentary decorum to shreds. Had he presented himself in a responsible way and had he really wanted to use the opportunity to clear the old deadlock, his Sunday’s speech in the House could have been a turning point. Alas! It was just the opposite. He further provoked the opposition and spoiled the situation that was headed in a positive direction. The crux of his over half-an-hour-long lecture was that “if you all [leaders from opposition parties] have for so many years engaged in various wrongdoings, why should I be punished for following the same corrupt path?” He disappointed many of those who reckoned that the main opposition was doing Lamichhane injustice by depriving him of a chance to speak out on the allegations leveled against him. Instead of explaining his case based on facts, figures and documents, he threatened to reopen old cases in which opposition leaders were allegedly involved. While issuing such threats, he seemed to forget that he is the home minister who can immediately order law enforcement agencies to investigate and take actions against those involved in such crimes, including those publishing ‘baseless’ news against him. In doing so, he not only disappointed his followers but also, perhaps inadvertently, suggested that the country’s home minister is helpless to act while all kinds of grave crimes are happening all around him. Leaders often engage in heated arguments in the House. But someone in Lamichhane’s position—deputy prime minister, home minister and chair of the fourth largest parliamentary party—is expected to exercise a minimum level of restraint. When they speak from the Parliament’s rostrum, they not only address other lawmakers in the hall but also millions of people in and outside the country. Lamichhane went way beyond that red line on Sunday. His no-holds-barred speech is not the kind of precedent the holders of highest offices in the country should be setting.    ","summary":"After weeks of uncertainty, things had started to appear a touch clearer from Saturday evening.

That followed his nomination by the Communist Party last week.As head of the public security ministry, Lam, 66, has been a crucial figure in a sweeping anti-graft campaign, known as “blazing furnace”, which is aimed at rooting out widespread corruption but has also been seen by critics as a tool to sideline opponents during political infighting.That in turn is denting the country’s appeal among foreign investors, who mostly reduced their securities holdings in recent months in coincidence with bad political news. It is also paralysing the public administration, with billions of dollars in foreign aid and public funds unspent.After his election, Lam told lawmakers he would “resolutely and persistently continue the fight against corruption”.The state president holds a largely ceremonial role but is one of the country’s top four political positions, the so-called ‘four pillars’.

Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. ","summary":"Sunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time.

Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said.

A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  ","summary":"Nepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3.

It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepal’s agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.“The situation is alarming,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.“The survey was intended to see people’s perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,” he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. “Most of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,” said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. “If they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.”The survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  ","summary":"Climate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics.

Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  "},{"hash":"23b4b73f6dbaecd3c86cd5207b0f5e82602ed0630a0ee33c58624cab8eb5f28a","title":"flawed-textbooks-idea-of-nepal-with-prakriti-nepal","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/videos/2024/05/15/flawed-textbooks-idea-of-nepal-with-prakriti-nepal","date":1715731200000,"source":"kp","category":"videos","content":"Education in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled.

Among the accused are his stunning secretary and lover and his equally wealthy father-in-law. There is evidence, but not enough to support either party. The verdict is unpredictable, and the outcome is in the hands of the jury, picked from the audience. Intriguing enough?Adapted and “Nepalified,” as director Raj Kamal puts it, from Ayn Rand’s ‘On the Night of January 16th’, ‘Guilty or Not Guilty’ is more than just a play; it is a case study that not only delves into the psyche of its characters but also into those of the audience members who judge them.I’ve always wanted to be on the jury in a court case, thanks to my fascination with Bollywood courtroom dramas. I haven’t yet encountered a real-life court case, but a theatre one was equally enthralling. So, when the audience was asked to raise their hands to be the jury, I couldn’t resist the temptation. Watching the play from the jury’s perspective captivated me, and I noted every clue as different witnesses took the stand.The defendant in the case, Karina Aire (played by Samapika Gautam), is the most interesting character of all. She is attractive, seductive and destructive—a true archetypal femme fatale, as described by the testimonies of various characters in her life. Many dislike her, many fall in love with her; she is ambiguous and riveting. I couldn’t keep my eyes off her—even when she wasn’t on the witness stand. Karina is a double mirror, an actress in every sense of the word. She lies, she cheats, she deceives. Tears and screams, whether genuine or staged, punctuate her performance, blurring the line between victim and perpetrator. But who’s to say? The truth is ambiguous anyway. Various witnesses give their testimonies, including the security guard of the apartment building from which the business tycoon, Radhey Shyam Agrawal, fell to his death. His maid, his accountant, his wife’s private detective, his wife, his wife’s father, and a goon all testify. The range and diversity of characters, along with the actors' portrayals, are truly commendable. Each actor does justice to their role. The play seamlessly transitions between humour, emotional intensity, and sombre moments—engaging the audience in a rollercoaster of emotion.My decisions and guesses regarding the verdict kept reverberating between guilty and not guilty constantly because, as the play unfolds, so do the secrets. Every moment of the play is gripping—you will not be able to take your eyes off the stage. It is a two-hour play, but because of the intensity of the actors' emotions and the labyrinthine plot, you will remain focused, questioning and delightfully confused.The play takes an enthralling turn when Radhe Shyam’s socialite wife, Nistha Pandey (played by Basana Timilsina), enters the stage. In stark contrast to the enigmatic and alluring Karina, Nistha embodies a soft and vulnerable nature. During her testimony, she portrays a woman who truly loved Radhe Shyam. She recounts the time when he proposed to her and when he first met her. Her recollections sound genuine and authentic. However, in a world where everyone wears a facade, trust becomes elusive. I couldn't help but notice how in her testimony, she doesn't seem to love Radhe Shyam but seems to love the idea of him, which could’ve manifested in a controlling behavior and might've led her to contribute to her husband's murder in some way.When conflict between mistress and wife, Karina and Nistha sets off, the whole stage ignites with intensity. Karina accuses Nistha of purchasing her lover for three crores, a scene reminiscent of Sridevi's character in ‘Judaai’. During these moments in the play, one questions: Who is the other woman? The vindictive and passionate Karina, or the submissive and demure Nistha? Or are both of them pawns in Radhe Shyam’s larger game?Radhe Shyam and Karina are portrayed as social climbers, convinced of their superiority and willing to do anything for wealth. They are superficial, opportunistic, and deceitful. The narrative depicts them as reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde, deeply intertwined in their souls and willing to go to any lengths for each other. Throughout the play, it was difficult for me to empathise with Radhe Shyam, as he is portrayed as a lawless psychopathic narcissist.However, shockingly, many audiences found themselves empathising with his character. Raj Kamal, the director, expresses that this might be because, in some ways, Radhe Shyam might represent the hope of the youth. After all, unlike his father-in-law, he started from scratch to build his wealth.If you're seeking a play that strictly adheres to courtroom protocol, you might find this play a bit exasperating, as it tends to somewhat take an unhinged route at times. However, despite these deviations, the play is undeniably intriguing and offers a unique experience not commonly seen in the Nepali theatre scene.In this play, everyone, including the audience, is on the trial. It serves as a compelling case study, pushing audiences to question the reliability of narrators and their memories, as well as the steadfastness of their worldviews. As the voting finally arrived, I couldn’t help but confront my own biases. I reflected on why I voted a certain way and whether it revealed something about myself and my personality. This play compelled me to look inward, and I pondered its themes long after leaving the theatre.This play might just be for you if you're a fan of open-ended interpretations or endings that leave you feeling unsatisfied. But if that's still not your cup of tea, catch this play for its intriguing plot and emotional richness.Guilty or Not GuiltyDirector: Raj Kamal FakirCast: Anand Tamrakar, Avash Adhikrai, Samapika Gautam, Basana TimilsinaDuration: 2 hoursVenue: Kausi Theatre, TekuShowtimes: Every day at 5:30 pm and extra 1:30 pm show on Saturday until June 8.

As per their agreement, a four-member committee led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, who also is a CPN-UML leader, was formed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the parliamentary probe. The committee also includes Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the UML, and Shishir Khanal of the RSP. However, marathon meetings by the Giri-led panel starting Sunday morning could not agree on the ToR as the ruling parties stuck to their guns. The main opposition insisted that the investigation against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the primary focus of the probe panel. The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the RSP chair.“We don’t want the committee just for the sake of forming one. It needs to investigate what we are pressing for,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Nepali Congress chief whip. “The ruling parties want a probe panel with a broader objective, without investigating the home minister.” The ruling party leaders, however, say the Congress wants to form the committee with the objective of implicating a particular person (Lamichhane). “The sole objective of the Congress is to target an individual, which is not acceptable. Their demand has nothing to do with resolving the problems in the cooperative sector but only with implicating the home minister,” said the UML’s Bartaula.RSP leaders say they were even flexible about including (Lamichhane-linked) Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation, but only if the Congress agrees to allow the probe committee to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. “However, the Congress leaders didn’t agree. They backtracked from Saturday's agreement,” said the RSP’s Khanal. As the parties were in negotiations to finalise the ToR, a meeting of the House of Representatives called for 11 in the morning was postponed to 2 pm, which was again postponed to 4 pm. With no agreement in sight, the House meeting finally commenced at 6 in the evening with the single agenda of allowing Lamichhane to clarify the accusations against him.A meeting of the opposition parties held earlier in the morning had agreed to allow the home minister to answer questions raised against him, a chance he had long been asking for. The meeting called by the Congress was attended by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The opposition parties, particularly the Congress, which had been barring Lamichhane from addressing the House and presenting bills, had agreed to allow him to clarify the matter. Addressing the House after more than two months, Lamichhane not only defended himself, but also launched a personal attacks on several Congress leaders. Daring anyone to present concrete evidence of fraud, he said, “I challenge anyone to show evidence that any decision was made to acquire a loan from cooperatives, that I submitted any loan applications or signatures during the loan process, or that any funds were deposited into my account during my tenure at Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd.” He claimed that fake loan statements were prepared in the cooperatives in his name, for which he is not responsible. “I haven’t signed any documents nor have I been on their boards or served in official capacity in any of the cooperatives. Never ever did the Gorkha Media decide to take loans from cooperatives,” he said. “I am not responsible to clear the filth created by [then Gorkha Media chair] GB Rai.” He said he has been hounded based on the sensational media headlines targeting him. Lamichhane also lashed out at the Nepali Congress, revealing that the party had offered him the prime ministerial position for a term of a year and a half. He questioned the party's moral stance, wondering why they considered him unfit for the role of home minister yet found him suitable for prime minister.“If I am ineligible to serve as home minister, with what moral justification do I assume the post of prime minister? I wish to raise this question in the House today. Is the offer for the prime ministerial position still valid, or has it lapsed?” said Lamichhane.He asked if the Congress was ready to constitute a probe panel against everyone the media has linked with corruption. Without naming Gagan Thapa, the Congress general secretary, Lamichhane accused him of selling the country's secret information to foreigners. Citing media reports, he also claimed that Thapa had embezzled millions of rupees in the name of constructing a park at Tri-Chandra College and had misused agricultural grants. He also asked whether the main opposition would want a probe panel against those who have been accused of grabbing the land of Bansbari Leather and Shoe Factory, illegally registering public land in Tikapur under individuals’ name, and stealing luxury watches, or selling diplomatic passports. “Not just those who hold two or three citizenship, the agents and assets of the foreigners who hold one citizenship and one passport but sell the country’s secret information must be ousted as the lawmaker,” he said.In response, the Congress leaders said Lamichhane was rattled by the demands to investigate him. Holding a press meet after the House meeting, Congress leader Thapa said not just Lamichhane but his larger team is also involved in the embezzlement of savings from cooperatives. “It seems they [Lamichhane and other RSP leaders] are trying their luck at running a political party having already operated cooperatives and a media company,” he said. Stating that such committees have been constituted in the past, Thapa said if Ram Sharan Mahat, Bharat Mohan Adhikari or Janardan Sharma can be investigated, why not Lamichhane. He also challenged the home minister to uncover any wrongdoing on his part. “If I am guilty, I need to face legal action. If he is guilty he has to go through the same process,” he said asking Lamichhane why he fears investigations.Thapa challenged the home minister to investigate his entire life, starting from his birth in Prasuti Griha [maternity hospital] in Kathmandu. “Look at the kinds of allegations he [Lamichhane] has levelled against me. I request him: Please form a committee to probe me… Such a committee to probe Gagan Thapa can be formed even within the RSP. Please do it.”Thapa said his party primarily wants an investigation into the embezzlement of money in the cooperatives with Lamichhane’s involvement as they believe that police have been barred from investigating them.“We are clear the House cannot function until a probe committee is formed as per our demand. The vote of trust motion will also not move ahead so long as the committee is not formed,\" said Thapa.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take a vote of trust from the lower house on Monday. However, lack of agreement among the parties has put it into uncertainty. “We will try to agree on the ToR on Monday morning. Even if we can’t come to an agreement, the Congress should allow the vote on the trust motion as it is being done as per a constitutional obligation,” said Bartaula.

Even if we can’t come to an agreement, the Congress should allow the vote on the trust motion as it is being done as per a constitutional obligation,” said Bartaula.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal himself had held meetings with ruling parties and also the main opposition Nepali Congress to find a way out.

The ruling parties, particularly Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), did not agree to the proposal to focus only on the cooperatives where Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane is allegedly involved. “Our demand is to constitute a parliamentary committee to investigate the problems facing the cooperative sector, including Rabi Lamichhane’s involvement in the alleged fraud. The ruling alliance is not ready for it. It wants a panel that will broadly investigate the problems in the sector without addressing our concerns.

Second, as problems have been seen in several cooperatives, there must be a broader investigation,” said Manish Jha, an RSP lawmaker. “Why just focus on three or four cooperatives?

The situation escalated after UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress vice president Dhanraj Gurung engaged in an intense argument. Other lawmakers from the two sides subsequently joined the resulting scuffle.

On April 26, 2021, the Oli-led government allowed the use of the land exempting the ceiling for the deal. However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oli’s Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific land’s detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the court’s final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new location’s production capacity. Technical experts’ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.“It [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,” Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. “The Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,” Oli said. “They once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.”When the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. “Abiding by the court’s ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,” Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives funds’ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhane’s most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. “The parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,” Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oli’s allegations against his party. When the Oli government amended laws related to land-swapping, Thapa of the Congress, who demanded an investigation into the Oli Cabinet’s decision, was a House member. Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.“Though one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,” Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli government’s decision in the court, told the Post. “In such instances, it’s the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.”King Mahendra’s implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step. The law fixed the ceiling of land possession by individuals at 28 bighas in Tarai districts. The land exceeding the ceiling would be nationalised. Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the law’s implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information. In Birtamod, Jhapa, the Giri brothers owned 500 bighas. Before the Land Reforms Act came into effect, the Giri brothers proceeded to register the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in order to safeguard the property. Land reform laws introduced later did not apply to the land as it had already been used for agricultural purposes.

However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oli’s Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific land’s detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the court’s final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new location’s production capacity. Technical experts’ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.“It [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,” Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. “The Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,” Oli said. “They once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.”When the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. “Abiding by the court’s ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,” Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives funds’ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhane’s most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. “The parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,” Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oli’s allegations against his party. When the Oli government amended laws related to land-swapping, Thapa of the Congress, who demanded an investigation into the Oli Cabinet’s decision, was a House member. Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.“Though one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,” Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli government’s decision in the court, told the Post. “In such instances, it’s the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.”King Mahendra’s implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step. The law fixed the ceiling of land possession by individuals at 28 bighas in Tarai districts. The land exceeding the ceiling would be nationalised. Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the law’s implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information. In Birtamod, Jhapa, the Giri brothers owned 500 bighas. Before the Land Reforms Act came into effect, the Giri brothers proceeded to register the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in order to safeguard the property. Land reform laws introduced later did not apply to the land as it had already been used for agricultural purposes.

This is considered an epidemic season, in which hundreds of thousands of people get infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases and snakebites.“Over six to eight snakebite victims seek treatment in our hospital daily,” said Dr Bimal Sharma Chalise of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Number of patients seeking snakebite treatment has gone up after a rise in rainfall activities.”Along with water-borne and vector-borne diseases, snakebites and resulting deaths are common in Nepal during the rainy season.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snake bites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Along with snakebite cases,the number of patients infected with diarrheal ailments, fever and jaundice has also risen in the hospital.“Most of the snakebite victims seeking care at our hospital are either from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from the districts adjoining the Valley,” said Chalise. “Most of the snakebite victims are farmers, women and children who work or play in the fields or go to the jungle to collect fodder for their cattle.”Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. The disease, which has been associated with higher temperatures, is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality.Doctors at the hospital say around half a dozen diarrheal patients are also seeking treatment every day. Similarly, patients having jaundice and fever due to typhoid are also seeking care at the hospital.Typhoid fever, usually called typhoid, is a highly contagious disease caused by Salmonella typhi, which spreads through contaminated food or water. Studies have shown that the disease can be fatal in up to 10 percent of the reported cases.Typhoid fever has been found throughout the world, but the problem is acute in areas without safe drinking water and sanitation. Nepal has also recorded major typhoid outbreaks in the past, but very few cases have been reported in the last few years.Nepal introduced the typhoid vaccine in the routine vaccination programme in 2022.The Ministry of Health and Population launched a month-long nationwide vaccination campaign against typhoid, during which around seven million children between the ages of 15 months and 15 years were inoculated.“Cases of water-borne diseases and snakebite have started to spike of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “We should all be cautious about the food and water we eat and drink. We must ensure that food and water is safe before eating.”Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive against the risks. They say that people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats. They say that people should be asked to keep their houses and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in the bush, avoid walking at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.“Most of the water resources get contaminated during monsoon season, as rainwater gets mixed in the water resources,” Pun said.

However, spring paddy is grown on only 104,712 hectares.Spring paddy is planted in 35 districts between mid-March and mid-April. Plantation of this crop, however, is not common because it requires better irrigation. As a result, most cultivators prefer to grow paddy during summer when there is abundant rain. Despite low acreage, productivity of spring paddy is high, with harvests standing at 4.98 tonnes per hectare, as against 3.97 tonnes for regular summer paddy.In Lumbini province, spring paddy was transplanted on 3,038 hectares last fiscal year, which has shrunk to 2,677 hectares in the current fiscal year. Bardiya, one of the top spring paddy-producing districts in Lumbini province, has seen the area shrink to 1,201 hectares from 1,450 hectares in the last fiscal year.Except for Rolpa and Rukum, spring paddy is cultivated in all districts of Lumbini province. Spring paddy production areas in Palpa have dwindled to 630 hectares this fiscal year from 700 hectares last year.

The demand for fine and long-grain rice varieties, however, has been increasing exponentially. But these varieties are not produced on a commercial scale in Nepal.Palpa, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Pyuthan, Kaligandaki, Badikhola, Ridi Khola, Mathura and other areas were once popular for spring paddy as the terraced fields used to be covered with paddy during the March-May period.

The dairy plant in Imilia in ward 9 of Buddhabhumi Municipality in Kapilvastu district has been producing 1,000 litres of mohi daily since mid-April. The company said the demand for the drink, a good source of protein and calcium, has been growing.In Nepal, it is consumed especially during the summer. The producer said that traditionally the drink used to be a favourite in villages, but gradually lost its appeal to more popular beverages like Coca-Cola and Pepsi.“That is why we have started the production and branding of mohi,” said Thaneshwor Neupane, chairman of Global Dairy. “We are the first Nepali company to start the commercial production of bottled mohi and label it. We have introduced the product in the market with attractive packaging.”The company has expanded sales and distribution to six districts of Lumbini province. “This is our first phase of expansion. We have planned to go across Nepal,” said Neupane.The brand, ‘Buddhabhumi’, is named after the birthplace of Buddha. Shankar Pandey, finance chief of the company, said that the drinks give energy and refresh people. The retail price is Rs50 per litre bottle. The dairy factory said it has spent Rs15 on each bottle and its labelling, bringing the total cost to Rs38-40 per bottle, Pandey said.“We have given special focus to maintaining the standard and purity of mohi.”Mohi is made from curd recommended by the food technologist. First, the substance that turns milk into curd is tested. After that, the acidic and potential hydrogen levels are tested, and mohi is made only from consumable curd.The curd is then mixed with processed water in a machine until it reaches the right consistency for bottling. The finished product is packaged in sets of 12 bottles and is sent to the market based on demand.“Bottling is also nice, and the taste is also good,” said Punaram Aryal, a consumer from Imilia.The company said 28,000 litres of mohi have been sold so far since its production started last week. The mohi produced is consumable within 5-6 days from the date of manufacture.According to locals, mohi has become a great option to other cold beverages produced by multinational companies. “Public response to the product is positive and this has encouraged us,” Neupane said.The factory currently has been producing 3,000 litres of mohi daily, Neupane said.Rajendra Singh Lodh, a food technologist, said special attention has been given to the purity and quality of the product.In Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, it is also said that drinking mohi after meals makes the body healthy and active. Daily consumption of mohi boosts immunity and improves the digestive system, according to food technologists.Mohi is rich in potassium, calcium, and protein. It also gives the body freshness and hydrates it.Drinking mohi is also considered beneficial for people fighting long-term diseases.Global Dairy, which has been operating for a decade, has started producing mohi as a new product, with an investment of Rs500 million. The company, which has been producing 50,000 litres of milk daily, said it is planning to increase the capacity to 100,000 litres.It aims to produce powdered milk too.“If the marketing of mohi goes well, then it will also be a boon for dairy farmers who often face milk holidays,” said dairy farmer Shiva Gulam Kori of Budhhabhmi municipality.The company has 79 collection centres in Lumbini province and two in Sudurpaschim province, and it has 15,000 farmers associated with it.

The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018, were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” warned Gautam. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health Officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country.

The same vector also spreads elephantiasis or filariasis and Japanese encephalitis.Experts say mosquitoes become infected after feeding on infected birds, especially crows. When the infected mosquitoes bite humans and animals, they spread the virus, which can cause neurological problems and death in infected persons. India has reported a death from the West Nile virus in Kerala and six other cases of infections in Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode districts in recent days. Ojha said that Nepal is a member state of the World Health Organisation and receives every alert issued under the International Health Regulations. “Nepal is in the high-risk zone for an outbreak of the West Nile Virus due to its climate, presence of virus spreading vector, and mobility of people to and from the high-risk zones,” said Ojha. At least two cases of West Nile Virus infection were reported in a study carried out in Nepal in 2009-2010. Of 2,046 serum samples tested to examine the virus, two samples contained fragments of the genome resembling virus lineage 1.Experts say there is no specific treatment for West Nile virus. They suggest drinking plenty of water and fluids, resting, and taking medicine for fever in mild cases. “Those experiencing severe headache, high fever, weakness and confusion should see the doctor at the earliest,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “As mosquito breeding season has started, one should also take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.”Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis, as multiple studies have pointed out. The United Nations’s report “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases affected by climate drivers have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also reveals that the warming climate has caused the Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquitos to move to altitudes above 2,000 metres in Nepal. This shift in their distribution has serious implications, as over 100 species of Anopheles transmit malaria, more than 950 species of Aedes spread diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile virus, and over 1,000 species of Culex transmit Japanese encephalitis, filariasis, and West Nile virus.Vector-borne diseases, or VBDs, are spread by carriers like mosquitoes, sandflies, kissing bugs, and ticks. The report says that viruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal's hilly and mountainous areas.Experts say frequent movement of people is also a reason diseases are detected in new areas. When disease vectors bite an infected person, they transmit the disease, and the vectors’ entire generation gets infected.The Ministry of Health has reported over 1,000 cases of dengue infection since January, this year.

This shift in their distribution has serious implications, as over 100 species of Anopheles transmit malaria, more than 950 species of Aedes spread diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile virus, and over 1,000 species of Culex transmit Japanese encephalitis, filariasis, and West Nile virus.Vector-borne diseases, or VBDs, are spread by carriers like mosquitoes, sandflies, kissing bugs, and ticks. The report says that viruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal's hilly and mountainous areas.Experts say frequent movement of people is also a reason diseases are detected in new areas. When disease vectors bite an infected person, they transmit the disease, and the vectors’ entire generation gets infected.The Ministry of Health has reported over 1,000 cases of dengue infection since January, this year.

The number of patients suffering from respiratory illnesses—pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among others—has risen significantly not only in this hospital but those across the country, according to health officials. “Polluted air is the chief culprit for the rapid surge in the number of respiratory illnesses,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor at the Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University. “Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke.”Of late, polluted air has been taking a huge toll on public health, throughout the globe.A new report published on Thursday in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal, states that polluted air and high blood pressure are leading contributors to the global disease burden. The report, “Global Burden and Strength of Evidence for 88 Risk Factors in 204 Countries and 811 Subnational Locations, 1990–2021: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021,” shows that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent).Likewise, smoking accounted for 5.7 percent, low birth weight and short gestation 5.6 percent and diabetes 5.4 percent of the burden.Low birth weight, short gestation and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing (WaSH) were among the leading risk factors for the younger population up to 14 years, while for older age groups, metabolic risks such as high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), high blood sugar and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol had a greater impact.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis. Doctors say particulate matter emitted from construction sites, wildfires, wood burning, agriculture activities, and dusty roads worsens air quality, threatening the health of hundreds of thousands of people across the country.Most forests burn every year during the dry season. Vehicular and industrial emissions and the burning of agricultural residue make the air toxic.A recent report by Save the Children also shows critical linkages between air pollution and multi-faceted hazards for children.The report “Breathless Future: Unveiling the Impacts of Air Pollution on Children and Women in Kathmandu and Saptari” shows the systemic impact of air pollution on various aspects of children's lives. It also explores the effects of air pollution on women and underrepresented groups.“Deteriorating air quality, outdoors and indoors, has exposed children and women to many health hazards—asthma, other lung conditions, coughing, skin disease, nausea, and headache,” reads the report. “Alarmingly, these conditions have led to increased cases of pregnancy loss, child organ underdevelopment, and a general decline in life expectancy.”Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively.The reduction in life expectancy depends on where one lives—7.5 years in Mahottari, 7.4 years in Rautahat and Dhanusha, and 7.2 years in Sarlahi and Bara districts, the AQLI report said. Likewise, the pollution has been shaving 6.7 years off the lives of people residing in Siraha, and 6.2 years in Saptari and Rupandehi districts.Environment experts in Nepal said that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development. Polluted air has for long been taking a huge toll on public health in Nepal but what’s alarming is that the authorities have not taken the issue seriously.“We heard the government’s policies and programmes. There is no mention of the issue of air pollution,” said Bhusan Tuladhar, an environmental expert. “How can we mitigate the effects of air pollution, without addressing the problem?” ","summary":"Over 600 people with respiratory illnesses seek care at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital on Tuesdays and Thursdays when the hospital runs its out-patient service.

Amit, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym to protect his privacy, says he vapes just because he wants to.Unlike Amit, Rita (name changed), who is 21, switched to vaping after smoking tobacco for a while. Rita says that since she hopes to quit smoking altogether, she doesn’t mind the Nepal government’s intention to put a blanket ban on e-cigarettes. But doctors say a ban may lead those who smoke vape to switch to smoking tobacco again.As debates continue around the world about the pros and cons of vaping compared to smoking tobacco, the Nepal government earlier this month announced that it was banning e-cigarettes. The National Health Education, Information, and Communication Center (NHEICC), under the Department of Health Services, says it is seeking help from other ministries to enforce the ban. While some vape users the Post talked to said that the ban would help them quit smoking altogether, there are other aspects of the ban that need a more careful consideration for youths’ health, experts say.Meanwhile, some other users said banning vapes makes little sense as tobacco cigarettes are still freely available in the market for people of all age groups. If the government is so concerned about youths’ health, they question, shouldn’t stricter measures be taken to ensure that minors, for instance, don’t purchase cigarettes?Nepal is not the only country to ban e-cigarettes of late. Most recently, the British prime minister announced a ban on all disposable cigarettes, citing risks to youth health following a significant rise in vaping.There are 33 countries that have altogether banned the sale of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), while according to a WHO report published in early 2024, around 74 countries have no regulations on the sale of e-cigarettes.Most countries in the world have a legal age to purchase traditional cigarettes, according to the WHO, while 88 countries have no minimum age limit to buy e-cigarettes.Moreover, the WHO has repeatedly urged countries around the globe to reduce the spread of e-cigarettes. A call to action was published in December last year, urging governments to strengthen regulations on e-cigarettes.Nepal, meanwhile, has no regulations on e-cigarettes. While they haven’t banned e-cigarettes outright, countries like China have imposed a number of regulations, including licensing to sell the products publicly, ban on flavoured products, and imposition of taxes.In a study on the prevalence of e-cigarette usage among undergraduate students in Kathmandu, 21.2 percent respondents said they never used e-cigarettes, while five percent said they currently used cigarettes. An estimation of global e-cigarette use put the number of its users at 82 million worldwide, 14.2 million of them in South Asia.Most countries cite e-cigarettes as a contributor to youth smoking.Nepalis do not need to produce an ID to purchase either tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Amit, for instance, was still a minor when he started vaping. That these harmful products are freely available to people of all age groups goes against the Tobacco Products (Control and Regulatory) Act, 2068 (2011), which says that it is illegal to sell tobacco products to those below the age of 18.“A stricter control on the sale of tobacco products is essential to curb smoking among youths,” says Dr Bhakta Bahadur KC, chief of Health Promotion and Tobacco Control at NHEICC. KC adds that to prevent minors and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the risks of smoking, from purchasing cigarettes, local governments should introduce provisions on licensing. “This is one way to control smoking in vulnerable groups,” says KC.Moreover, banning e-cigarettes fully may not be possible as they are widely sold through social media and smuggled products might still be available for purchase online. The NHEICC is currently calling on other ministries, including the Ministry of Information and Technology, and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, to help it ban e-cigarettes as they are imported from foreign markets.“Right now, the NHEICC is focused on banning e-cigarettes as a whole due to its adverse effects on the health of young adults, and its role as a gateway to tobacco smoking,” KC says.But Dr Augraj Uprety, Doctor of Medicine at the BPKIHS Department of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine in Dharan, provides a different perspective. With the ban on vapes, youths may find themselves attracted to tobacco smoking, as a significant number of vape users, like Rita, turn to e-cigarettes, supposedly to protect themselves from the harmful impacts of tobacco cigarettes.“Banning e-cigarette is not a cure-all,” Uprety says. “It is also vital to focus on handling the nicotine-dependence syndrome which both tobacco and e-cigarette users experience.”Both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical, but tobacco cigarettes contain higher amounts of toxic chemicals than e-cigarettes. But studies show that e-cigarettes are especially harmful for youths as they affect adolescent brain development due to exposure to nicotine, and the aerosol in e-cigarettes has known effects on lungs.Further, there is little knowledge about the long-term impacts of e-cigarettes as it’s a relatively new technology.“I will never say banning e-cigarettes is a bad thing. It is an important move,” Uprety says. “But we also need to conduct a pilot study to figure out the repercussions of a potential ban.” ","summary":"Nineteen-year-old Amit, who’s currently in his gap year, started vaping two years ago.

The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that 57 districts, including three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—have already reported cases of dengue infection.“On average, around 50 people across the country are becoming infected with the dengue virus every week,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “The number could rise in the coming days, as pre-monsoon rainfall activities have recently increased.”Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease throughout the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Around 1,000 people have already been infected with the deadly disease since the start of 2024, according to officials.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of people infected with the deadly virus do not show any symptoms. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus throughout the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Experts say that this is the right time to prepare and prevent possible outbreaks in the coming days.They say that it will be too late if they wait for a massive outbreak. Authorities concerned should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance and take other measures to cut the risk, according to them. Health Ministry officials said that they have alerted all agencies concerned about the risk of a dengue outbreak.“We have alerted all relevant agencies about the risk of a dengue outbreak in the coming days,’ said Dahal. Authorities and agencies at some local units have started activities to make people aware of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, including launching an awareness drive.”Dengue has become endemic in Nepal, as cases of infection are reported throughout the year. Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities are yet to take it seriously. They believe that this lackadaisical approach is responsible for the spread of the virus. What authorities concerned do most of the time is count the number of infections and deaths, according to them.They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian.

This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid.

The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease.

Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.

They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration.

It’s tough, but look what he’s done. He demands a lot every single day,” City’s Norwegian goal machine Erling Haaland said of playing for Guardiola. “If you don’t live up to what he expects you have a big problem.”The Spaniard has now won the Premier League title six times in his eight seasons at The Etihad Stadium and perhaps the only glimmer of hope is that he might decide to follow Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp and step away.“The reality is I am closer to leaving than staying. We have talked with the club—my feeling is that I want to stay now. I will stay next season and during the season we will talk,” the ex-Barcelona boss said. “But eight or nine years—we’ll see.”Incredibly, in the 152 Premier League matches City have played across the last four seasons, they have recorded 112 victories with just 17 defeats, racking up 372 goals.That is in a league regarded as the toughest in Europe, where the huge broadcasting deals mean all 20 clubs have the spending power to sign some of the world's best talent.“Pep Guardiola has designed a style of football that is being copied not just around this country, but all around Europe,” former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville told Sky Sports.“Most of all he is a winning machine that instils that in everybody who works with him.”City’s Belgian midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who along with 23-year-old Phil Foden now has six Premier League titles to his name with City, explained that the secret was quite simple.“The manager sets the tone but this team we enjoy playing with each other. It is not a team with big egos,” he said.“We play around with each other we run like crazy and we just enjoy it. The enjoyment is lasting so that’s it.”It could yet get better for City, with next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Manchester United still to come, and there will be no slackening off until another trophy is in the bag and a double secured, hot on the heels of last year’s treble. ","summary":"Manchester City’s insatiable appetite for trophies spells bad news for any club hoping to break the stranglehold Pep Guardiola’s side continue to have on English football.Admirably, Arsenal pushed them very close this season but once again the sight of Guardiola’s players cavorting with the Premier League trophy was the abiding image of the final day.City’s 3-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday took them to a place not even the great Liverpool side of the 1980s and Manchester United team of the late 1990s and 2000s inhabited.A fourth successive English league title is unprecedented and the big question is who will stop the City march.They have averaged 89.7 points in their last four title-winning seasons and, while Guardiola’s side again failed to threaten the 100 they amassed in 2017-2018, City proved that when the pressure is really on they are almost impregnable.Arsenal and Liverpool both headed City in the standings in the final months of the campaign, but the champions put together a blistering run of 19 wins and four draws since their last league defeat by Aston Villa on December 6.No one was really surprised because in 53-year-old Guardiola City have a manager obsessed with perfection.“It’s a bit demanding at times. It’s tough, but look what he’s done. He demands a lot every single day,” City’s Norwegian goal machine Erling Haaland said of playing for Guardiola. “If you don’t live up to what he expects you have a big problem.”The Spaniard has now won the Premier League title six times in his eight seasons at The Etihad Stadium and perhaps the only glimmer of hope is that he might decide to follow Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp and step away.“The reality is I am closer to leaving than staying. We have talked with the club—my feeling is that I want to stay now. I will stay next season and during the season we will talk,” the ex-Barcelona boss said. “But eight or nine years—we’ll see.”Incredibly, in the 152 Premier League matches City have played across the last four seasons, they have recorded 112 victories with just 17 defeats, racking up 372 goals.That is in a league regarded as the toughest in Europe, where the huge broadcasting deals mean all 20 clubs have the spending power to sign some of the world's best talent.“Pep Guardiola has designed a style of football that is being copied not just around this country, but all around Europe,” former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville told Sky Sports.“Most of all he is a winning machine that instils that in everybody who works with him.”City’s Belgian midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who along with 23-year-old Phil Foden now has six Premier League titles to his name with City, explained that the secret was quite simple.“The manager sets the tone but this team we enjoy playing with each other. It is not a team with big egos,” he said.“We play around with each other we run like crazy and we just enjoy it. The enjoyment is lasting so that’s it.”It could yet get better for City, with next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Manchester United still to come, and there will be no slackening off until another trophy is in the bag and a double secured, hot on the heels of last year’s treble.

From there, it will return to the capital to lie at Tehran’s Grand Mosalla Mosque before being transferred to his hometown of Mashahd, in eastern Iran, for burial on Thursday.Mourners carried posters bearing images of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, the Friday prayer leader of Tabriz city and other officials who were also killed in the crash.DEEPENING CRISISThe death of the president came at a time of deepening crisis between the clerical leadership and society at large over issues from tightening social and political controls to economic hardship.To restore damaged legitimacy following a historic low turnout of around 41% in March’s parliamentary election, Iran’s rulers must stir up public enthusiasm to secure high participation in the early presidential election that will be held on June 28.But Iranians still have painful memories of the handling of nationwide unrest sparked by the death in custody of a young Iranian-Kurdish woman in 2022, which was quelled by a violent state crackdown involving mass detentions and even executions.Widespread public anger at worsening living standards and pervasive graft may also keep many Iranians at home.Some analysts say that millions have lost hope that Iran’s ruling clerics can resolve an economic crisis fomented by a combination of U.S. sanctions, mismanagement and corruption.Raisi enacted the hardline policies of his mentor, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, aimed at entrenching clerical power, cracking down on opponents, and adopting a tough line on foreign policy issues such as the nuclear talks with Washington to revive Iran’s 2015 nuclear pact.Any candidate entering the race must first be vetted by the Guardian Council, a hardline watchdog that has often disqualified even prominent conservative and moderate officials, meaning the broad direction of policy is unlikely to change.While widely seen as a leading candidate to take over from the 85-year-old supreme leader when he dies, two sources said Raisi’s name had been taken off a list of potential successors some six months ago because of his sagging popularity.Raisi’s death has introduced “great uncertainty” in the succession, analysts said, stirring rivalries in the hardliners’ camp over who will succeed Khamenei as the country’s ultimate authority.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) ","summary":"Nepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while.

According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession. ","summary":"The current key financial indicators in Nepal are highly paradoxical and worrisome. According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession.

Despite being a minimal contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Nepal has been ranked one of the most vulnerable countries facing climate change repercussions. The Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative Index, which measures a country’s current vulnerability to climate disruptions and assesses its readiness to improve resilience, ranked Nepal in the 125th position among 192 countries in 2021. Research revealed that the fragile and rugged topographic situation and ineffective response mechanisms and strategies for dealing with natural hazards aggravated Nepal’s vulnerability. The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology also reports that the temperature in Nepal has increased by 0.056 degrees Celsius annually on average, with the highest rate occurring at higher altitudes in the Himalayan regions. Similarly, the precipitation pattern is unusual, especially in the higher mountains. Soil erosion, landslides, flash floods and droughts have all been reported nationwide, wreaking havoc on lives and livelihoods across the country. Studies show that over 80 percent of property losses stem from disasters, predominantly triggered by climate-related hazards. Water-related incidents like floods, landslides and glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) displace communities and demolish residences, agricultural land and essential infrastructure. According to the Nepal Vulnerability and Risk Assessment 2021, climate-induced disasters take a toll on over 647 lives and cost the country an annual economic loss of over Rs2,778 million. National commitments The Government of Nepal has ratified several international commitments to cope with these challenges. The National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) was introduced in 2010. Realising the importance of local intervention, the Local Adaptation Plans of Action (LAPAs) were developed across several local units to aid local governments and communities in building resilience to the impacts of climate change. The LAPAs were developed in regions and communities vulnerable to flooding, droughts or extreme weather events. Following the federal structure, the National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) 2019, the Environment Protection Act (EPA) 2019 and the Environment Protection Regulation (EPR) 2020 were formulated, repealing the Climate Change Policy 2011, EPA 1997 and EPR 1998, respectively. The National Climate Change Policy has been considered a milestone document in realising climate action in Nepal. Besides, climate action has been implemented at the provincial and local levels. Likewise, a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) has been prepared in response to the NCCP in alignment with the Nationally Determined Contributions.Role of local governmentThe Local Government Operations Act 2017 has authorised local governments to work on disaster management, agriculture and food security, small hydropower and renewable energy, watershed management and wildlife and biodiversity conservation. These sectors are pillars of climate adaptation and mitigation. Hence, local governments play a crucial role in minimising vulnerability and building community resilience, contributing to attaining climate targets. Despite the policy interventions and achievements, local readiness remains to be improved. We cannot deny that climate-induced impacts exist at the local level, and thus, intervention is also required. However, in our case, the federal structure has sidelined local climate change issues in development planning. The major problem lies with the institutional arrangement. The Ministry of Forests and Environment is the focal ministry for climate change, but several gaps remain at the provincial and local levels. Though different committees and sections have been assigned to carry out climate action, the question arises regarding the placement of competent and qualified human resources at the local level. The formality of establishing climate units without resources and know-how doesn’t do much. Owing to this situation, translating national policies into local-level planning has failed, and thus, mainstreaming climate change issues into the overall development process has become a daunting task. Unsustainable financial mobilisation, limited research and development, insufficient data assortment and a lack of coordination mechanisms among different levels of government, institutions and stakeholders are a few examples. The gap in integrating the bottom-up approach has failed to resolve climate issues at the local level. The NAP is considered a significant intervention to introduce climate action at the local level, but the financing mechanism dilemma has cast doubt on implementing the proposed climate adaptation actions. The estimated cost of Nepal’s NAP to implement priority programmes until 2050 is $47.4 billion. On the contrary, Nepal’s contribution capacity is only $1.5 billion until the timeframe. This clearly shows our reliance on external funding and support to implement the programmes under the NAP. The dependency creates uncertainty and reduces our adaptive capacity to execute priority adaptation actions at the local level. The consequences of climate change vary geographically. While our higher mountain region faces irregular precipitation and GLOFs, the mid-hill region is severely affected by the consequences of landslides and soil erosion, and people residing in the low-land areas are victims of floods. The intensity, severity and duration of the impacts in each local unit are different, and concurrently, the resilience of each community at the local level also varies. Hence, a single blanket approach does not work when it comes to localising climate actions. A tailored and multi-faceted approach that empowers communities, enhances institutional capabilities, fosters collaboration and mobilises resources at the grassroots level is required. This can be done by building awareness and communicating the understanding of climate change impacts and adaptation/mitigation measures among local stakeholders, including community leaders, government officials, civil society and the public. The local communities can also be empowered to take collective action, leverage local resources and integrate traditional knowledge and practices into climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. There is a need to strengthen the institutional capacity of local units for effective climate governance and implementing climate action plans. Recruiting qualified and competent human resources and enhancing their technical expertise and skills within the local level government is paramount to localising climate actions in Nepal. Moreover, fostering partnerships and collaboration between government and national agencies, academia, private sector and non-government organisations is crucial for leveraging expertise and resources and exchanging best practices in climate change adaptation and mitigation. By strengthening the institutional foundations for climate action, local units can enhance their effectiveness, accountability and resilience in responding to climate change challenges and promoting sustainable development outcomes for local communities.The first step towards localising climate action is ensuring the inclusion and engagement of local government and non-state stakeholders at the local level during the preparation and amendment of climate change policies. Maintaining policy coherence at the national and subnational levels is also crucial. During the implementation of climate change policies, strategic partnerships among national and subnational governments through co-development of the implementation and investment plan, capacity building and access to fiscal transfers and funds are essential.  ","summary":"The impacts of climate change go beyond spatial and temporal boundaries.

A few drizzles helped douse the wildfires that had engulfed large swaths in several districts but not nearly enough to build up soil moisture for summer crops. However, the drought made headlines for a different reason—especially when the wildfires worsened the already polluted air, making Kathmandu the most polluted city globally.Extreme weather events, including droughts, largely driven by global phenomena, have been wearying our opportunities and attempts to prosper. Key sectors like agriculture and hydropower, which Nepal banks on for economic growth, are severely impacted. Yet, the issue is not getting the attention it deserves at home. Extensive drought While our climate concerns remained focused on rising temperatures and the loss of snow deposits, Nepal’s National Climate Change Survey Report, published last Monday, unsurprisingly revealed that widespread droughts are the foremost climate stressors affecting Nepal, hitting its agriculture the hardest. A staggering 65 percent of households and their farms have been continually affected by droughts for the last 25 years. No wonder our farming is shrinking like never before. The report cited the dramatic increase in diseases and insects affecting crops as well. About 50 percent of the households surveyed reported the emergence of new diseases in crops, and an even greater percentage reported the presence of new insects/pests affecting food production.Consequently, fewer people are interested in farming; those who want to continue are being discouraged by these increased threats with no support whatsoever from the state. Alarmingly, the state fails to realise that if it doesn't extend meaningful and sustained support to tackle droughts, mainly in the hills, more people will be forced to quit farming—the direct repercussions of which will be a failure to meet the poverty and hunger goals of Agenda 2030. A drought-induced water shortage will also affect other goals such as health, gender, clean water and sanitation.The survey’s shocking figures regarding water sources, especially for the hilly regions, are extremely worrying, to say the least. Nearly all households in the hills and the mountains in Karnali Province experienced a decrease in water in the streams. Likewise, over two-thirds of households in Sudurpaschim and Karnali hills reported streams completely drying up. About 80 percent of respondents in the Koshi hills reported springs and kuwas drying up. The figure is around 75 percent for Karnali and Sudurpaschim hills. Half of all households in Sudurpaschim-Tarai and around 30 percent in Madhesh-Terai reported hand pumps completely parched. The survey found that almost half of all households have started using higher amounts of chemical fertilisers and improved seeds as adaptation measures. Water conservation, which would have helped address droughts, is practised by a mere 12 percent of the households, with only 2 percent relying on ponds to store rainwater—the sustainable and effective way to combat droughts. Drying local water sources do not simply affect a few people who depend on them to meet domestic and agricultural water needs; they are a visible sign of the changes that have been taking place over decades—something the water managers failed to notice. In fact, anecdotes tell us that people have been displaced by one or another water-induced disaster since the early 1960s. The only difference is that the number of people leaving their villages then was small, and most could find better opportunities in urban centres within the country. Now, thousands of youths wanting to leave their villages due to the same disasters that pushed others to migrate over half a century ago are searching for better opportunities that are no longer available in the country. The other extreme Despite droughts, the overall amount of annual rainfall hasn’t changed much, which points to the very interesting but disturbing rise of the other extreme—high-intensity rain causing damaging floods. The report indicates a changing flood scenario, especially in the hills and the mountains. Nearly 65 percent of the mountain households experienced floods capable of harming physical infrastructure in the last five years, while around half of all households experienced landslides of the same calibre. The hilly region is no exception—nearly 50 percent of the households in the hills were affected by damaging floods and almost 41 percent by landslides. We are starting to see the consequences too. In 2021, the floods in Melamchi, which drastically changed the river morphology, crippled the Melamchi Water Project, built over two decades to bring water to Kathmandu with a price tag of over Rs35 billion. Two years later, heavy rains and floods damaged the physical structures of 31 hydropower projects in eastern Nepal, with an estimated loss of over Rs8 billion. This is a firm reminder that as the drought conditions intensify, so do the risks of severe floods, which will have repercussions on the government’s plan to produce 30,000 MW by 2035 to meet both domestic and export needs. The nature of rainfall-induced floods in the mountain rivers, where large projects—especially hydropower plants—are built, are poorly understood and have become extremely unpredictable due to the shift in rainfall distribution. Short-duration high-intensity hill rains leave little time for advance warning or safety preparations.Troubling times aheadThe promising economic sectors have all been affected by a degradation of the foundation they depend upon—the state of the natural environment, which is undergoing changes at the core, largely connected by changing seasonal hydrology. Though the authorities and communities can collectively breathe a great sigh of relief as light rain in early May doused the wildfires and reduced the chances of their spread this year, we need to be reminded that the year 2023 was the hottest year on record; there’s no reason why 2024 and beyond won’t continue to break the record, especially with no letup in emissions. The resulting winter droughts in the years ahead are likely to be longer and more intense, along with the increased frequency of devastating floods. Droughts will continue to impact food production. Forest fires will continue to cover large areas as the factors that trigger them continue to build up and spread. However, we can and need to encourage as many households as possible to save monsoon rainwater in dugout ponds to help revive the lost or declining water sources. We cannot remain complacent and oblivious to how deep-rooted the problem has gotten.  ","summary":"Weather forecasts over the past several months have been failing—last winter was dry, and the expected rain in April/May, which would mark the beginning of the farming calendar, has been largely nominal.

Eight-and-a-half years after the new constitution institutionalised a three-tier federal state, the provinces, the second tier, neither have police forces of their own nor can they employ their own civil servants. Whenever there is a change of government in Kathmandu, or even a change in coalition partners for that matter, the provincial governments too are invariably rocked. Oh, and when folks in other provinces face some problem, they have to troop all the way to Kathmandu for redress. Sugarcane farmers have repeatedly made the long march from various districts in the Tarai-Madhesh in order to demand a decent price for their produce. The same is the case with the 22-member Chure and Forest Conservation Campaign team that is currently marching from Bhardaha of Saptari district to Kathmandu. Their goal is to garner the national government’s attention on the destruction of the Chure region, a string of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west. Natural water sources originating at the foothills of Chure have been drying up in the past few years, and the first layer of underground water has been severely depleted in much of the Tarai. The campaigners started the long march on April 28 in to exert pressure on authorities concerned about the unchecked deforestation and haphazard extraction of sand and stones in the Chure region, resulting in an acute water crisis. The campaigners have a 12-point charter of demands, including strong action against forest officers who work hand in glove with smugglers, control of illegal extraction of river-bed materials from the rivers and streams in the Chure region, declaration of Madhesh as a dry zone, and concrete plans to control forest fires. Last year, the campaign had undertaken a similar march to Kathmandu demanding control of the pollution of the Sirsiya river that flows through Birgunj, a major business hub in Madhesh Province. The Sirsiya river has become highly polluted due to the toxic industrial waste generated by several factories on the Parsa-Bara industrial corridor. The campaigners had met many high-ranking government officers and ministers in Kathmandu. But nothing happened. The country’s most eco-sensitive region is being devastated by illegal deforestation and sand-mining and millions of people are having to scrounge for water. Yet the authorities, both at the federal and provincial levels, seem unbothered. One big reason the old unitary state was replaced by a federal setup was so that the fruits of development could trickle down to the lowest rungs of the society, and the voices of people at the grassroots could be heard and addressed without delay. Yet what we see is that the same criminal-political nexus that benefitted the most from the old structure continues to dominate the federal state as well. In many cases, the illegal miners and deforestors active in the Chure region would have funded the election campaigns of (current) federal and provincial lawmakers, getting in return the licence to do pretty much as they please. People at the grassroots meanwhile have to beg with the authorities just to drink some clean water. Apparently, the more things change in Nepal, which has long been under the sway of a corrupt elite, the more they stay the same.  ","summary":"Federalism in Nepal is alive and kicking. Eight-and-a-half years after the new constitution institutionalised a three-tier federal state, the provinces, the second tier, neither have police forces of their own nor can they employ their own civil servants. Whenever there is a change of government in Kathmandu, or even a change in coalition partners for that matter, the provincial governments too are invariably rocked. Oh, and when folks in other provinces face some problem, they have to troop all the way to Kathmandu for redress. Sugarcane farmers have repeatedly made the long march from various districts in the Tarai-Madhesh in order to demand a decent price for their produce. The same is the case with the 22-member Chure and Forest Conservation Campaign team that is currently marching from Bhardaha of Saptari district to Kathmandu. Their goal is to garner the national government’s attention on the destruction of the Chure region, a string of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west. Natural water sources originating at the foothills of Chure have been drying up in the past few years, and the first layer of underground water has been severely depleted in much of the Tarai.

But once the monsoon enters in less than a month, we will be back to running for shelter. This year, Nepal, like much of South Asia, could experience above-normal monsoon rains, the result of La Niña, a condition associated with normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over much of South Asia. Technical experts at the 28 sessions of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum (SASCOF-28) held in the last week of April said the second half of the southwest monsoon season will likely develop La Niña. This will also mark the realisation of the fear of two extremes—of heat and rain—in South Asia this year.While we stand to make some windfall from the wet climate, especially in the agricultural sector, there is a huge cost attached to the onslaught of heavy monsoon rains—landslides and flooding. Each monsoon, we fear the worst disasters but make little preparation to deal with them. And if we do not prepare in advance, the bounty we expect from the monsoon will soon turn into bane. Last monsoon, Nepal witnessed 328 events of landslide, 166 events of heavy rain and 59 events of flooding, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). Ninety-six persons were killed in landslides, 19 in floods and eight in heavy rains. This means that our existing mechanisms of defence against destruction will probably not work. We might face similar or even bigger catastrophes this year, too, if we do not prepare well.But as of now, news reports about advanced preparation for disasters are hardly positive. If the unitary state of the past was inefficient in dealing with disasters, the federal state of Nepal has its own complications. While authorities at the NDRRMA complain of a lack of human and financial resources to deal with large-scale disasters, the local levels, which are the closest and the most accessible forms of the state to the people, have similar woes. The familiar problem of a lack of coordination between the three tiers of government stands to dampen our disaster preparedness and response actions.Another set of disasters that comes as part of the monsoon each year is water-related epidemics. Each monsoon enters with the risk of dengue, malaria, and cholera. And it is in these crucial times that our health care system does not function optimally, with health centres in several parts of the country failing to provide basic medicines and care. We cannot make lethargy a habit and wait for disasters. From daivi prakop (divine disasters) to prakritik prakop (natural disasters), we have made some advances in our understanding of disasters. It is now time to consider disasters manaviya prakop—the result of human actions—and intervene on time for risk reduction and long-term resilience.

At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction.

For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction.

At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal.

Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal ","summary":"We understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019.

The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal "},{"hash":"4d564e4aa9b147540d5d27c861b9724bce96976aa16a590835a10f4f29687ad6","title":"contributions-to-nepali","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/letters/2020/11/30/contributions-to-nepali","date":1606694400000,"source":"kp","category":"letters","content":"I am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25).

Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure.

Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave.
