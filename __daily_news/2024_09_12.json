In a patriarchal society like ours, women and girls suffer most from social ills.\nLike many other social ills, the child, early and forced marriages are still in practice in Nepal, and particularly prevalent in the Madhesh and Karnali Provinces, which have evidently robbed the girls of their fulfilling life- education and potential.\nIn this connection, a project enforced in six municipalities of two districts- Mahottari and Rautahat of the Madhesh Province has come to a conclusion that evidence-based and broader social cooperation and collaboration could be a strategic approach to help reduce the social ill- the child, early and the forced marriage.\nThe 'Local Systems Strengthening to Reduce Child, Early and Forced Marriage (R-CEFM)' project was implemented jointly for four years by USAID's Breakthrough ACTION and the Ministry of Sports and Social Welfare in Madhesh Province.\nThe finding of the intervention showed the conventional approach of reducing child, early, and forced marriage could not yield the expected result, but a multi-stakeholder engagement ranging from adolescents to social influencers, political leaders, and religious gurus. Despite the claim that child marriage was declining in the province, it was found still prevalent, thereby taking a toll on the education of adolescent girls in the Madhesh.\nR-CEFM Project Chief Shreejana KC shared the finding amidst a programme in Kathmandu on Wednesday.

A census relating to children's rights showed child marriage was at 53 percent in our local level, while early marriage of girls was over 80 percent.\n\"As a daughter's marriage is a matter of pride and prestige in society, the parents want to marry their daughters before marriageable age. It is difficult to persuade all sides, including parents and girls at once, but gradual intervention helps. So, if we want to change society, investment on adolescent girls along with collaborative measures is must,\" Karki underlined, suggesting expansion of such programmes in all eight districts of Madhes Province.\nSimilarly, Secretary at Ministry of Sports and Social Welfare in Madhes Province, Chudamani Phuyal, appreciated the USAID for the enforcement of the project that helped raise awareness and involved multi-stakeholders to reduce child, early and forced marriage in the respective local levels.\nAs social problems can not be wiped out in a short time, continuous awareness, engagement and capacity building are required. I request the supporters to expand such project in other districts of the province.

They argue that Rana violated the Constitution by writing to the US embassy on behalf of individuals unrelated to her official duties.\n\nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rana's original party, admits her wrongdoing but believes the issue is being overblown. They claim the ruling parties want someone from the Nepali Congress as Deputy Speaker to gain control in the Constitutional Council, which selects important officials.\n\nSome Congress members, led by Shekhar Koirala, are hesitant about removing Rana without a clear explanation and concern over the haste of the process. However, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML (the other ruling party) have gathered enough signatures to move forward with the motion.\n\nIf Rana is removed, the post of Deputy Speaker is likely to go to someone from the Nepali Congress, supporting the claims of the RSP and others.

Excessive rainfall, floods, landslides, and inundation will likely cause widespread damage. For the general public, it is a message to keep themselves and others safe from the extreme weather consequences and not to travel in risky zones.An orange alert has been issued in Bara and Parsa of Madhesh Province; Chitwan of Bagmati; Nawalparasi East, Syangja and Tanahun of Gandaki; Arghakhanchi, Rupandehi, Palpa, Kapilvastu, Nawalparasi West, Dang and Banke districts of Lumbini; Dailekh, Kalikot and Salyan of Karnali; and Darchula, Bajhang and Bajura of Sudurpaschim Province.An orange warning also means moderate risks. Experts say severe situations due to extreme weather events are very likely in the districts. For the general public, it is a message to prepare plans for potential emergencies. As the probability of extreme weather events is high, people are also requested not to travel in risky zones—landslide-prone areas and riverbanks, among others. According to Pradhananga, it is also a request to people to protect themselves and family members.The department has cautioned the public about risks of land erosion, debris flow and inundation in urban areas and in the Tarai.The department warns that water level will increase in big as well as small rivers and streams.“Everyday life, agriculture, health, tourism, road and air transport could also be affected,” the bulletin stated.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day prior to the normal onset day.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts for 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.The Met office has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events, such as flooding, inundation and landslides.The department’s climate section has issued a weather forecast for four months, from June to September. It said most parts of the country are likely to experience above-average minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall due to weakened El Niño conditions and the development of La Niña conditions.El Niño refers to climatic patterns in which ocean surface temperatures warm unusually. La Niña is the opposite, in which the ocean surface cools off.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.

We walked to the terrace, basked under the sun, and chatted for an hour about his life and writing. During the talk, the eighty-one-year-old spoke passionately about literature and fondly looked back on his life. He sort of inspired me with the way he looked at things. “Take your work seriously, but don't take yourself seriously,” he said.After that, we stayed in touch through texts. One day, he told me he was coming to Kathmandu for the Kalinga Literary Festival. So I went to Hotel Himalaya in Lalitpur to chat about books and to receive a signed copy of his memoir, ‘Another Sort of Freedom’, as he had promised me. After navigating the crowd and shooing them away, I finally pulled Das into a corner and bombarded him with many questions. Known for his analysis of Indian society, economy, and history, Das is an Indian author, commentator, and former CEO of Procter & Gamble India. A graduate of Harvard University, he has also written plays and essays, blending his corporate experience with philosophy. Anish Ghimire of the Post sat down with Das to discuss his business life, how he stumbled into writing and books about the many puruṣārthas.What is writing to you? Well, it’s my whole life now. Sometimes, I dream I am completing a sentence, but it’s not coming out right, so I keep editing it. Then I wake up, and as early as six o’clock in the morning, I sit down to write for hours. When it’s going well, I forget myself. Hours go by like minutes. Is that what pulls you towards writing? The act of being in a bubble? A zone where you remain undisturbed? Yeah, that’s it. The thing is, if you love what you do, half the battle is over, and it can be anything, from a business executive to an actor. When people ask me about finding contentment, I always tell them two things: love your work and the person you live with. In my memoir, I talk about a chap named Kamble who worked as a night security guard for our company. He loved his job so much that he kept getting promoted. As for me, I stumbled into being a writer. I didn't want to become an academician and found the business world less satisfying. While working as a business executive, I wore a business hat Monday through Friday and a writing hat on the weekends. It's been thirty years, and I haven't taken off the writing hat. At what point in your business life did you realise that writing was an escape from everything? Well, I wouldn't call it an escape. I studied philosophy and Sanskrit at Harvard, and when I began working, I was thrown into the Indian Bazaars selling Vicks Vaporub. At one point, I got tired of it, and I missed the intellectual life. My mother talked about making a living, but my father talked about making a life. So, I was making a living Monday to Friday and on weekends, I was making a life. But Kamble made his life seven days a week. You studied philosophy and Sanskrit at Harvard University. How did you go from there to being a business executive? That was an accident. After Harvard, I got a scholarship from Oxford to continue my studies. That is when I asked myself, did I want to spend the rest of my life in that stratosphere of abstract thought? I wanted a life of action. Now, what is a life of action? Two hundred years ago, a life of action would mean becoming a warrior or a farmer. But today, we live in a commercial age, and the life of action is business. I also couldn't face the embarrassment on my mum’s face when I sat at home as an unemployed philosophy major. So, I turned the newspaper pages and applied for a job at a company. The company later became Procter and Gamble. I worked with them for decades, and when I approached fifty, I realised there is more to life. So, I retired early and have been a writer for thirty years.You held a high position in a big company for a long time. You were obviously good at your job. But were you happy? I liked the rough and tumble of business life, but it gave me limited pleasure. So, it made sense to combine two hats (business and writing). When office work wasn't going well, I would plunge into my writing, and if I had writer’s block, I would dive into my work again. So it worked for me. But at some point, I decided to be a full-time writer. My part-time writing was doing well, giving me the confidence to pursue it full-time.Tell me about your favourite book.My favourite book is ‘Mahabharata’ because it is very ‘human’. The book has good people doing bad things and bad people doing good things. I prefer it over ‘Ramayana’ because the latter is perfect. The hero is perfect, the hero’s brother is perfect, the hero’s wife is perfect, and even the villain is perfect. Whereas ‘Mahabharata’ is shaded. I like it because of its depiction of actuality and complex human traits. Maybe that explains why my book ‘The Difficulty of Being Good’, about similar subjects, has sold the most copies out of my other books. In your recent writings, have you noticed a shift in the themes or ideas that engage your readers? Each of my books is different as I discuss the different types of puruṣārthas. There are four types; Dharma (righteousness, moral values), Artha (prosperity, economic values), Kama (pleasure, love, psychological values) and Moksha (liberation, spiritual values, self-actualisation).I have written about Artha, ‘India Unbound’, Dharma, ‘The Difficulty of Being Good’ and Kama, ‘The Riddle of Desire’. My latest book ‘Another Sort of Freedom’ is on Moksha. In this writing evolution, I have also learned to write lightly. Reading my memoir, you will see how I structure my sentences. I don't use ‘and’. I call that a killer. I try to connect sentences using commas. Using a few words to say more is what I call writing lightly. Your work often touches on the moral and philosophical aspects of Indian epics. Do you see these ancient texts as relevant in addressing modern-day ethical dilemmas?‘Difficulty of Being Good’ has sold over a quarter million copies because I brought the ‘Mahabharata’ into the 21st century and did not return to the fifth century. I have discussed how the moral dilemmas in the ‘Mahabharata’ affect our lives today. We can learn from the problems faced by Yudhisthira, Draupadi, and others. That was my writing, and it seems people agree with me.Gurcharan Das’s book recommendationsMadame BovaryAuthor: Gustave FlaubertPublisher: Revue de Paris Year: 1857Flaubert’s tale of a woman trapped by societal expectations and desires is a masterpiece of realism. The book explores the consequences of living beyond one's means.Anna KareninaAuthor: Leo TolstoyPublisher: The Russian MessengerYear: 1878The book shows love, infidelity, and the complexities of human emotions.

After days- or weeks-long agitation, successive governments have signed agreements with the representatives of the victims. For instance, last year, the then minister for Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation, Ranjita Shrestha, promised to resolve their problems and signed a seven-point agreement in the first week of August. The government failed to implement it. Then Balaram Adhikari replaced Shrestha at the ministry. The victims had to take to the streets again as the government failed to honour its commitment. Then, an Adhikari-led committee signed an eight-point agreement in March this year. This too was shelved.The authorities failed to make any progress even on the announcement made in the annual budget unveiled in May. The then finance minister Barsha Man Pun, while presenting the budget on May 28, had announced that the money of small depositors of up to Rs 500,000 would be returned. There was no progress on this front as well. Cheated by authorities multiple times, the cooperative victims yet again resumed their protest. This time, after a 108-day long protest, the authorities yet again signed an eight-point agreement with the victims on Monday. And yet again, things are not looking good for the victims. On Tuesday, a day after the ministry officials reached a new deal in Kathmandu and the victims became ready to halt their protests, the area outside the venue in Pokhara where a provincial meeting of the Rastriya Swatantra Party was to take place, turned tense. This happened after a group of cooperative victims showed black flags to party chief Rabi Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling millions of rupees from Pokhara-based Surya Darshan and other cooperatives. Former home minister Lamichhane vented his ire against the victims. He even went on to accuse the victims of being ‘mobilised’ at the behest of certain external elements. This was something unbecoming of the leader of the fourth largest force in the House—and of an ex-deputy prime minister at that. Lamichhane is one of the most high-profile individuals accused in the cooperative scam. A special parliamentary inquiry committee is investigating his involvement. The panel last month quizzed him continuously for around 10 hours. Though Lamichhane and his party have been claiming his innocence, several probes including those carried out by the House committee, police, local governments and other agencies point to his prominent role in the embezzlement of cooperative funds.Multiple studies and investigations have shown that the gravity of the cooperative crisis is unimaginable. The chair of the parliamentary special inquiry committee Surya Thapa says if the issue is not handled properly and promptly, the country’s entire financial sector could face a crisis. As of now, the House panel has found problems in around 500 cooperatives.We thus urge ‘high profile individuals’ linked to the scam not to incite the victims, who have already been cheated by cooperatives and subsequently by government authorities—multiple times. They seem to be running out of patience. The agitation by hundreds of thousands of angry victims of cooperatives may take a nasty turn at any time. At his volatile time, using disrespectful language against them would be like rubbing salt into their wounds. In the same spirit, we urge the parliamentary committee to quickly conclude the study and hand over the final report to the government. Prolonging this sordid saga is in no one’s interest, especially the victims who have clamoured for justice for so long. Given the gravity of the matter, resolving the cooperative crisis—and soon—should be the top priority of the government, the Parliament and all the other involved state agencies.  ","summary":"Thousands of the victims of fraudulent cooperatives’ owners have repeatedly staged massive protests in the capital Kathmandu and other major towns across the country.

This was something unbecoming of the leader of the fourth largest force in the House—and of an ex-deputy prime minister at that. Lamichhane is one of the most high-profile individuals accused in the cooperative scam. A special parliamentary inquiry committee is investigating his involvement. The panel last month quizzed him continuously for around 10 hours. Though Lamichhane and his party have been claiming his innocence, several probes including those carried out by the House committee, police, local governments and other agencies point to his prominent role in the embezzlement of cooperative funds.Multiple studies and investigations have shown that the gravity of the cooperative crisis is unimaginable. The chair of the parliamentary special inquiry committee Surya Thapa says if the issue is not handled properly and promptly, the country’s entire financial sector could face a crisis. As of now, the House panel has found problems in around 500 cooperatives.We thus urge ‘high profile individuals’ linked to the scam not to incite the victims, who have already been cheated by cooperatives and subsequently by government authorities—multiple times. They seem to be running out of patience. The agitation by hundreds of thousands of angry victims of cooperatives may take a nasty turn at any time. At his volatile time, using disrespectful language against them would be like rubbing salt into their wounds. In the same spirit, we urge the parliamentary committee to quickly conclude the study and hand over the final report to the government. Prolonging this sordid saga is in no one’s interest, especially the victims who have clamoured for justice for so long. Given the gravity of the matter, resolving the cooperative crisis—and soon—should be the top priority of the government, the Parliament and all the other involved state agencies.  "},{"hash":"c408a75405675c8d2aa87ac87ffe222e2187c5fe6b6c4fc4869c48b65450ae7c","title":"maritime-security-in-the-indian-ocean","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/09/12/maritime-security-in-the-indian-ocean","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Untitled-1726105920.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1726099200000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"The Colombo Security Conclave (CSC), one of the important minilaterals addressing security concerns in the Indian Ocean region, held a National Security Advisers’ meeting in Sri Lanka on August 30 and signed the Charter and the memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the establishment of the organisation’s secretariat. Previously, India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives had established an annual trilateral defence dialogue. Seychelles and Mauritius were invited to attend the forum as observers. This trilateral defence dialogue was converted into the Colombo Security Conclave in November 2020, with Mauritius as a new member to establish close cooperation between the member countries having similar concerns. National Security Advisers of the four-member countries—Sri Lanka, India, the Maldives and Mauritius—attended the recent meeting, while Seychelles participated as an observer (it may join the group in the future). Bangladesh, which became the fifth member of the CSC in July 2024, did not participate. Apart from the CSC, other regional organisations focusing on the Indian Ocean are the Indian Ocean Rim Association and the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium. Minilaterals always help countries forge deeper ties. India has robust ties with these countries, making it easier to collaborate and cooperate on security matters and enhance capacity building among the members of this maritime grouping. Since 2021, the CSC has also held regular meetings at the Deputy National Security Adviser level. Five pillars of the CSCThe Colombo Security Conclave is based on five pillars of cooperation: Maritime Safety and Security; Countering Terrorism and Radicalisation; Combating Trafficking and Transnational Organised Crime; Cyber Security and Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Technology; and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief. Member countries also participate in the Coastal Security Conference held under the aegis of the CSC. Tabletop exercises (TTX), which are regularly conducted, promote interoperability among the participating countries’ armed forces.The CSC is a regional maritime security architecture based on common security challenges the member countries face. It builds maritime security capacities to respond to emergencies arising from natural calamities and deal with terrorism, piracy and other issues. The cooperation between some of these Indian Ocean littorals can be gauged because the Indian Ocean bears two-thirds of the world’s oil shipments, one-third of its bulk cargo and half of its container traffic. Over three-fourths of its traffic goes to other regions of the world, making it strategically important and a trade lifeline. The security conclave is the newest addition to the existing Indian Ocean Region multilateral forums and aims at close cooperation between the Indian Ocean countries on non-traditional security.Among these countries, India has historically close relations with its maritime neighbours in the Indian Ocean. For example, Mauritius appoints an Indian as its security adviser. Both Mauritius and Seychelles have an Indian Navy Officer as maritime security adviser. These appointments are highly significant for India as both are important partners in the Western Indian Ocean, where China also has a strong presence. The Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles and Sri Lanka are part of the Indian coastal radar network. Bangladesh was offered the installation of a coastal surveillance system in 2019. As all these countries are island nations, it will help them to monitor sub 20-meter fishing boats such as county boats, dinghies and fishing vessels in a heavy sea clutter environment in all weather conditions, thereby enhancing maritime security. Sri Lanka had witnessed how the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam used the sea to ferry arms into the country without being detected by Sri Lankan armed forces. India has established joint Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) surveillance with the Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles and has joint naval exercises with all the CSC countries. It has also provided some of these countries with an Indian-built patrol vessel to enhance their capacity to patrol their maritime coastline and EEZ.Emerging maritime architectureGiven the presence of several major powers in the Indian Ocean, building a regional security architecture on core issues of the Ocean littorals is important. India’s Security and Growth for All in the Region policy, announced in 2015, aims to strengthen ties with the Indian Ocean littorals as the region becomes a hotbed of great power competition. It ostensibly increases the presence of foreign navies to protect sea lines of communication and engage in anti-piracy operations. China’s naval expansion into the Ocean is to protect its trade and anti-piracy activities of its navy. This underlines why the trilateral defence dialogue was expanded, and the Colombo Security Conclave was formed to forge a common platform with countries where India already has robust defence cooperation, except for Bangladesh.Agreement on the five pillars identified by the CSC shows the countries’ priorities. Piracy and robbery have emerged as major threats. Recently, pirates attacked the Bangladeshi ship MV Abdullah, and its crews were taken hostage. The Indian naval warship and a long-range maritime patrol aircraft were pressed into locating the vessel. In February 2023, India and Seychelles inked an MoU to enhance maritime domain awareness, information sharing, anti-piracy operations, counter-terrorism exercises, training and capacity building. Similar bilateral cooperation mechanisms also exist between India and other member states. Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief have acquired significance after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004. At the time, the Indian navy was the first to commence a rescue operation.The CSC countries, including Seychelles, were invited to this year's Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in ceremony. In the past, India has responded militarily to coup attempts in both Seychelles and the Maldives in the past. It maintains close security collaboration with Mauritius, especially on Agalega Island, which would aid India’s maritime reconnaissance. India’s bilateral relations with the Maldives are gradually improving after initial months of setbacks of Indian trainers, which the newly elected President Mohamed Muizzu, riding an anti-Indian campaign, wanted to send back. Given the emerging geopolitical context, the Colombo Security Conclave remains an important forum for the emerging maritime security architecture in the Indian Ocean.

From ancient philosophical discussions to modern social dynamics, it has been celebrated for developing trust and solidarity while also marked by periods of tension, betrayal and change. This balance of loyalty and self-interest makes friendship a relationship filled with both enduring strength and inherent fragility as it circumnavigates the highs and lows of personal and political life alike.In Nepali politics, friendship takes on a particularly complex and often cynical dimension. Political alliances are frequently formed and broken based on convenience and utility, with little or no regard for loyalty or genuine camaraderie. Much like Aristotle’s “friendship of utility”, these relationships dissolve when the mutual benefit ends. Interestingly, when party leaders come together, their followers and cadres also unite to form friendships and align themselves with the shifting dynamics at the top. However, when leaders grow distant or tensions arise, the same divide ripples down to the cadres and followers. This shows friendship’s strategic and transactional nature, where the bonds between party members and leaders are held together by temporary interests rather than a shared vision and commitment required for a long-term collaboration. The unification of the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) in 2018 to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) following the victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections is a telling example. This alliance was initially celebrated as a move towards political stability, but the partnership quickly weakened due to internal power struggles between KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Their friendship, born out of necessity and utility and undermined by deep-seated mistrust and conflicting interests between the leaders rather than genuine camaraderie, quickly disintegrated and collapsed in 2021. This episode validates Jacques Derrida’s scepticism about friendship’s purity and selfless bonds, as even ostensibly strong political bonds are fraught with power imbalances and inevitable betrayal.Similarly, the 2022 alliance between the traditionally adversarial Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-Maoist Centre further highlights this trend. Formed to counter the CPN-UML (and its coalitions) in the parliamentary elections, the alliance dissolved once the parties’ immediate political objectives were met. Such fragile alliances show how political convenience often precedes ideological consistency or long-term collaboration. As Aristotle discusses under “friendships of utility”, these fleeting friendships are not based on trust or understanding but opportunism. This practice of wheelchairing—constantly rotating allies—defines Nepali politics. The recent coalition government led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, formed in July 2024—the third change within two years since the parliament election held in 2022—is yet another example of how quickly political friendships shift based on immediate needs and the desire for power-sharing arrangements. This surprising partnership between the CPN-UML and the NC, once bitter rivals, has confounded many observers. Notably, from the day of this coalition, there have been rumours that it could be discontinued at any moment. People are as suspicious of this political friendship as Derrida was about the concept of friendship itself. It shows that what might appear as friendship on the surface is, in fact, an opportunistic manoeuvre—a reminder of Aristotle’s “friendship of utility”.The shifting alliances among Madheshi political parties further exemplify the fluidity of political friendship. These parties, representing the interests of the Madheshi people in the Terai region, have frequently realigned with larger national parties like the NC, UML, or CPN-Maoist, depending on the political climate. However, these alliances are often short-lived and based on immediate political gain rather than long-term commitments to shared goals or principles. The 2020 merger of the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal (RJPN) and the Federal Socialist Forum Nepal (FSFN) to form the Janata Samajwadi Party quickly led to internal disagreements and factionalism.The recent political history of Nepal shows no trace of Aristotle’s “friendship of virtue”, the highest and most enduring form built on mutual respect and admiration among Nepali political alliances. Nor will one find anything resembling Michel de Montaigne’s (a French Renaissance writer) notion of friendship, which transcends ordinary bonds and achieves a unity that defies explanation, as there is no room for the enduring trust and emotional connection he cherishes. The lack of more profound, virtuous friendships in Nepali politics reflects an unsettling reality: Political bonds are tenuous, driven by short-term gains and susceptible to collapse when the tides of power shift. There is only strategy, manoeuvring and the endless cycle of coalition and collapse. Derridean dictum “O my friends, there is no friend” summarises this sentiment because it underlines the gap between genuine camaraderie and the pragmatic, often self-serving nature of political bonds. At the same time, it urges us to reconsider what friendship means, not just in the political arena but in all spheres of life, where trust and loyalty are too often overshadowed by ambition and short-term goals.Baral is an assistant professor at Tribhuvan University and is currently pursuing PhD from the University of Texas at El Paso, United States.

Such forms of online harassment aren’t seen only during festivals but are an everyday experience for many Nepali women. The internet has become an appendage of the physical reality where violence against women manifests in varied forms, including physical threats, sex trolling, zoom bombing, cyber flashing, revenge porn, etc. Moreover, it has become easier for the perpetrators to target many women at the same time using different online personas. This is evident in the data of the Cyber Bureau of Nepal, where 882 cyber crime cases against women were recorded in just the first two months of the fiscal year 2024-25. The past trends paint a worrying picture, as the bureau reported a total of 5,574 online harassment cases between 2016 and 2020. There were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women in the fiscal year 2022-23. The following year saw an approximate of 90.52 percent increase in cybercrime cases filed by women, for a total of 8,745 cases. With the advancement of digital technologies and the rise of AI content, women are being subjected to more forms of online abuse.

Section 47 of the Electronic Transaction Act, 2007 states that publishing material that harms public morality or decent behaviour could result in a fine of Rs 100,000 and up to five years of imprisonment. It doesn’t define what falls under these terms. Moreover, the Act doesn’t mention revenge porn or other forms of cyber abuse.

When misogynists see women taking up space and challenging traditional gender roles online, they police and shun them on the same platform.

He quickly established himself as a cunning politician whose hands-on style produced results even as he angered critics for concentrating power.He slayed hyperinflation that had thrown millions of Peruvians out of work, privatized dozens of state-run companies and slashed trade tariffs, setting the foundations for Peru to become, for a while, one of Latin America’s most stable economies.Under his watch, the feared leader of the Maoist Shining Path, Abimael Guzman, was captured - dealing a crucial blow to a movement that in the 1980s seemed close to toppling the Peruvian state. Guzman died in prison in September 2021.But many Peruvians saw Fujimori as an autocrat after he used military tanks to shut down Congress in 1992, redrafting the constitution to his liking to push free-market reforms and tough anti-terrorism laws.A slew of corruption scandals during his 10-year administration also turned public opinion against him.Shortly after he won a third election in 2000 - amending the constitution to run - videos emerged of his top adviser and spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos doling out cash to bribe politicians. Fujimori fled to exile in Japan.He resigned via fax from Tokyo and then unsuccessfully campaigned for a Japanese senatorial seat.Montesinos was later captured in Venezuela and jailed, convicted by the hundreds of videos he recorded of himself handing out cash bribes to politicians and business and media executives.The cases against Fujimori piled up - including accusations that he had ordered the use of death squads in his battle against Shining Path militants.Fujimori was safe in Japan - he was a dual citizen and Japan does not extradite its citizens. So many were shocked when in 2005 he decided to head back to Peru, apparently in hopes of forgiveness and a return to politics.Instead, he was detained during a layover in Chile, extradited to Peru in 2007, and in 2009 he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.‘Fuji-shock’Once jailed, Fujimori’s public appearances were limited to hospital visits where he often appeared disheveled and unwell.While detractors dismissed his health complaints as a ploy to get out of prison, then-president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski briefly pardoned Fujimori in 2017.Months later Kuczynski was impeached and the pardon overturned by Peru’s top constitutional court, sending Fujimori back to the special prison that held him and no other inmates.The court restored the pardon in December 2023, releasing the ailing Fujimori, who had suffered from stomach ulcers, hypertension and tongue cancer. In May 2024, Fujimori announced he had been diagnosed with a malignant tumor.Fujimori’s legacy has been most passionately defended by his daughter Keiko, who has been close to clinching the presidency herself three times on a platform that has included pardoning her father and defending his constitution.Outside Fujimori’s residence on Wednesday evening supporters gathered to mourn and pray.\"Today, I weep for a leader,\" Fujimori backer Cesar Valverde said. \"He should have been president again; we were working for Alberto Fujimori to be president again, but God has taken him.\"Keiko had said in July that her father planned to run for the presidency again in the 2026 election.The late Fujimori was born in Lima on Peruvian Independence Day, July 28, 1938.A mathematician and agricultural engineer, Fujimori was a political nobody when he decided to run for the presidency, driving a tractor to his campaign rallies.

Some were former Russian soldiers, at least one of whom had retired after a full-length army career.Grisly footage of dead fighters has now circulated online, and some of relatives told Reuters the bodies of their husbands and sons had been abandoned in the desert. Reuters could not confirm how many of the men it identified were dead.Margarita Goncharova said her son, Vadim Evsiukov, 31, was first recruited in prisonwhere he was serving a drug-related sentence in 2022. He rose through the ranks in Ukraine to lead a platoon of 500 men, she said. After coming home, he worked as a tailor but struggled with survivor’s guilt and secretly travelled to Africa in April to join his former commander, she said.“He wanted to fly to Africa many times. I discouraged him as much as I could,” Goncharova said in an interview with Reuters. “I told him 'fate has given you a once-in-a-million chance. You can start your life again, you've won such a crazy lottery'.”The Russian Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Wagner did not respond to requests for comment for this story.After Prigozhin died in August last year, Wagner employees were invited to join a newly created group called the Africa Corps, under the defence ministry, “to fight for justice and the interests of Russia,” according to the Africa Corps channel on social-media platform Telegram.On the channel, Africa Corps says about half its personnel are former Wagner employees who it allows to use Wagner insignia. Wagner’s social media channels remain active.The Russian government has not publicly commented on the Tinzaouaten battle.Mali's armed forces-led government said the defeat had no impact on its goals. The Malian Armed Forces “are committed to restoring the authority of the state throughout the country,” army spokesman Colonel Major Souleymane Dembele told Reuters.Wagner has acknowledged heavy losses in the Mali ambush but gave no figure. The Malian army, which fought alongside the Russians, also did not give a toll. Tuareg rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland, said they had killed 84 Russians and 47 Malians.Reuters could not independently establish how many were killed in battle. One video, out of more than 20 sent to Reuters by a Tuareg rebel spokesman, showed at least 47 bodies, mostly white men, in military-style uniforms lying in the desert. Reuters verified the location and date of the video.Mikhail Zvinchuk, a prominent blogger close to the Russian defence ministry, said on social media platform RuTube in August that the defeat showed Wagner fighters who arrived from Ukraine had underestimated the rebels and the Al Qaeda fighters.MISSING IN ACTIONWagner-linked Telegram accounts named two of the dead as Nikita Fedyakin, the administrator of The Grey Zone, a popular Wagner-focused Telegram channel with over half a million subscribers, and Sergei Shevchenko, who the accounts described as the unit commander. Reuters could not verify the identity of Shevchenko.Reuters separately identified 23 Wagner operators missing in Mali via relatives who posted in an official Wagner Telegram chat group, checking the names against social media accounts, publicly available data and facial recognition software. All the relatives received calls from Wagner recruiters on Aug. 6 to notify them their men were missing in action, they said in the chat group.Lyubov Bazhenova told Reuters she had no idea her son Vladimir Akimov, 25, who had briefly served in Russia's elite airborne forces as a conscript, had signed up. She was angry with Wagner for sharing no further information about his fate or the whereabouts of his body. She said letters to the prosecutor's office, defence ministry and foreign ministry had gone unanswered.Facial-recognition software was used to identify another two men captured by Tuareg fighters, based on photographs and videos of the ambush site published by Tuareg sources. The Tuareg rebels posted videos and photos of the two captives on social media. Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, a spokesman for the rebel alliance, confirmed the men were in rebel captivity as of late August.One of the missing fighters, Alexei Kuzekmaev, 47, had no military experience, his wife Lyudmila Kuzekmaeva told Reuters.\"Neither my hysterics, nor tears, nor persuasion - nothing helped. He just confronted me a month before he left home. He said 'I bought a ticket and will be leaving.'\"Among the most experienced men was Alexander Lazarev, 48, a Russian army veteran who served in wars against Chechen separatists in the 1990s and 2000s, according to his wife's posts in the Wagner channel.She declined to comment. Lazarev appears in many photos on the Russian Facebook equivalent VKontakte wearing military uniform, with symbols linked to several army subdivisions.PARASTATAL MERCENARY FORCEDemocratic governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger were overthrown in a series of coups since 2020 driven by anger with corrupt leaders and a near decade of failed Western efforts to fight insurgencies that have killed thousands and displaced millions.The military juntas have kicked out French and U.S. troops and U.N. peacekeepers.In Africa, Wagner emerged in Sudan in 2017 as the deniable face of Russian operations. Its enterprises soon ranged from protecting African coup leaders to gold mining and fighting jihadists. Wagner is also active in Central African Republic. It first appeared in Mali in late 2021.Wagner's fortunes rose and fell last year. In May, the group led Russia to its first significant Ukrainian battlefield victory in almost a year with the capture of Bakhmut. But after his criticism of Russian military leaders and his effort to lead a rebellion weeks after the Bakhmut victory, Prigozhin died in a fiery plane crash in August. The Kremlin has rejected as an \"absolute lie\" U.S. officials' claim that Putin had Prigozhin killed.Eric Whitaker, the top U.S. envoy to Burkina Faso until retiring in June, who previously served in Niger, Mali and Chad, said the Putin administration has achieved complete control over the Wagner brand in the post-Prigozhin era.\"Africa Corps earns (the Russian government) hard-currency payments from host governments for its services and also gains a significant sources of revenue from gold derived from its activities in the Sahel,\" he said.Russian mercenary activity soared in Mali after Africa Corps was formed, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a U.S.-based crisis-monitoring group. Based on media reports and social media documenting, the data shows violent events linked to Russian mercenaries rose 81% and reported civilian fatalities rose 65% over the past year, compared to the year before Prigozhin's death.Wagner does not publish recruitment figures. Jędrzej Czerep, an analyst at Warsaw-based think tank Polish Institute of International Affairs, estimated that around 6,000 Russian mercenaries serve in Africa, while three diplomatic sources said about 1,500-2,000 were in Mali.\"When Africa Corps started to promote and recruit, they were flooded with applications,\" said Czerep.\"Being sent to one of the African missions was seen as far safer than Ukraine,\" he said.Tuareg spokesman Ramadane said the rebel alliance was preparing for more clashes.Further losses could eventually drive Russia out, said Tibor Nagy, the top U.S. envoy to Africa in 2019, when Wagner withdrew from northern Mozambique months after around a dozen of its men were killed during a conflict with an Islamic State affiliate.\"They were out of there very quickly,\" said Nagy.Wagner has not publicly commented on its plans in Mali. ","summary":"Among the dozens of Wagner mercenaries presumed dead after a lethal battle with Tuareg rebels during a desert sandstorm in Mali in July were Russian war veterans who survived tours in Ukraine, Libya, and Syria, according to interviews with relatives and a review of social media data.The loss of such experienced fighters exposes dangers faced by Russian mercenary forces working for military juntas, which are struggling to contain separatists and powerful offshoots of Islamic State and Al Qaeda across the arid Sahel region in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.The Mali defeat raises doubts over whether Moscow, which has admitted funding Wagner and has absorbed many of its fighters into a defence ministry force, will do better than Western and UN troops recently expelled by the juntas, six officials and experts who work in the region said.By cross-referencing public information with online posts from relatives and fighters, speaking to seven relatives and using facial recognition software to analyse battlefield footage verified by Reuters, the news agency was able to identify 23 fighters missing in action and two others taken into Tuareg captivity after the ambush near Tinzaouaten, a town on the Algerian border.Several of the men had survived the siege of Bakhmut in Ukraine, which Wagner's late founder Yevgeny Prigozhin called a “meat grinder.” Others had served in Libya, Syria and elsewhere. Some were former Russian soldiers, at least one of whom had retired after a full-length army career.Grisly footage of dead fighters has now circulated online, and some of relatives told Reuters the bodies of their husbands and sons had been abandoned in the desert. Reuters could not confirm how many of the men it identified were dead.Margarita Goncharova said her son, Vadim Evsiukov, 31, was first recruited in prisonwhere he was serving a drug-related sentence in 2022. He rose through the ranks in Ukraine to lead a platoon of 500 men, she said. After coming home, he worked as a tailor but struggled with survivor’s guilt and secretly travelled to Africa in April to join his former commander, she said.“He wanted to fly to Africa many times. I discouraged him as much as I could,” Goncharova said in an interview with Reuters. “I told him 'fate has given you a once-in-a-million chance. You can start your life again, you've won such a crazy lottery'.”The Russian Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Wagner did not respond to requests for comment for this story.After Prigozhin died in August last year, Wagner employees were invited to join a newly created group called the Africa Corps, under the defence ministry, “to fight for justice and the interests of Russia,” according to the Africa Corps channel on social-media platform Telegram.On the channel, Africa Corps says about half its personnel are former Wagner employees who it allows to use Wagner insignia. Wagner’s social media channels remain active.The Russian government has not publicly commented on the Tinzaouaten battle.Mali's armed forces-led government said the defeat had no impact on its goals. The Malian Armed Forces “are committed to restoring the authority of the state throughout the country,” army spokesman Colonel Major Souleymane Dembele told Reuters.Wagner has acknowledged heavy losses in the Mali ambush but gave no figure. The Malian army, which fought alongside the Russians, also did not give a toll. Tuareg rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland, said they had killed 84 Russians and 47 Malians.Reuters could not independently establish how many were killed in battle. One video, out of more than 20 sent to Reuters by a Tuareg rebel spokesman, showed at least 47 bodies, mostly white men, in military-style uniforms lying in the desert. Reuters verified the location and date of the video.Mikhail Zvinchuk, a prominent blogger close to the Russian defence ministry, said on social media platform RuTube in August that the defeat showed Wagner fighters who arrived from Ukraine had underestimated the rebels and the Al Qaeda fighters.MISSING IN ACTIONWagner-linked Telegram accounts named two of the dead as Nikita Fedyakin, the administrator of The Grey Zone, a popular Wagner-focused Telegram channel with over half a million subscribers, and Sergei Shevchenko, who the accounts described as the unit commander. Reuters could not verify the identity of Shevchenko.Reuters separately identified 23 Wagner operators missing in Mali via relatives who posted in an official Wagner Telegram chat group, checking the names against social media accounts, publicly available data and facial recognition software. All the relatives received calls from Wagner recruiters on Aug. 6 to notify them their men were missing in action, they said in the chat group.Lyubov Bazhenova told Reuters she had no idea her son Vladimir Akimov, 25, who had briefly served in Russia's elite airborne forces as a conscript, had signed up. She was angry with Wagner for sharing no further information about his fate or the whereabouts of his body. She said letters to the prosecutor's office, defence ministry and foreign ministry had gone unanswered.Facial-recognition software was used to identify another two men captured by Tuareg fighters, based on photographs and videos of the ambush site published by Tuareg sources. The Tuareg rebels posted videos and photos of the two captives on social media. Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, a spokesman for the rebel alliance, confirmed the men were in rebel captivity as of late August.One of the missing fighters, Alexei Kuzekmaev, 47, had no military experience, his wife Lyudmila Kuzekmaeva told Reuters.\"Neither my hysterics, nor tears, nor persuasion - nothing helped. He just confronted me a month before he left home. He said 'I bought a ticket and will be leaving.'\"Among the most experienced men was Alexander Lazarev, 48, a Russian army veteran who served in wars against Chechen separatists in the 1990s and 2000s, according to his wife's posts in the Wagner channel.She declined to comment. Lazarev appears in many photos on the Russian Facebook equivalent VKontakte wearing military uniform, with symbols linked to several army subdivisions.PARASTATAL MERCENARY FORCEDemocratic governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger were overthrown in a series of coups since 2020 driven by anger with corrupt leaders and a near decade of failed Western efforts to fight insurgencies that have killed thousands and displaced millions.The military juntas have kicked out French and U.S. troops and U.N. peacekeepers.In Africa, Wagner emerged in Sudan in 2017 as the deniable face of Russian operations. Its enterprises soon ranged from protecting African coup leaders to gold mining and fighting jihadists. Wagner is also active in Central African Republic. It first appeared in Mali in late 2021.Wagner's fortunes rose and fell last year. In May, the group led Russia to its first significant Ukrainian battlefield victory in almost a year with the capture of Bakhmut. But after his criticism of Russian military leaders and his effort to lead a rebellion weeks after the Bakhmut victory, Prigozhin died in a fiery plane crash in August.

However, rising temperatures caused by global warming have made protecting endangered species, such as snow leopards, a big challenge.The country has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half. According to a 2017 study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DOHM), Nepal's average annual maximum temperature has risen by 0.056 degrees Celsius. The study shows most districts have witnessed increasing temperatures each year, with hill and mountain districts witnessing a faster rise compared to the Tarai districts.“Protecting livestock—mountain goats, horses, mules, and yaks—has become increasingly challenging for farmers in Mustang and other mountain districts, which have been hardest hit by the climate crisis,” said Lal Bahadur Gurung, an expert on snow leopards. ‘‘The rising temperatures have increased incidents of human-wildlife conflicts in mountainous regions, and livestock are getting killed by both common and snow leopards.”It is estimated that there are around 400 snow leopards in Nepal out of fewer than 4,000 worldwide. Experts say snow leopards sometimes raid livestock barns during heavy snowfalls when prey becomes scarce, especially as they age and become weak. During such raids, they kill dozens of animals at once. Also, rising temperatures due to climate change are driving common leopards to higher altitudes, further increasing the threat to livestock.Multiple stakeholders have set up mechanisms to protect endangered species like snow leopards by reducing human-wildlife conflicts. But affected livestock farmers complained that these efforts only add to their misery.“I got nothing from anyone—not from the insurance company, the local government, or any of the agencies involved in snow leopard conservation,” complained Santosh Pariyar, another resident from ward 2 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality who lost 27 mountain goats in a snow leopard attack. “The insurance company wanted photos of the snow leopard carrying off my goats, along with tags as proof. Local officials asked me to show where the dead goats were buried.”Many livestock farmers the Post spoke to voiced similar frustrations, saying the mechanisms meant to reduce human-wildlife conflicts are overly problematic and too mechanical, which is fuelling growing resentment towards snow leopards.“Who would not be angry when dozens of livestock are killed at once,” said Anil Adhikari, executive director of the Teka Samuha Nepal, a non-profit that runs a community-based snow leopard conservation project in six local units in Mustang.“Unless we make the mechanisms set up for lessening human-wildlife conflict more farmer-friendly and provide compensation on time, we cannot expect the intended results.”Adhikari claimed that retaliatory killings of snow leopards, which used to be a major challenge to conservation efforts, have declined thanks to years of awareness efforts. He also said that farmers' growing frustration with the authorities' lackadaisical approach to compensation is a lingering issue. “Getting compensation from insurance companies and other authorities concerned is too difficult,” said Niraj Thakali, a local from Jomsom, Mustang. “First of all, most herders cannot gather all the required proof—photos of the leopard attack, insurance tags, and so on. Second, the compensation amount is so small that selling the meat of the dead animals is often more profitable than filing an insurance claim. And even when you file a claim, it takes months to receive the payment.” Thakali, an activist involved in snow leopard conservation, said that he too lost three horses a few months ago, but chose not to file an insurance claim, as he knows it is not easy to complete all bureaucratic procedures.“There is a growing awareness among locals that we shouldn’t kill snow leopards, even if they prey on our livestock,” said Sabi Thakali, a local from Thini village in ward 5 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality in Mustang. “The authorities need to step up and provide compensation promptly, if they want us to continue protecting these animals.” ","summary":"Til Bahadur Pariyar, a resident of Marpha in ward 2 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality in the mountain district of Mustang, complained that snow leopards killed 60 of his mountain goats over the last three years.A few months ago, he lost three horses to a common leopard, which has been moving into the mountainous region lately due to the warming climate.“Earlier, we only had to guard our livestock against snow leopards, but now common leopards also kill our animals,” complained Pariyar. “Many livestock farmers have already abandoned the profession due to the growing threat from predators—snow leopards and common leopards.”Nepal is among the 12 countries that are home to snow leopards and has committed to protecting the species, its prey, and its habitats.

Harnessing waste biomass could cut the country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption, according to the paper entitled ‘Possibilities and challenges for converting waste biomass into fuel, feed, and fertiliser in Nepal’.Most of Nepal’s waste biomass is used conventionally, such as for kitchen fuel and animal feed, without proper valorisation. This is a pressing issue as open dumping and burning, particularly of municipal waste, is a common practice in Nepal, according to the paper, with detrimental effects on the overall ecosystem.“Our study estimates the potential of about 89 million tonnes of waste biomass annually in Nepal, mainly from the agriculture, municipal, livestock, fowl, and human sectors,” said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.“We have revealed the potential at the sub-national level in Nepal, highlighting its possibilities and challenges for converting the fuel, feed, and fertilisers,” said Kafle, who is currently pursuing PhD at Auburn University, US.The paper estimates that through the conversion of waste biomass, Nepal can produce about 1.7 to 5.0 million tonnes of pellet or briquette and biochar, 1.7 to 5.1 million tonnes of feed block, 129 to 387 million cubic metres of biogas, and 0.6 to 1.9 million tonnes of fertiliser.“These valuable products can have significant environmental and economic benefits,” the paper said.Waste biomass is generated from different sources, such as forestry residue, agriculture crop residue, municipal organic waste, and livestock waste. Improper management of such residue and waste negatively impacts overall biodiversity, a growing global concern. For example, the poor handling and management of municipal solid waste, mainly generated from the urban sector, pollutes the surroundings and impacts overall biodiversity, including human health. Its management is one of the significant challenges for the relevant authorities, as it needs resources.Municipal solid waste, comprising more than half of organic waste in developing countries, is being dumped and burned openly in Nepal.Similarly, open burning of crop residues, especially paddy straw, is practised in Nepal, resulting in air pollution. This practice is particularly prominent in the Tarai, where combined harvesters scatter straw across the fields, making collection impractical. Farmers often burn the straw as they find it economically unviable to collect and meet the next cropping season. Livestock manures generate methane during decomposition, contributing to global warming. However, anaerobic digestion technology could trap and utilise this gas as energy.Also, improper management of human waste—urine and faeces—pollutes soil and groundwater, affecting human health. Although the country has declared itself free from open defecation, dumping raw sewage and septic tank waste into rivers is common in Nepal. Due to the lack of proper conversion knowledge and technology and the unavailability of status data, the waste biomass is improperly managed or conventionally used in many developing countries. The conventional use of waste biomass is less efficient, hazardous to the environment, and does not generate economic growth. For example, using dry dung cake instead of biogas for cooking fuel is less efficient, degrades indoor air quality, and impacts human health. The lack of data generation, consumption, and availability hinders policymaking and planning for the biomass-based industry.Some houses also have toilets connected to biogas plants. In the fiscal year 2020-21 alone, about 3,975 biogas plants were installed in Nepal. This shows that waste biomass is utilised in modern ways, such as producing biogas.

These challenges need to be addressed to promote waste biomass-based industries in Nepal,” said Pradhan. ","summary":"Nepal has huge waste potential for biomass, a resource that can significantly boost the economy if correctly managed and valorised, according to a new research paper. Harnessing waste biomass could cut the country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption, according to the paper entitled ‘Possibilities and challenges for converting waste biomass into fuel, feed, and fertiliser in Nepal’.Most of Nepal’s waste biomass is used conventionally, such as for kitchen fuel and animal feed, without proper valorisation. This is a pressing issue as open dumping and burning, particularly of municipal waste, is a common practice in Nepal, according to the paper, with detrimental effects on the overall ecosystem.“Our study estimates the potential of about 89 million tonnes of waste biomass annually in Nepal, mainly from the agriculture, municipal, livestock, fowl, and human sectors,” said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.“We have revealed the potential at the sub-national level in Nepal, highlighting its possibilities and challenges for converting the fuel, feed, and fertilisers,” said Kafle, who is currently pursuing PhD at Auburn University, US.The paper estimates that through the conversion of waste biomass, Nepal can produce about 1.7 to 5.0 million tonnes of pellet or briquette and biochar, 1.7 to 5.1 million tonnes of feed block, 129 to 387 million cubic metres of biogas, and 0.6 to 1.9 million tonnes of fertiliser.“These valuable products can have significant environmental and economic benefits,” the paper said.Waste biomass is generated from different sources, such as forestry residue, agriculture crop residue, municipal organic waste, and livestock waste. Improper management of such residue and waste negatively impacts overall biodiversity, a growing global concern. For example, the poor handling and management of municipal solid waste, mainly generated from the urban sector, pollutes the surroundings and impacts overall biodiversity, including human health. Its management is one of the significant challenges for the relevant authorities, as it needs resources.Municipal solid waste, comprising more than half of organic waste in developing countries, is being dumped and burned openly in Nepal.Similarly, open burning of crop residues, especially paddy straw, is practised in Nepal, resulting in air pollution. This practice is particularly prominent in the Tarai, where combined harvesters scatter straw across the fields, making collection impractical. Farmers often burn the straw as they find it economically unviable to collect and meet the next cropping season. Livestock manures generate methane during decomposition, contributing to global warming. However, anaerobic digestion technology could trap and utilise this gas as energy.Also, improper management of human waste—urine and faeces—pollutes soil and groundwater, affecting human health. Although the country has declared itself free from open defecation, dumping raw sewage and septic tank waste into rivers is common in Nepal. Due to the lack of proper conversion knowledge and technology and the unavailability of status data, the waste biomass is improperly managed or conventionally used in many developing countries. The conventional use of waste biomass is less efficient, hazardous to the environment, and does not generate economic growth. For example, using dry dung cake instead of biogas for cooking fuel is less efficient, degrades indoor air quality, and impacts human health. The lack of data generation, consumption, and availability hinders policymaking and planning for the biomass-based industry.Some houses also have toilets connected to biogas plants. In the fiscal year 2020-21 alone, about 3,975 biogas plants were installed in Nepal. This shows that waste biomass is utilised in modern ways, such as producing biogas. However, the majority is still untapped and is conventionally used or managed poorly.Proper utilisation of such waste biomass needs quantification at the subnational level, which will help develop innovative industries for sustainable development, such as by enhancing the local economy, creating jobs and increasing the share of renewable energy.The study’s findings are significant and show enormous waste potential in the Tarai, especially in Morang district of Koshi Province. Prof Sushil Adhikari, co-author of the study and professor at Auburn University, highlighted the opportunities for producing fuel, feed, and fertilisers from such waste biomass. “The pellets and briquettes produced from waste biomass could effectively replace coal in thermal power industries such as brick and cement.

But soon they met Prakash, or Paka, a shadow figure living in oblivion for over three decades in the valley after being lost from Kathmandu. He had only hazy memories of his family and home in Jhapa, and his real name—Kale Tamang. The Herne Katha team soon began tracing his footsteps back to Jhapa. Along the journey, Paka’s memories of his childhood, his family and his home came back alive in bits and pieces. Ultimately, he found his family back—in Jhapa, where his sisters lived, and in Bhojpur, where his parents and brothers had resettled. On the eighth day of its premiere, as “The Lost Years” had reached 8.7 million views on YouTube, Paka had risen as a folk hero and the Herne Katha team garnered accolades and criticisms aplenty. A curious mixture of his destiny and Herne Katha’s storytelling helped him find home. But long after Herne Katha stopped rolling, his story continues to unravel. From a story, he is slowly metamorphosing into a content as he is being pushed towards uncharted territories. The return from social media-fed stardom to reality is rather troublesome and tragic—as we have seen in the case of the young Sachin Pariyar. Known for his quirky humour and mediocre singing, Sachin became an overnight sensation. Soon, his broken family became a feed for content creators; his father, nicknamed Kaloute, became a celebrated villain; and the child was made to beg on the streets of Kathmandu. The estrangementAs Paka metamorphoses into a subject for content creators, he is quickly losing the plot of his story. As YouTubers seek newness in their content, Paka will be encouraged to fabricate his hardships and seek financial support—things he had hardly ever done before. In no time, having repeated the fabrications on camera umpteen times, he will learn to believe them, even become obsessed with them. Questions about the inconsistencies in his plotline will follow, and he will have to supplement fabrications with lies. In no time, Paka will have lost touch with his story. Unless another good samaritan jumps in to save Paka from the viral infection of social media-driven stardom, this is more or less his trajectory in the next few weeks. There are some tell-tale signs of Paka’s downfall already: His parents have already started crying in front of YouTubers; his brother has already started reciting stale chutkilas; local politicians have offered him land to build a home; provincial and federal government representatives have promised to help him; and the common public have begun garlanding him and offering him money. The man who had mastered the art of living in the mountains will soon be tutored in the art of lying in front of the camera. Negotiating the journey from innocence to experience is often more difficult than spending cold winter nights in the company of yaks and sheep. Finding home should never be accompanied by the loss of self, but that is what happens when the story loses its plot. The spectacleThe history of the media is a story of fabrications. Folklores and myths, poetry and prose, or stories and reels, all depend on some bit of fabrication by the media that bear them—oral, visual, or tactile. The heroes we celebrate or the villains we loathe have all come to us through some sort of fabrications by the media ecosystem. From cave paintings' exaggeration of Neanderthal life to ChatGPT's fabrication about the books this author has not written, media of all forms exist in the interstitial space between truth and falsity. No wonder that Bidhya Chapagain and her Herne Katha team were criticised for \"fabricating\" Paka's story of hardship. Rather than wait for over a year to sell his story, we are told, the makers should have yelled about it into the ears of the authorities—meaning the exploitative system—for punitive action. If nothing, they should have at least asked difficult questions to Paka's master who had kept him without pay for over three decades.In the normative sense of action-oriented journalism, the criticisms against Herne Katha are not unfounded. A deeper probing into what led to Paka's misery would certainly have led to greater accountability from his master and the systems that disallow people like him from finding their way home. But not every story that involves a camera, a voiceover and a character is journalism, much less investigative journalism. Though with backgrounds in journalism, the Herne Katha team, in identifying themselves as storytellers, have not, at least now, made any serious claim to being activist-journalists. Rather, their interest seems to be in bearing witness and telling a good story. Everybody loves a good story, no matter whether it is that of selling dreams or shedding tears. Unless they resort to sensationalism and journalistic grandstanding, a bit of melodrama narrating the bittersweet story of a man lost in the mountains for 30 years is no big deal. But Paka's story is quickly becoming a public spectacle, and there is a risk of him losing his very being.   ","summary":"A year and a half ago, Bidhya Chapagain and her team of Herne Katha (Seeing Stories) visited the distant Chum Valley in Gorkha District to follow the story of Phunjo Lama.

What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles. Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination.

According to party insiders, a group of dissidents has intensified activities with a plan to split the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), and to return to the mother party–CPN-UML.The dissidents are reportedly in negotiations with top UML leaders after they were either not selected as candidates or were defeated in the election of office bearers and Politburo members of the Unified Socialist.“Though I am not fully aware of dissident leaders’ recent moves, several leaders are not satisfied with the party, especially after the election of the office bearers,” said Keshav Lal Shrestha, who fought for the position of deputy party chair and got defeated.“Electing the party office bearers was not the mandate of the delegates to the general convention,” Shrestha told the Post.“In the Unified Socialist, there were various groups based on their opinions. To strengthen the newly formed party, we had agreed to choose the leadership in consensus. However, when the top three leaders were selected unanimously, they later decided to hold the election of office bearers, against the convention’s mandate.” During the election, top leaders issued different lists asking party representatives to elect those candidates as office bearers, Shrestha said. “When the party's top leaders themselves are guided by factional motives and cannot unify party members, why would other leaders still want to continue as party members?”Even though Shrestha did not admit that he was considering quitting the Unified Socialist, he didn’t deny that some party leaders were considering the move.The party's general convention, held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 5, unanimously elected Madhav Nepal the chairman, Ghanashyam Bhusal general secretary, and Jhala Nath Khanal senior leader.After the general convention unanimously elected the chairman and general secretary, they had announced to pick office bearers in consensus. However, party insiders said leaders close to Nepal lobbied hard to hold an election for office bearers considering the party establishment’s strong hold on the party organisation.During the office bearers’ election on August 27, the Nepal-Bhusal camp contested some vital positions, and the Nepal camp leader won most of them.After being defeated as vice-chair, Ramkumari Jhakri, Ramchandra Jha, Keshav Lal Shrestha, and deputy general secretary candidates Amar Bahadur Thapa, Jeevanram Shrestha, and other leaders are allegedly considering rejoining their mother party, CPN-UML, according to a party insider. Jhakri, who played a vital role in establishing the Unified Socialist in 2021, has for the last couple of months been lobbying for the party’s merger with the CPN-UML.In an interview with the Post just ahead of the election, Jhakri acknowledged that the party should consider unification with the mother party, UML.However, Jhakri on Sunday said that despite some leaders’ grievances towards the party leadership, there are slim chances of the party being split as yet.“The way the party leaders are handling the party’s affairs has caused disenchantment within the organisation,” Jhakri told the Post. However, she denied that the dissident leaders were considering a break-up.“We are in regular touch with some of the dissident leaders of the party, as reported in the media, but they are not in a mood to split the party,” says Somnath Pandey, a party secretary. “The rumour of the party split spread mainly after three of the federal lawmakers of our party were not involved in the party’s election process,” Pandey told the Post. “But see no such possibility.”Prem Ale, Kishan Shrestha, and Dhan Bahadur Budha, three of the party's ten lawmakers, do not currently hold any of the party positions. When Shrestha and Budha were the party's central members, Ale did not renew his membership.Pandey claimed that Jhakri is one of the party leaders who has considered quitting. Jhakri said she had just arrived from Qatar after attending a function as a party leader, meaning that she was yet to get updates.If there are some grievances of leaders, the party will try to solve them, Pandey said.Jha, who is considered as a dissident leader, also denied that he was planning to quit the party. “I have some reservations over how the election of office bearers was conducted,” Jha told the Post. “The party's top leadership circulated lists of the leaders to be elected, which was a wrong practice. But I have my differences with the UML too, so there is no possibility of me rejoining the old party.”Jha said that since Ale, Shrestha, and Budha are directly elected lawmakers, they might have some issues with the party for not selecting them ministers when the party was in power. “Other leaders should have no issues.”Ashesh Ghimire, a Politburo member, dismissed the talk as rumour. “Yes, there certainly is gossip that some of our party leaders are considering rejoining the UML, but this won’t happen as outsiders expect,” Ghimire told the Post. “It has been reported that some of our party leaders also met with UML chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli but this is unsubstantiated.” However, party insiders also claimed that in his meeting with some Unified Socialist leaders, Prime Minister Oli reportedly said that the government, before Dashain, will introduce an ordinance related to the political parties, making it easier for the dissidents to split the Unified Socialist. Ramsaran Bajgain, press coordinator for Prime Minister Oli, however, rubbished the claim. “The government is not considering issuing any ordinance to split a party at the moment,” Bajgain told the Post. Splitting a party currently has legal ambiguities. The Political Parties Act states that a group of party dissidents can split the organisation and form a new party if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members as well as at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.In August 2021, the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government issued the ordinance and changed the provision, enabling 20 percent of the central committee and 20 percent of lawmakers to form a new party. The law was then tweaked to help then-UML leader Madhav Nepal and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal’s Mahantha Thakur launch their parties. However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, immediately after the two parties split. After that, the government did not replace the ordinance, causing a legal void. Despite the legal ambiguities regarding the party's split, a group of leaders led by Ashok Rai of JSP-Nepal had split the party. With the support of six other lawmakers and 35 central committee members, Rai had split the party.Their party’s legal status is still unclear as their move to split the party has been challenged in the Supreme Court and the case is still sub judice.

He urged the Maoist leadership to stop glorifying such violence and asked them to be part of national development.The verbal war between the leaders of Oli’s party and the Maoist Centre intensified after lawmaker and UML Secretary Yogesh Bhattarai said in Parliament that the decade-long war waged by the Maoists against the state was “unfortunate”. In the House session on August 28, Bhattarai repeatedly termed the Maoist insurgency “violence”.“If the Maoist war was great, why did they abandon it?” Oli said days later. “Why did they join the peace process?

Later the peaceful movement became successful.”In one speech in Parliament, former prime minister Dahal warned that the fate of Nepali leaders could be similar to those of the ruling party leaders in Bangladesh as the recent incidents show and in Sri Lanka two years ago. Dahal went on to say that if the governing alliance of the Nepali Congress and the UML fails to address public aspirations, Nepal could face situations like in the two other South Asian nations.“You, not me, should learn from a lesson from Bangladesh,” Oli said, responding to Dahal, at an event on August 31. “Just yesterday, Prachanda ji [Dahal] reportedly advised me to learn lessons from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. But have I killed 17,000 people so I would tremble with fear? Have I robbed the people?”Oli continued, “I do not need to fear anyone. It is Dahal who must learn from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.”Oli also ruled out the possibility of Nepal becoming the next Sri Lanka or Bangladesh as Nepal’s history and tradition are different from those of the South Asian neighbours.At a function organised in Tundikhel on August 26 to mark Gaura Parva, some youths chanted slogans against Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. That caused worries among Nepali leaders and analysts that growing frustration among the Nepali youths could lead to a political disaster in Nepal.The growing rift between the UML and the Maoist Centre has been discussed in both the parties. The two communist forces formed an alliance ahead of the parliamentary elections in 2017. The next year, they merged to become the largest party and governed the country for three years.But the unity between the UML and the Maoist Centre did not last long.

On the other hand, the Congress, which joined forces with the Maoist Centre and other parties during the last elections, has also decided to contest the elections single-handedly. “The decisions of the Nepali Congress and the UML to contest the elections on their own have come as big shocks for the Maoist Centre. So they are venting ire against us,” the UML leader said.Meanwhile, the Maoist Centre has issued a circular to its rank and file to be ready for street protests.

Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” ","summary":"On September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years.

As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” "},{"hash":"6dc2ac64a0cb1c1b1fcd8ee6089b56dd071004f367e93270b182e05e8ff6f031","title":"hoax-bomb-causes-panic-in-chandragiri","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2024/08/22/hoax-bomb-causes-panic-in-chandragiri","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb3-1724310597.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1724284800000,"source":"kp","category":"valley","content":"Panic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging.

The price of the major kitchen staple has increased due to the rise in India, Nepal’s key source market.According to Indian media reports, onion prices have risen to over IRs70 per kg in retail in Delhi and IRs80 per kg in other regions.With retail onion prices now hovering over 47 percent higher than a year ago, India’s Union Food Minister Pralhad Joshi flagged off vans of two government cooperatives—the National Cooperative Consumer’s Federation (NCCF) and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation—to sell onions at IRs35 per kg.The Indian central government typically steps in when prices of onions, a politically sensitive commodity, start to climb. Every year, in the latter part of the monsoon, the onion crop gets damaged in key producing areas, leading to scarcity and price rises.The price increase in India has a direct impact on Nepal, which is heavily dependent on onion imports from its southern neighbour.Onions are cultivated three times a year in India—in monsoon, winter and summer.According to the comparative price index of the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the wholesale price of onion has increased by 20.32 percent within a month and by 71.29 percent within a year.On Monday, the wholesale price of onion in the Kalimati market was Rs128 per kg, compared to around Rs70 per kg a year ago.In retail, it costs Rs170 to Rs180 per kg.“The price has increased in India, which automatically affects the price in the Nepali market,” said Mohan Baniya, president of the Potato-Onion Import-Export and Wholesaler Association. “The price will start to cool down once the new harvest starts arriving in the Nepali market,” he said, adding that it would take a month for the new harvest to come in. “Until then, the wholesale price will hover around Rs130 per kg.” Traders say that in retail, onion may reach Rs200 per kg due to customs duties and other taxes.“In India, onions cost around Rs65 per kg, and after adding Rs45 customs duty, it costs Rs110, excluding transportation,” said Baniya.For consumers, price hikes on essential commodities, especially when the festival is around the corner, are a major concern.“Without onion, it is impossible to prepare many dishes,” said Banshi Acharya, a resident of Ravi Bhawan, who was buying vegetables in the Kalimati market on Saturday.“The price of daily essentials increases even with mere rumours. This shows a failure in the government’s ability to control market malpractices.”Onion arrivals in the Kalimati market have declined by 31.77 percent within a month. The market received 24 tonnes of onion on Friday.Onion imports declined by 68.14 percent in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July, compared to the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 51,544 tonnes of onions worth Rs2.15 billion in the last fiscal year.The Indian government banned onion exports in December last year and lifted the ban in May. However, India imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne, which caused a price hike in onions.Despite the five-month ban, the supply of onions in the Nepali vegetable market remained stable as onions continued to arrive through informal channels, traders say. “Despite the ban, prices stayed stable due to rampant smuggling.”In the last fiscal year, after the government imposed a 13 percent VAT on vegetables, including onions and potatoes, there were substantial price differences for onions in Nepal and India, which fuelled informal cross-border trade of onions, according to several reports. Nepal Police seized thousands of tonnes of onion smuggled in through the southern border, the reports say.Prices, eventually, started to cool down as smuggling surged.Even though Nepali customs officials regularly inspect the border, onions continued to be smuggled, particularly on motorbikes.According to research titled ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west.“India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher,” the research says.

Every year, in the latter part of the monsoon, the onion crop gets damaged in key producing areas, leading to scarcity and price rises.The price increase in India has a direct impact on Nepal, which is heavily dependent on onion imports from its southern neighbour.Onions are cultivated three times a year in India—in monsoon, winter and summer.According to the comparative price index of the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the wholesale price of onion has increased by 20.32 percent within a month and by 71.29 percent within a year.On Monday, the wholesale price of onion in the Kalimati market was Rs128 per kg, compared to around Rs70 per kg a year ago.In retail, it costs Rs170 to Rs180 per kg.“The price has increased in India, which automatically affects the price in the Nepali market,” said Mohan Baniya, president of the Potato-Onion Import-Export and Wholesaler Association. “The price will start to cool down once the new harvest starts arriving in the Nepali market,” he said, adding that it would take a month for the new harvest to come in. “Until then, the wholesale price will hover around Rs130 per kg.” Traders say that in retail, onion may reach Rs200 per kg due to customs duties and other taxes.“In India, onions cost around Rs65 per kg, and after adding Rs45 customs duty, it costs Rs110, excluding transportation,” said Baniya.For consumers, price hikes on essential commodities, especially when the festival is around the corner, are a major concern.“Without onion, it is impossible to prepare many dishes,” said Banshi Acharya, a resident of Ravi Bhawan, who was buying vegetables in the Kalimati market on Saturday.“The price of daily essentials increases even with mere rumours. This shows a failure in the government’s ability to control market malpractices.”Onion arrivals in the Kalimati market have declined by 31.77 percent within a month. The market received 24 tonnes of onion on Friday.Onion imports declined by 68.14 percent in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July, compared to the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 51,544 tonnes of onions worth Rs2.15 billion in the last fiscal year.The Indian government banned onion exports in December last year and lifted the ban in May. However, India imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne, which caused a price hike in onions.Despite the five-month ban, the supply of onions in the Nepali vegetable market remained stable as onions continued to arrive through informal channels, traders say. “Despite the ban, prices stayed stable due to rampant smuggling.”In the last fiscal year, after the government imposed a 13 percent VAT on vegetables, including onions and potatoes, there were substantial price differences for onions in Nepal and India, which fuelled informal cross-border trade of onions, according to several reports. Nepal Police seized thousands of tonnes of onion smuggled in through the southern border, the reports say.Prices, eventually, started to cool down as smuggling surged.Even though Nepali customs officials regularly inspect the border, onions continued to be smuggled, particularly on motorbikes.According to research titled ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west.“India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher,” the research says.

According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with the same genus as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The case-fatality rate among those infected can be as high as 30 percent. Permanent neurologic, cognitive, and behavioural sequelae occur in 30 to 50 percent of those with encephalitis, according to the UN health body.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so they provide only symptomatic treatment. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent the JE infection. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people die and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.The Health Directorate of Sudurpaschim Province, reported that two patients—a nine-year-old boy from ward 5 and a 60-year-old man from ward 6 of Ghodaghodi Municipality of the district—died from the infection.“The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out serological tests, confirmed the virus in both deceased and infected patients,” Dr Khagendra Bam, acting director of the directorate, told the Post over the phone from Doti. “Four others receiving treatment at hospitals are from adjoining Gauriganga Municipality, and their conditions are stable.”Officials say they are currently collecting data on under-five children to administer the vaccine. However, officials at the Health Ministry said that there are no immediate plans for additional vaccination drives in the disease-hit areas.“Deaths and infections from JE are reported every year, as the disease is endemic in our country,” said Gautam. “But the number of deaths and infections has significantly decreased compared to the past.”Officials said that in the past, dozens of people would die, and around 600 would be infected by the JE virus each year. Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.

It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease.

Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. ","summary":"Seriously ill patients at District Hospital Sankhuwasabha are squeezed into every available space besides the beds: corridors, the floor, chairs, and even the storeroom, and outside on the hospital compound.With the spike in new cases of water-borne, viral fever and vector-borne diseases, mostly dengue, the hospital is struggling to cope.“Every day, around two dozen seriously ill patients end up sleeping on the corridor floor and in other areas,” Dr Pranam Jayaru, medical superintendent at the district hospital, told the Post over the phone from Khandbari, the district headquarters. “Our health workers have been working overtime to provide care, but we lack even the most basic supplies like IV stands. Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death.

The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

","summary":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley "},{"hash":"c077b34beda2250a997231f215f178053a057340c5c72de0aec15b25ae40ddb7","title":"old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/11/18/old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2023/third-party/phidim%20main%20(1).JPG&w=900&height=601","date":1700265600000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

From democratic socialists to moderate Leftists to Marxists and Bolsheviks to Bolivarans, all dream of establishing a classless society under a single-party dictatorship. Not being a socialist in this country is a political sacrilege and, ostensibly, becoming anti-development, if not outrightly anti-national. Nevertheless, almost all of these pipe dreamers have accepted the “mainstream” adult franchise-based parliamentary democracy.Not being socialist also (perhaps) goes against the Constitution. This is because, in at least three instances, The Constitution of Nepal 2015 categorically mentions the term “socialism” while defining the nature of the Nepali state. The preamble states that the constitution was issued as its formulator, the Constituent Assembly, was “committed to socialism”. Article 4(1) defines the State of Nepal as “an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive, democratic, socialism-oriented, federal democratic republican state”. Under the Directive Principles (Article 50, Clause 3), the objective of the State is “to develop a socialism-oriented independent and prosperous economy.” Tragically, the constitution has skipped the definition of the term “socialism”, making it a paradise for the interpretation of convenience.Political stunts often resurface to save socialism from falling from grace. When Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was prime minister, he formed a socialist front last January, including three other left parties—Janata Samajbadi Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Biplov). Now out of power, Dahal is trying to bring other fringe parties into the fold for a more organised opposition to the current government. There have been several efforts in history to unite the so-called socialists. But in practice, opportunism has homogenised Nepal’s every political outfit into a power-hungry brute force without principle, let alone ideology. The travesty, however, is that the fundamental allegation to demean one party by the other, mainly among the communist parties, is “the blatant abandonment of the principles of socialism.”Outdated narrativesSocialism takes refuge in utterly outdated socioeconomics and ecopolitical narratives for its survival. The overarching prescription is that the state must not only provide free health and education but also reduce the private sector’s role in the economy. The constitution includes free education up to the secondary level, free basic health care and gainful employment as fundamental rights. The socialists see all economic and political ills as the outcome of engulfing trends of liberalisation and globalisation. They still advocate for land reform that ensures entitlement of the “land to the tiller”. However, in reality, the younger generation is unwilling to own farms as they are moving away from agriculture to modern sectors of employment and entrepreneurship. Huge amounts of fertile land are increasingly being left uncultivated for want of people opting for farming. Besides, the unplanned drive of land fragmentation has converted entire farmlands into unfeasible patches for commercial-scale production of agricultural products. Failed land use planning and haphazard urbanisation have further eroded the prospects of the land used for agriculture.The pro-socialist crusade may not have appeared vocal to stop the privatisation of highly loss-making state-owned enterprises, stall private sector economic reforms and discontinue the centralised planning process, but they have crept into every aspect of economic policy-making. As a result, the economy is persistently left without a development model, and growth has stagnated beyond endurance. Nepal’s market integration with even the regional market is very limited, and the economy, seemingly irreversibly, becomes import-dependent, draining out capital and young brains.RamificationsThe discourse itself is anachronistic. The political parties are not competing to be forward-looking and pro-reform but to prove themselves purer socialists than others. This is rapidly disconnecting the political parties from the political system the country has adopted at a great opportunity cost and from the economic system that must generate output to increase public well-being.Philosophically, socialism with intended control of the state is the opposite pole to federalism, which seeks to devolve political and economic power closer to the masses. But most of Nepal’s political parties are playing devout socialists and ardent federalists. So, it is no surprise that federalism has been able to produce only suboptimal results during the last seven years of its implementation. The subnational political and administrative units created akin to the federal setup for all practical purposes remain subservient to the power concentrated at the centre. The concept of the controlling “central” government is finding it hard to convert into a coordinating “federal” government.The socialist idea of every facility being financed by the state certainly looks benign on the surface. This simply means the state treasury has to be adequately filled and continuously replenished to fulfil all existing public demands for services and facilities and be enough to meet future aspirations for improved quality of life. Without a reliable revenue source, the state can neither finance better public delivery nor develop infrastructure for the future. Nepal is now exactly in this trap.The real paradox of the socialist model of state-managed economy lies exactly here. Revenue on a convincing scale can only be generated if private sector investment substantially increases productivity, profit, employment and personal income. The state financing everything, even if it becomes a basic right included in the constitution, is impossible without making the market economy sizable, vibrant and capable of paying taxes. Such a market is impossible to imagine without unhindered private sector investment. Foreign investment is the new paradigm in the economies with comparative advantage. However, the very idea of a state-controlled socialist economy is perhaps enough to turn the heads of foreign investors away from the economy in question.Even Karl Marx’s Das Kapital advocated for the highest level of capital growth for extreme exploitation to explode into revolution. However, Nepali socialists didn't even recognise the importance of the inevitable expansion of capital for a state. The state apparatus has evolved since Marx to prevent extreme exploitation. Also, capitalists need not be exterminated by violence but can be constructively made liable to duly paying tax to the state.   ","summary":"Even in the era of the meteoric rise of ultra-right politics globally, Nepal is among a few countries whose politics is dominated by socialists of different shades. From democratic socialists to moderate Leftists to Marxists and Bolsheviks to Bolivarans, all dream of establishing a classless society under a single-party dictatorship. Not being a socialist in this country is a political sacrilege and, ostensibly, becoming anti-development, if not outrightly anti-national. Nevertheless, almost all of these pipe dreamers have accepted the “mainstream” adult franchise-based parliamentary democracy.Not being socialist also (perhaps) goes against the Constitution. This is because, in at least three instances, The Constitution of Nepal 2015 categorically mentions the term “socialism” while defining the nature of the Nepali state. The preamble states that the constitution was issued as its formulator, the Constituent Assembly, was “committed to socialism”. Article 4(1) defines the State of Nepal as “an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive, democratic, socialism-oriented, federal democratic republican state”. Under the Directive Principles (Article 50, Clause 3), the objective of the State is “to develop a socialism-oriented independent and prosperous economy.” Tragically, the constitution has skipped the definition of the term “socialism”, making it a paradise for the interpretation of convenience.Political stunts often resurface to save socialism from falling from grace. When Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was prime minister, he formed a socialist front last January, including three other left parties—Janata Samajbadi Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Biplov). Now out of power, Dahal is trying to bring other fringe parties into the fold for a more organised opposition to the current government. There have been several efforts in history to unite the so-called socialists. But in practice, opportunism has homogenised Nepal’s every political outfit into a power-hungry brute force without principle, let alone ideology. The travesty, however, is that the fundamental allegation to demean one party by the other, mainly among the communist parties, is “the blatant abandonment of the principles of socialism.”Outdated narrativesSocialism takes refuge in utterly outdated socioeconomics and ecopolitical narratives for its survival. The overarching prescription is that the state must not only provide free health and education but also reduce the private sector’s role in the economy. The constitution includes free education up to the secondary level, free basic health care and gainful employment as fundamental rights. The socialists see all economic and political ills as the outcome of engulfing trends of liberalisation and globalisation. They still advocate for land reform that ensures entitlement of the “land to the tiller”. However, in reality, the younger generation is unwilling to own farms as they are moving away from agriculture to modern sectors of employment and entrepreneurship. Huge amounts of fertile land are increasingly being left uncultivated for want of people opting for farming. Besides, the unplanned drive of land fragmentation has converted entire farmlands into unfeasible patches for commercial-scale production of agricultural products. Failed land use planning and haphazard urbanisation have further eroded the prospects of the land used for agriculture.The pro-socialist crusade may not have appeared vocal to stop the privatisation of highly loss-making state-owned enterprises, stall private sector economic reforms and discontinue the centralised planning process, but they have crept into every aspect of economic policy-making. As a result, the economy is persistently left without a development model, and growth has stagnated beyond endurance. Nepal’s market integration with even the regional market is very limited, and the economy, seemingly irreversibly, becomes import-dependent, draining out capital and young brains.RamificationsThe discourse itself is anachronistic. The political parties are not competing to be forward-looking and pro-reform but to prove themselves purer socialists than others. This is rapidly disconnecting the political parties from the political system the country has adopted at a great opportunity cost and from the economic system that must generate output to increase public well-being.Philosophically, socialism with intended control of the state is the opposite pole to federalism, which seeks to devolve political and economic power closer to the masses. But most of Nepal’s political parties are playing devout socialists and ardent federalists. So, it is no surprise that federalism has been able to produce only suboptimal results during the last seven years of its implementation. The subnational political and administrative units created akin to the federal setup for all practical purposes remain subservient to the power concentrated at the centre. The concept of the controlling “central” government is finding it hard to convert into a coordinating “federal” government.The socialist idea of every facility being financed by the state certainly looks benign on the surface. This simply means the state treasury has to be adequately filled and continuously replenished to fulfil all existing public demands for services and facilities and be enough to meet future aspirations for improved quality of life. Without a reliable revenue source, the state can neither finance better public delivery nor develop infrastructure for the future. Nepal is now exactly in this trap.The real paradox of the socialist model of state-managed economy lies exactly here. Revenue on a convincing scale can only be generated if private sector investment substantially increases productivity, profit, employment and personal income. The state financing everything, even if it becomes a basic right included in the constitution, is impossible without making the market economy sizable, vibrant and capable of paying taxes. Such a market is impossible to imagine without unhindered private sector investment. Foreign investment is the new paradigm in the economies with comparative advantage.

But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. ","summary":"Nepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition.

Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepal’s nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepal’s transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Court’s order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top court’s directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a ‘zero draft’ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victims’ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victims’ consent mandatory. If a victim doesn’t want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top court’s directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the court’s directives. I can’t say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said ‘so and so’ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isn’t this akin to directing the court? Wouldn’t it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. It’s already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the country’s transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldn’t even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepal’s peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the ‘zero draft’ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didn’t the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Don’t you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldn’t we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldn’t be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Don’t you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this.

Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. ","summary":"Lately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly.

Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  ","summary":"CPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021.

But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. ","summary":"The CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution?
