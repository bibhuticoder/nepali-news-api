There was a sense of assurance that a naturally rich country like Nepal won't face any impact of climate change. Some knowledgeable individuals would cite an example of early blooming of roses as an impact of climate change. Normal people often argue that if beans didn't bear on time, they would say it was because of climate change. If there was unseasonal rain causing floods, they would blame it on climate change. Whether there was enough evidence for this or not, everyone would confidently assert that climate change was the cause, or they would agree with the opinion without much thought and interactions. We all have heard and noticed such trends.Initially, it seemed unrealistic, but it turned out to be true. Climate change often considered as climate crisis has now become a major matter of discussion, not only in Nepal but as worldwide. Every year, in response to this issue, Nepali delegations including government officials and activists attend international conferences such as COP 28 to voice the effect of climate change that has already causing significant impact to Nepalese farmers and demanding for compensation due to the loss caused by the climate change.\nImpact of Climate Change\nClimate change refers to the abnormal increase in temperature and the resulting changes in weather patterns. The extensive use of petroleum products, gas and coal, and the greenhouse gases produced from these, have caused significant changes in the climatic events. If the temperature continues to rise, the Earth will become even hotter, with dire consequences. For instance, this could lead to the melting of the Himalayan glaciers. Countries near the sea could face flooding. African nations could suffer from severe droughts and reduced or failed crop yields could lead to food shortages. Overall, studies have shown that this could bring a crisis to the global economy. Experts have been echoing these concerns.\nIf we look at the fact, the current temperature has already increased by 1.1 degrees Celsius compared to the 19th century, and it is estimated to rise by three degrees by the end of this century. If this happens, the world will face significant challenges. A report published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in April 2022 indicated that there is a risk of 10 to 15 percent of marine species becoming extinct. Similarly, scientists warn that if we do not act against climate change, around five hundred species could become extinct by the end of this century.\nImpact in Nepal\nThere is no doubt that the devastating Melamchi flood occurred in 2021, which caused significant loss of agriculture, destroy properties and psychosocial impact to people, was an effect of climate change. Similarly, during the first week of October 2021, flooding during Dashain in western Nepal destroyed agricultural products, including nearly ready paddy crop, worth 12 billion Nepalese rupees. The unseasonal flood in Mustang and the disaster in the Kabeli River corridor were also consequences of climate change. Irregular rainfall patterns such as not having rain like before, rain not occurring at the right time, or very little rain, are also being viewed as effects of climate change.\nAs Nepal has very nominal emission of carbon, even almost nil, the country is not responsible for climate change and its impact to the planet, but our environment has been severely impacted by the activity of rich nations, particularly wealthy and developed ones. The significant changes in regular climate patterns and their serious effects have become prominent issues across the world and us too. Therefore, we must act now and there is a vital role all government can play, in particular the role of local government is also crucial. The local government should not delay in identifying and adopting measures to mitigate the impacts of climate change in their areas adapting various programme on adaptation. Since local governments are the closest to the people and are directly involved in addressing their concerns, they have the power to make a substantial contribution to solving climate change issues and its impact on people.\nSo, what should be done?\nFirst, each local government should assess the impacts of climate change within its geography. This assessment should be conducted under the leadership of the local government and coordinated with civil society organizations involving experts, citizens, and various stakeholders in an active and meaningful manner. After the assessment, climate change programmes should be designed to contribute to provincial and federal indicators, as well as national and international goals and objectives. Programmes developed through such a participatory process should be included in the policies and programmes of the local government. To further expand these efforts, short-term and long-term plans should be formulated and budget allocations should be made accordingly. Raising awareness at community and making citizen aware about the consequences of climate crisis and adaption and mitigation plan that would start a step against the crisis. The political parties should also take initiative to make the local government accountable.\nThis is particularly important because almost all political parties have promised in some form, through their election declaration and manifesto to combat against the climate change. Some of these points are merely for show and are not included in the budget or policy programmes. Therefore, it is essential to demonstrate high morale and aspirations by developing and implementing inclusive programmes to address climate change. There should be specific plans to combat climate change, with proper budget allocation and effective implementation plan having a monitoring objective. All laws and plans should consider climate change and create adaptation plans accordingly. This will be a significant start for local governments.\nIn the current seven-stage planning process of local development, the climate change agenda should be integrated and included at all levels from community to municipal levels. It is important to inform the public about the initiatives that need to be taken by local governments regarding this issue. When allocating the budget, this issue should not be treated as secondary or neglected, it must be ensured that the allocated funds are spent specifically on this agenda and reported publicly.\nHow Serious are the local government representatives?\nElected representatives and bureaucrats tend to focus mainly on large infrastructure and physical development projects often neglecting the issue of climate change at the local level. There have been no initiatives to make the plans implemented by local governments environmentally and climate friendly. Even though there are possibilities to integrate and consolidate certain projects and programmes, this is not being done. If we do not become serious about this issue, we will not be able to claim that we have done justice to the entire society and future generations. Of course, to the planet.\nThis question cannot be addressed solely by the efforts of a single mayor, village chief, deputy mayor, or ward chairperson. Even if the problem is shared, it is only through the participation of the majority and common stakeholders, along with citizen engagement, that effective and beneficial results can be achieved. The more citizens involved, the greater the potential for success, although it may require significant dedication from them. Therefore, prior preparation and risk assessment are essential, and listening to the voices of the public is extremely crucial. Relevant and concentrated laws and processes need to be put in place for this purpose, and a citizen assembly could be a significant step forward.\nAdaptation Plans for Climate Change through Citizen Assemblies\nIn the context of climate change, the primary task, which must precede all others, is dialogue with citizens. For initiating such a dialogue effectively, the citizen assembly can be instrumental. Typically, such gatherings tend to attract a diverse group of individuals, but many vulnerable and marginalized families may not participate due to their daily struggles. Families and their members dependent on daily wage labor may not even consider participating in such assemblies. Hence, it is essential to adopt special measures through the citizen assembly process to include such individuals, incorporating their thoughts, experiences and opinions. Consequently, the viewpoints of individuals selected and elected through such assemblies, whether they are more inclined towards practical, realistic or ideological perspectives, can provide invaluable suggestions for addressing societal and climate-related challenges. Educating citizens about the subject matter through experts allows their knowledge and information to be refined and deepened. Doing this need assistance so that the ordinary people can also attend, and they are compensated against their time. This is to ensure they engage and have their say who are free from any -ism or vested interested.\nThrough presenting climate issues and discussing them extensively, primary solutions can be identified for implementation by municipal or village assemblies. This approach leads to the determination of more participatory and effective plans and programmes. When ordinary citizens embrace ownership of such issues and engage in result-oriented actions, there is no doubt that the pace of change accelerates.\nBut now, the ability of citizen assemblies to put an end to such behaviours where one's own interests are asserted by undermining others' existence or initiatives, or where individuals from different factions raise valid questions but face obstacles, reflects the prevailing situation the country has to deal with. Citizen assemblies have the capacity to limit such tendencies to a certain extent. Citizen's participation or the people from the bottom of the society will be the key to development. Regarding climate change, what needs to be understood at the local level requires everyone's involvement, even those who have not yet realized its significance. In some localities, this topic remains relatively new and requires further understanding.\nAct before it's too late.\nWe are the first generation to experience the impact and effects of climate change. If we do not take steps to mitigate its effects, it is likely that human existence itself will be at risk. Although the responsibility to address this lies in our hands, how much we suffer and how much future generations will suffer from the effects of climate change is now the key concern. This Earth is not just ours; it belongs to many others. Therefore, let's think about it today, let's do something. This Earth is not only ours, but it belongs to many others as well.\n(Shreeram KC is Communications professional in development and humanitarian sector, can be reached at [email protected])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"\nA few years ago, climate change was considered a topic of conversation only for the so called elite and educated circles.

Deputy Speaker Rana, who was elected from the Rastriya Swatantra Party, had landed in controversy after it emerged that she in February last year had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role.After months of heated debate, the ruling parties now argue that Deputy Speaker Rana’s conduct does not meet the standards outlined in Article 91 of the Constitution of Nepal, and want her out.A meeting of the senior party leaders of the Nepali Congress on Wednesday concluded that Rana had misused her post by writing directly to the US embassy.“That is why we call on the Deputy Speaker to resign, otherwise we will initiate the process to remove her,” said party’s chief whip Shyam Ghimire, adding, “She made a blunder by writing to the Embassy in such a manner.” “The process could take some days—possibly another two or three days,” said Ghimire. On February 26 last year, Rana wrote a letter to the US Embassy requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. She has been facing pressure to step down after the letter was leaked two months ago. In the letter, Rana requested the embassy to expedite interview dates for six people, including herself. The others named in the letter were Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar, and Dhan Prasad Gurung.Rana had written that she wanted the interview dates to be rescheduled to an earlier date as they were attending the 67th Commission on the Status of Women session, scheduled in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023.The RSP leaders have also admitted that Rana misused her position by directly writing to the US Embassy, but argue that the ruling alliance has blown the issue out of proportion after 19 months.The RSP and some fringe parties claim that the ruling parties want to have someone from the Nepali Congress as Deputy Speaker so that the alliance has an upper hand or absolute majority in the powerful Constitutional Council, which elects the chiefs and members of constitutional bodies including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.The Congress, despite being the largest party in the House of Representatives, does not have representation in the Council. Both the Congress and the UML have already gathered the necessary signatures to remove Rana if she refuses to step down. Although the UML remains unified on the issue, that is however not the case in the Congress. A Congress faction led by Shekhar Koirala has expressed dissatisfaction with the plan to remove Rana. Three Congress lawmakers—Shekhar Koirala, Sanjay Gautam, and Dig Bahadur Limbu—have yet to give their signatures to oust Rana, expressing concerns over the decision.“What’s the reasoning and justification for removing her now?” Limbu told The Post. “We’re not against the removal, but we need a solid, convincing explanation. First, we want to understand the real reason behind her possible removal. Second, it should be thoroughly discussed in the party. Third, we don’t want a repeat of the hasty impeachment of outgoing Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana,” Limbu added.The UML-Congress coalition is now preparing to register a motion against Rana in the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, sources say Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML chief Prime Minister Oli are working to convince Koirala, the Congress dissident leader, on their plan.If Rana is removed, the post of Deputy Speaker is expected to go to the Congress, lending credibility to the claims of the RSP and other fringe parties.Koirala’s faction is reportedly negotiating over the post. “Which is why the three lawmakers have not signed off yet,” a lawmaker close to Deuba told the Post. “If the post is given to the Koirala faction, they will agree within minutes,” the lawmaker added.Congress chief whip Ghimire claims that Koirala does not have strong objections to the plan to remove the Deputy Speaker.Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, who is from the Koirala camp, approved of removing Rana during Wednesday’s meeting of the current and former office bearers of the party.But some parties within the ruling coalition, including the Rastriya Janamat Party, have expressed their dissatisfaction.“There seems to be bad intent in the efforts to remove the Deputy Speaker,” said Raut in an interview given to the News Agency Nepal, a private news outlet, on Wednesday. “The ruling parties want to have a majority in the Constitutional Council.”The council, headed by the prime minister, includes the Chief Justice, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the chair of the National Assembly, the leader of the main opposition in the House of Representatives, and the Deputy Speaker.Currently, the UML, which leads the coalition government with the Congress and some fringe parties, holds two seats in the Council—Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and House Speaker Devraj Ghimire (who mandatorily stepped down from party positions upon appointment). The CPN (Maoist Centre) also has two seats, with the Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the opposition leader, and National Assembly chair Narayan Prasad Dahal, as its members.As members of the five-member Constitutional Council, the leader of the main opposition (Maoist Centre chief Dahal), the chairman of the National Assembly (Narayan Prasad Dahal, who is from Dahal’s party) and the Deputy Speaker Rana make it difficult for the prime minister to take majority-based decisions.Meanwhile, Rabi Lamichanne, the RSP chairman, on Wednesday met Prime Minister Oli and warned him not to make the mistake of removing Rana. The Maoist Centre, likewise, has openly come out in support of Rana.“We are not saying she is totally blameless or that she hasn’t made any mistakes. But why are the UML and the Congress acting now, after 19 months?” said Manish Jha, acting spokesperson of the RSP. “The RSP is open to investigating all cases. But there is no uniformity even in the ruling coalition on the decision to remove Rana,” said Jha.The ruling parties command a two-thirds parliamentary majority, which is needed to remove the Deputy Speaker. In the 275-strong House of Representatives, ruling parties need the support of 184 lawmakers. The Congress (88 seats), the UML (77 excluding the Speaker), the Janata Samajbadi Party (7), the Janamat Party (6), the Loktantrik Samjbadi Party (4), and the Nagarik Unmukti Party (4) together have 186 lawmakers—which is more than enough to secure the two-thirds majority.“There is no problem in garnering a two-third support needed to remove her,” said a Congress leader. “The reason CK Raut is opposing the bid is that Upendra Yadav is supporting Rana’s removal. Yadav and Raut are arch-rivals in Madhesi politics. The prime minister will speak to those who are unhappy with the decision,” the Congress leader said.“Since even the RSP has admitted that Rana has flouted the decorum and etiquette of her post, we have urged her to pave the way,” said Mahesh Bartuala, the chief whip of the UML. “Otherwise the law will take its natural course,” he told the Post.  ","summary":"A day after the ruling CPN-UML decided to press ahead with its plan to remove Deputy Speaker Indira Rana, another coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, threw its support behind the plan on Wednesday.The parties have accused Rana of misconduct.

However, it now lags behind its regional peers when it comes to the introduction of high-speed wireless internet technology.Six neighbouring countries—India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan—have already introduced the service. The Maldives was the first South Asian country to get 5G.The ‘Digital Nepal Framework 2019’ had taken a lead in 5G adoption in South Asia. But frequent government changes and geopolitical manoeuvrings pushed back the plan’s implementation.Nepal lifted its ban on the popular Chinese app TikTok but, insiders say, it has shown no urgency in rolling out 5G. The network’s trial has been contracted to Huawei, the Chinese company that helped Nepal launch 4G in 2017.The state-run telecom company says that the plan to roll out 5G, the high-speed wireless internet technology, may take months or even years as it has not yet had any commercial traffic.The exodus abroad of young Nepali people, who are avid users of the internet, has also worried service providers.The current generation of wireless internet is at least 10 times the speed of 4G and is even faster than most people get from their wired broadband connections at home.“We are not sure about the launch of 5G. It may take months or years to introduce 5G to the public as we are yet to conduct a commercial feasibility study,” said a top official at Nepal Telecom, who wished not to be named.“As introducing 5G requires huge investment. We must study the commercial aspect, too.”Officials estimate investment of around Rs50-60 billion to implement the technology.An initial report after the closed 5G trial shows that the new technology is technically feasible, but since 5G supportive devices are comparatively few, it would make no business sense.South Asia’s two smallest nations—Bhutan and the Maldives—have commercial 5G services. According to the report, in the Maldives, it is used only by overseas visitors with 5G phones as such devices were not available locally. The service was available in three regions only.5G is seen as a key enabler of Digital Drukyul, Bhutan’s five-year plan launched in 2018. The plan aims to “harness the power of ICT to transform Bhutan into a smart and inclusive society”.The state-owned Nepal Telecom had planned to start trials in July 2021, but following the regulatory approval for 5G testing in November 2021, it deferred the trial launch date to June 2022.The commercial services were planned for August 2022. Nepal Telecom now says it is conducting a commercial feasibility study of 5G.The telecom regulator has already said it is ready to allow 5G frequency and is waiting for service providers’ response.The Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulator, has said that service providers should clear all their government debts to take part in the auction.Talking to the Post on Tuesday, a highly placed source at the ministry said a high-ranking official from the International Telecommunication Union's South Asia region met with communication ministry officials and discussed a range of issues, including the 5G network.“Many things were discussed. The ITU official suggested looking into priority areas costs to introduce the fast technology and business from both public and commercial use before it is opened for public use,” the source added.While the state-owned telecom utility has been delaying the 5G launch, the private telecom service provider Ncell said it is “ready for 5G adoption”, though it may take some time as the equipment and network need to be readied accordingly.The government has not allowed Ncell to trial 5G despite its request.Recently, Ncell introduced Sadhain On data packages to prepare customers for 5G.“There are device constraints and few use cases currently, but once allowed, the company will introduce the suitable and appropriate service for its users,” according to Ncell.Telecom insiders say 4G’s expansion across the country has not been fully utilised. Therefore, a shift to 5G technology will take some time yet.According the report titled ‘Mobile network experience varies significantly across South Asia’ written by Hardik Khatri and published by Opensignal in November 2023, users in Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh spend between 12.4 percent to 14.8 percent of time connected to 3G networks, which drops to 5.8 percent in Sri Lanka. Users in India spend just 0.8 percent of their time connected to 3G. In Nepal, less than 9 percent of users rely exclusively on mobile data.Extensive reliance on older technologies such as 2G or 3G, which offer limited capabilities compared to 4G and 5G, is likely to result in an overall poorer user experience, the report said.Despite mountainous terrain and infrastructural challenges, time spent on wireless frequency (Wi-Fi) in Nepal is 52.9 percent, much greater than in other South Asian countries, the report said.The budget for the current fiscal year has a target to export goods and services worth Rs3 trillion in the information technology sector in the next ten years. This has the potential to create 500,000 direct and a million indirect jobs in the field.Through the budget, the government has announced that Nepal will be developed as an information technology hub and that artificial intelligence will be developed, promoted, and regulated accordingly.

But frequent government changes and geopolitical manoeuvrings pushed back the plan’s implementation.Nepal lifted its ban on the popular Chinese app TikTok but, insiders say, it has shown no urgency in rolling out 5G. The network’s trial has been contracted to Huawei, the Chinese company that helped Nepal launch 4G in 2017.The state-run telecom company says that the plan to roll out 5G, the high-speed wireless internet technology, may take months or even years as it has not yet had any commercial traffic.The exodus abroad of young Nepali people, who are avid users of the internet, has also worried service providers.The current generation of wireless internet is at least 10 times the speed of 4G and is even faster than most people get from their wired broadband connections at home.“We are not sure about the launch of 5G. It may take months or years to introduce 5G to the public as we are yet to conduct a commercial feasibility study,” said a top official at Nepal Telecom, who wished not to be named.“As introducing 5G requires huge investment. We must study the commercial aspect, too.”Officials estimate investment of around Rs50-60 billion to implement the technology.An initial report after the closed 5G trial shows that the new technology is technically feasible, but since 5G supportive devices are comparatively few, it would make no business sense.South Asia’s two smallest nations—Bhutan and the Maldives—have commercial 5G services. According to the report, in the Maldives, it is used only by overseas visitors with 5G phones as such devices were not available locally. The service was available in three regions only.5G is seen as a key enabler of Digital Drukyul, Bhutan’s five-year plan launched in 2018. The plan aims to “harness the power of ICT to transform Bhutan into a smart and inclusive society”.The state-owned Nepal Telecom had planned to start trials in July 2021, but following the regulatory approval for 5G testing in November 2021, it deferred the trial launch date to June 2022.The commercial services were planned for August 2022. Nepal Telecom now says it is conducting a commercial feasibility study of 5G.The telecom regulator has already said it is ready to allow 5G frequency and is waiting for service providers’ response.The Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulator, has said that service providers should clear all their government debts to take part in the auction.Talking to the Post on Tuesday, a highly placed source at the ministry said a high-ranking official from the International Telecommunication Union's South Asia region met with communication ministry officials and discussed a range of issues, including the 5G network.“Many things were discussed. The ITU official suggested looking into priority areas costs to introduce the fast technology and business from both public and commercial use before it is opened for public use,” the source added.While the state-owned telecom utility has been delaying the 5G launch, the private telecom service provider Ncell said it is “ready for 5G adoption”, though it may take some time as the equipment and network need to be readied accordingly.The government has not allowed Ncell to trial 5G despite its request.Recently, Ncell introduced Sadhain On data packages to prepare customers for 5G.“There are device constraints and few use cases currently, but once allowed, the company will introduce the suitable and appropriate service for its users,” according to Ncell.Telecom insiders say 4G’s expansion across the country has not been fully utilised. Therefore, a shift to 5G technology will take some time yet.According the report titled ‘Mobile network experience varies significantly across South Asia’ written by Hardik Khatri and published by Opensignal in November 2023, users in Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh spend between 12.4 percent to 14.8 percent of time connected to 3G networks, which drops to 5.8 percent in Sri Lanka. Users in India spend just 0.8 percent of their time connected to 3G. In Nepal, less than 9 percent of users rely exclusively on mobile data.Extensive reliance on older technologies such as 2G or 3G, which offer limited capabilities compared to 4G and 5G, is likely to result in an overall poorer user experience, the report said.Despite mountainous terrain and infrastructural challenges, time spent on wireless frequency (Wi-Fi) in Nepal is 52.9 percent, much greater than in other South Asian countries, the report said.The budget for the current fiscal year has a target to export goods and services worth Rs3 trillion in the information technology sector in the next ten years. This has the potential to create 500,000 direct and a million indirect jobs in the field.Through the budget, the government has announced that Nepal will be developed as an information technology hub and that artificial intelligence will be developed, promoted, and regulated accordingly.

Gharti admits that the learning/teaching has been hugely affected as the school administration is unable to find an English teacher.Dasharath Secondary School in ward 2 of Thantikandh Rural Municipality in Dailekh district had received a grant from the local unit for the appointment of science and math teachers last year. Despite announcing vacancies three times, the school has yet to find suitable candidates. While the federal government provided a math teacher for the current academic year, which began in mid-April, the school is still searching for a science teacher, said Amar Bahadur Shahi, headmaster at Dasharath Secondary School. According to him, the school has recently published another advertisement for the science teacher post.Teacher shortages are a widespread issue, affecting not just community schools in remote areas, but also educational institutions in more accessible regions. Jananamuna Secondary School in Birendranagar, headquarters of Karnali Province, established in 1952, stands out as a model school. It draws students from various backgrounds due to its strong academic results, exemplary extra-curricular activities and supportive learning environment. Yet, despite its reputation, the school has struggled to fill teaching positions for the past six months.The school published vacancy announcements three times in a local newspaper for basic level math and science teachers, but there have been no takers. “Birendranagar Municipality provided us a budget to hire three teachers. We managed to fill the Nepali teacher position after a second round of advertisement, but science and math teachers remain elusive,” said Govinda Koirala, chairman of the school management committee.The shortage of qualified subject teachers in community schools is a perennial problem across the country. Karnali, the country’s remotest province, is apparently the hardest hit by teacher shortage.“I visited Surkhet and Kathmandu several times in search of a teacher. I even went to some Tarai districts hoping to find a science teacher. We had to struggle for a year to appoint a science teacher,” said Umesh Bista, chairman of the school management committee of Naraharinath-based Mangalasaini Secondary School in Kalikot district.“It is quite difficult to find teachers, mainly for science and math. Even if we do find candidates, they refuse to serve in the rural areas of hill and mountain districts. This situation is likely to worsen. The government needs to address this issue promptly and develop appropriate plans and policies,” said Bista.There are a total of 2,983 community schools in Karnali Province. Many schools have a shortage of subject-specific teachers. Finding qualified science teachers for the secondary level is quite challenging. “Science graduates have various opportunities so they are often reluctant to pursue teaching careers. And they can earn significantly more by offering private tuition,” said Koirala, who is also the Karnali province coordinator of the community school management committee. As per the data available at education planning, data and research branch of Social Development Ministry of Karnali Province, there are a total of 626,010 students enrolled in community schools in the province. Of the 8,793 primary teacher positions, 644 are currently vacant. Similarly, 2,699 posts in lower secondary and 1,749 in secondary levels remain unfilled in the province.“There are some schools with either no teachers or no students. Some schools have too few teacher posts despite having many students, while others have more teachers than necessary. One major reason for the teacher shortage is the misalignment between teacher posts and the number of students,” said Balbir Sunar, section officer at the education planning, data and research branch. He recommends adjusting teacher posts to match the number of students at each school.  ","summary":"Araniko Technical Secondary School in ward 3 of Kaike Rural Municipality in Dolpa, a remote mountain district in Karnali Province, has yet to find a secondary-level English teacher, despite advertised the position twice.“We have been searching for an English teacher for the past four months,” said Govinda Gharti, the headmaster. “We managed to hire teachers for science and computer, but the English teacher position remains vacant.”Meanwhile, a basic-level teacher has been teaching English for secondary-level students due to the shortage of subject-specific teachers.

During Wednesday’s meeting, Speaker Ghimire clarified that the word ‘violence’ does not qualify to be termed unparliamentary based on the parliamentary regulations 2022, the discussions held during the meeting of the Business Advisory Committee of the lower house on September 3, and the opinion of the secretariat. Therefore, it would not be removed from the official record, he said.He also urged the lawmakers to be mindful of their language while addressing the House. “Figurative words used in speeches often spark debates. I urge everyone to be more careful in choosing their words,” Speaker Ghimire said.Speaking in the House after the Speaker’s announcement, Hit Raj Pandey, the Maoist Centre chief whip, said that since the Constitution of Nepal mentions people’s war, terming it “violence” was unconstitutional. “Should the language used in the Parliament be in line with the constitution?” he asked, saying the Speaker’s decision was biassed.Also addressing the House, Devendra Paudel, the Maoist Centre secretary, said labelling their people’s war as violence was intended to undermine the movement.However, UML lawmakers came in defence of Bhattarai’s statement and the Speaker’s decision. “The Comprehensive Peace Accord signed by the Maoists uses the word violence.

After days- or weeks-long agitation, successive governments have signed agreements with the representatives of the victims. For instance, last year, the then minister for Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation, Ranjita Shrestha, promised to resolve their problems and signed a seven-point agreement in the first week of August. The government failed to implement it. Then Balaram Adhikari replaced Shrestha at the ministry. The victims had to take to the streets again as the government failed to honour its commitment. Then, an Adhikari-led committee signed an eight-point agreement in March this year. This too was shelved.The authorities failed to make any progress even on the announcement made in the annual budget unveiled in May. The then finance minister Barsha Man Pun, while presenting the budget on May 28, had announced that the money of small depositors of up to Rs 500,000 would be returned. There was no progress on this front as well. Cheated by authorities multiple times, the cooperative victims yet again resumed their protest. This time, after a 108-day long protest, the authorities yet again signed an eight-point agreement with the victims on Monday. And yet again, things are not looking good for the victims. On Tuesday, a day after the ministry officials reached a new deal in Kathmandu and the victims became ready to halt their protests, the area outside the venue in Pokhara where a provincial meeting of the Rastriya Swatantra Party was to take place, turned tense. This happened after a group of cooperative victims showed black flags to party chief Rabi Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling millions of rupees from Pokhara-based Surya Darshan and other cooperatives. Former home minister Lamichhane vented his ire against the victims. He even went on to accuse the victims of being ‘mobilised’ at the behest of certain external elements. This was something unbecoming of the leader of the fourth largest force in the House—and of an ex-deputy prime minister at that. Lamichhane is one of the most high-profile individuals accused in the cooperative scam. A special parliamentary inquiry committee is investigating his involvement. The panel last month quizzed him continuously for around 10 hours. Though Lamichhane and his party have been claiming his innocence, several probes including those carried out by the House committee, police, local governments and other agencies point to his prominent role in the embezzlement of cooperative funds.Multiple studies and investigations have shown that the gravity of the cooperative crisis is unimaginable. The chair of the parliamentary special inquiry committee Surya Thapa says if the issue is not handled properly and promptly, the country’s entire financial sector could face a crisis. As of now, the House panel has found problems in around 500 cooperatives.We thus urge ‘high profile individuals’ linked to the scam not to incite the victims, who have already been cheated by cooperatives and subsequently by government authorities—multiple times. They seem to be running out of patience. The agitation by hundreds of thousands of angry victims of cooperatives may take a nasty turn at any time. At his volatile time, using disrespectful language against them would be like rubbing salt into their wounds. In the same spirit, we urge the parliamentary committee to quickly conclude the study and hand over the final report to the government. Prolonging this sordid saga is in no one’s interest, especially the victims who have clamoured for justice for so long.

Previously, India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives had established an annual trilateral defence dialogue. Seychelles and Mauritius were invited to attend the forum as observers. This trilateral defence dialogue was converted into the Colombo Security Conclave in November 2020, with Mauritius as a new member to establish close cooperation between the member countries having similar concerns. National Security Advisers of the four-member countries—Sri Lanka, India, the Maldives and Mauritius—attended the recent meeting, while Seychelles participated as an observer (it may join the group in the future). Bangladesh, which became the fifth member of the CSC in July 2024, did not participate. Apart from the CSC, other regional organisations focusing on the Indian Ocean are the Indian Ocean Rim Association and the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium. Minilaterals always help countries forge deeper ties. India has robust ties with these countries, making it easier to collaborate and cooperate on security matters and enhance capacity building among the members of this maritime grouping. Since 2021, the CSC has also held regular meetings at the Deputy National Security Adviser level. Five pillars of the CSCThe Colombo Security Conclave is based on five pillars of cooperation: Maritime Safety and Security; Countering Terrorism and Radicalisation; Combating Trafficking and Transnational Organised Crime; Cyber Security and Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Technology; and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief. Member countries also participate in the Coastal Security Conference held under the aegis of the CSC. Tabletop exercises (TTX), which are regularly conducted, promote interoperability among the participating countries’ armed forces.The CSC is a regional maritime security architecture based on common security challenges the member countries face. It builds maritime security capacities to respond to emergencies arising from natural calamities and deal with terrorism, piracy and other issues. The cooperation between some of these Indian Ocean littorals can be gauged because the Indian Ocean bears two-thirds of the world’s oil shipments, one-third of its bulk cargo and half of its container traffic. Over three-fourths of its traffic goes to other regions of the world, making it strategically important and a trade lifeline. The security conclave is the newest addition to the existing Indian Ocean Region multilateral forums and aims at close cooperation between the Indian Ocean countries on non-traditional security.Among these countries, India has historically close relations with its maritime neighbours in the Indian Ocean. For example, Mauritius appoints an Indian as its security adviser. Both Mauritius and Seychelles have an Indian Navy Officer as maritime security adviser. These appointments are highly significant for India as both are important partners in the Western Indian Ocean, where China also has a strong presence. The Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles and Sri Lanka are part of the Indian coastal radar network. Bangladesh was offered the installation of a coastal surveillance system in 2019. As all these countries are island nations, it will help them to monitor sub 20-meter fishing boats such as county boats, dinghies and fishing vessels in a heavy sea clutter environment in all weather conditions, thereby enhancing maritime security. Sri Lanka had witnessed how the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam used the sea to ferry arms into the country without being detected by Sri Lankan armed forces. India has established joint Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) surveillance with the Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles and has joint naval exercises with all the CSC countries. It has also provided some of these countries with an Indian-built patrol vessel to enhance their capacity to patrol their maritime coastline and EEZ.Emerging maritime architectureGiven the presence of several major powers in the Indian Ocean, building a regional security architecture on core issues of the Ocean littorals is important. India’s Security and Growth for All in the Region policy, announced in 2015, aims to strengthen ties with the Indian Ocean littorals as the region becomes a hotbed of great power competition. It ostensibly increases the presence of foreign navies to protect sea lines of communication and engage in anti-piracy operations. China’s naval expansion into the Ocean is to protect its trade and anti-piracy activities of its navy. This underlines why the trilateral defence dialogue was expanded, and the Colombo Security Conclave was formed to forge a common platform with countries where India already has robust defence cooperation, except for Bangladesh.Agreement on the five pillars identified by the CSC shows the countries’ priorities. Piracy and robbery have emerged as major threats. Recently, pirates attacked the Bangladeshi ship MV Abdullah, and its crews were taken hostage. The Indian naval warship and a long-range maritime patrol aircraft were pressed into locating the vessel. In February 2023, India and Seychelles inked an MoU to enhance maritime domain awareness, information sharing, anti-piracy operations, counter-terrorism exercises, training and capacity building. Similar bilateral cooperation mechanisms also exist between India and other member states. Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief have acquired significance after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.

From ancient philosophical discussions to modern social dynamics, it has been celebrated for developing trust and solidarity while also marked by periods of tension, betrayal and change. This balance of loyalty and self-interest makes friendship a relationship filled with both enduring strength and inherent fragility as it circumnavigates the highs and lows of personal and political life alike.In Nepali politics, friendship takes on a particularly complex and often cynical dimension. Political alliances are frequently formed and broken based on convenience and utility, with little or no regard for loyalty or genuine camaraderie. Much like Aristotle’s “friendship of utility”, these relationships dissolve when the mutual benefit ends. Interestingly, when party leaders come together, their followers and cadres also unite to form friendships and align themselves with the shifting dynamics at the top. However, when leaders grow distant or tensions arise, the same divide ripples down to the cadres and followers. This shows friendship’s strategic and transactional nature, where the bonds between party members and leaders are held together by temporary interests rather than a shared vision and commitment required for a long-term collaboration. The unification of the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) in 2018 to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) following the victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections is a telling example. This alliance was initially celebrated as a move towards political stability, but the partnership quickly weakened due to internal power struggles between KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Their friendship, born out of necessity and utility and undermined by deep-seated mistrust and conflicting interests between the leaders rather than genuine camaraderie, quickly disintegrated and collapsed in 2021. This episode validates Jacques Derrida’s scepticism about friendship’s purity and selfless bonds, as even ostensibly strong political bonds are fraught with power imbalances and inevitable betrayal.Similarly, the 2022 alliance between the traditionally adversarial Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-Maoist Centre further highlights this trend. Formed to counter the CPN-UML (and its coalitions) in the parliamentary elections, the alliance dissolved once the parties’ immediate political objectives were met. Such fragile alliances show how political convenience often precedes ideological consistency or long-term collaboration. As Aristotle discusses under “friendships of utility”, these fleeting friendships are not based on trust or understanding but opportunism. This practice of wheelchairing—constantly rotating allies—defines Nepali politics. The recent coalition government led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, formed in July 2024—the third change within two years since the parliament election held in 2022—is yet another example of how quickly political friendships shift based on immediate needs and the desire for power-sharing arrangements. This surprising partnership between the CPN-UML and the NC, once bitter rivals, has confounded many observers. Notably, from the day of this coalition, there have been rumours that it could be discontinued at any moment. People are as suspicious of this political friendship as Derrida was about the concept of friendship itself. It shows that what might appear as friendship on the surface is, in fact, an opportunistic manoeuvre—a reminder of Aristotle’s “friendship of utility”.The shifting alliances among Madheshi political parties further exemplify the fluidity of political friendship. These parties, representing the interests of the Madheshi people in the Terai region, have frequently realigned with larger national parties like the NC, UML, or CPN-Maoist, depending on the political climate. However, these alliances are often short-lived and based on immediate political gain rather than long-term commitments to shared goals or principles. The 2020 merger of the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal (RJPN) and the Federal Socialist Forum Nepal (FSFN) to form the Janata Samajwadi Party quickly led to internal disagreements and factionalism.The recent political history of Nepal shows no trace of Aristotle’s “friendship of virtue”, the highest and most enduring form built on mutual respect and admiration among Nepali political alliances. Nor will one find anything resembling Michel de Montaigne’s (a French Renaissance writer) notion of friendship, which transcends ordinary bonds and achieves a unity that defies explanation, as there is no room for the enduring trust and emotional connection he cherishes. The lack of more profound, virtuous friendships in Nepali politics reflects an unsettling reality: Political bonds are tenuous, driven by short-term gains and susceptible to collapse when the tides of power shift. There is only strategy, manoeuvring and the endless cycle of coalition and collapse. Derridean dictum “O my friends, there is no friend” summarises this sentiment because it underlines the gap between genuine camaraderie and the pragmatic, often self-serving nature of political bonds. At the same time, it urges us to reconsider what friendship means, not just in the political arena but in all spheres of life, where trust and loyalty are too often overshadowed by ambition and short-term goals.Baral is an assistant professor at Tribhuvan University and is currently pursuing PhD from the University of Texas at El Paso, United States.

This balance of loyalty and self-interest makes friendship a relationship filled with both enduring strength and inherent fragility as it circumnavigates the highs and lows of personal and political life alike.In Nepali politics, friendship takes on a particularly complex and often cynical dimension. Political alliances are frequently formed and broken based on convenience and utility, with little or no regard for loyalty or genuine camaraderie. Much like Aristotle’s “friendship of utility”, these relationships dissolve when the mutual benefit ends. Interestingly, when party leaders come together, their followers and cadres also unite to form friendships and align themselves with the shifting dynamics at the top. However, when leaders grow distant or tensions arise, the same divide ripples down to the cadres and followers. This shows friendship’s strategic and transactional nature, where the bonds between party members and leaders are held together by temporary interests rather than a shared vision and commitment required for a long-term collaboration. The unification of the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) in 2018 to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) following the victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections is a telling example. This alliance was initially celebrated as a move towards political stability, but the partnership quickly weakened due to internal power struggles between KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Their friendship, born out of necessity and utility and undermined by deep-seated mistrust and conflicting interests between the leaders rather than genuine camaraderie, quickly disintegrated and collapsed in 2021. This episode validates Jacques Derrida’s scepticism about friendship’s purity and selfless bonds, as even ostensibly strong political bonds are fraught with power imbalances and inevitable betrayal.Similarly, the 2022 alliance between the traditionally adversarial Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-Maoist Centre further highlights this trend. Formed to counter the CPN-UML (and its coalitions) in the parliamentary elections, the alliance dissolved once the parties’ immediate political objectives were met. Such fragile alliances show how political convenience often precedes ideological consistency or long-term collaboration. As Aristotle discusses under “friendships of utility”, these fleeting friendships are not based on trust or understanding but opportunism. This practice of wheelchairing—constantly rotating allies—defines Nepali politics. The recent coalition government led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, formed in July 2024—the third change within two years since the parliament election held in 2022—is yet another example of how quickly political friendships shift based on immediate needs and the desire for power-sharing arrangements. This surprising partnership between the CPN-UML and the NC, once bitter rivals, has confounded many observers. Notably, from the day of this coalition, there have been rumours that it could be discontinued at any moment. People are as suspicious of this political friendship as Derrida was about the concept of friendship itself. It shows that what might appear as friendship on the surface is, in fact, an opportunistic manoeuvre—a reminder of Aristotle’s “friendship of utility”.The shifting alliances among Madheshi political parties further exemplify the fluidity of political friendship. These parties, representing the interests of the Madheshi people in the Terai region, have frequently realigned with larger national parties like the NC, UML, or CPN-Maoist, depending on the political climate. However, these alliances are often short-lived and based on immediate political gain rather than long-term commitments to shared goals or principles. The 2020 merger of the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal (RJPN) and the Federal Socialist Forum Nepal (FSFN) to form the Janata Samajwadi Party quickly led to internal disagreements and factionalism.The recent political history of Nepal shows no trace of Aristotle’s “friendship of virtue”, the highest and most enduring form built on mutual respect and admiration among Nepali political alliances. Nor will one find anything resembling Michel de Montaigne’s (a French Renaissance writer) notion of friendship, which transcends ordinary bonds and achieves a unity that defies explanation, as there is no room for the enduring trust and emotional connection he cherishes. The lack of more profound, virtuous friendships in Nepali politics reflects an unsettling reality: Political bonds are tenuous, driven by short-term gains and susceptible to collapse when the tides of power shift. There is only strategy, manoeuvring and the endless cycle of coalition and collapse. Derridean dictum “O my friends, there is no friend” summarises this sentiment because it underlines the gap between genuine camaraderie and the pragmatic, often self-serving nature of political bonds. At the same time, it urges us to reconsider what friendship means, not just in the political arena but in all spheres of life, where trust and loyalty are too often overshadowed by ambition and short-term goals.Baral is an assistant professor at Tribhuvan University and is currently pursuing PhD from the University of Texas at El Paso, United States.

However, as in previous years, Nepali men didn’t want to leave them alone as they slid into their DMs and comment sections with hate speech and trolls criticising the women and body-shaming them. Such forms of online harassment aren’t seen only during festivals but are an everyday experience for many Nepali women. The internet has become an appendage of the physical reality where violence against women manifests in varied forms, including physical threats, sex trolling, zoom bombing, cyber flashing, revenge porn, etc. Moreover, it has become easier for the perpetrators to target many women at the same time using different online personas. This is evident in the data of the Cyber Bureau of Nepal, where 882 cyber crime cases against women were recorded in just the first two months of the fiscal year 2024-25. The past trends paint a worrying picture, as the bureau reported a total of 5,574 online harassment cases between 2016 and 2020. There were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women in the fiscal year 2022-23. The following year saw an approximate of 90.52 percent increase in cybercrime cases filed by women, for a total of 8,745 cases. With the advancement of digital technologies and the rise of AI content, women are being subjected to more forms of online abuse. A 2019 study revealed that 96 percent deepfake online videos were pornographic, highlighting how they are being used to demean women. In recent years, female journalists, celebrities and politicians have been repeatedly targeted online. The private lives of female politicians are endlessly scrutinised, and they face judgements online based on their intelligence and appearance. A report in 2021 showed that the Finnish female government ministers, including former Prime Minister Sanna Marin, were routinely criticised as the “lipstick government” or “Tampax team” on X. In our own country, this is apparent in the recent trolling of former Minister of Education, Science and Technology Sumana Shrestha and Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Sunita Dangol In Nepal, where per capita internet use is higher than in some developed countries but digital literacy is low, lack of cyber regulation creates a breeding ground for cyber violence. Section 47 of the Electronic Transaction Act, 2007 states that publishing material that harms public morality or decent behaviour could result in a fine of Rs 100,000 and up to five years of imprisonment. It doesn’t define what falls under these terms. Moreover, the Act doesn’t mention revenge porn or other forms of cyber abuse. We must have a strict legal framework as the platforms’ Community Standards and reporting systems on content removal can only do so much, especially in non-English languages where the bots can’t recognise local languages, slang and dialects. The issue has clearly not gotten the priority it should: a recent Post report revealed that the Cyber Bureau in Nepal is highly understaffed and underfunded, with only 26 of a desired staff level of 106 handling the IT department that solves cases. Cyber violence towards women underscores the bigger problem of misogyny ingrained in our societies. When misogynists see women taking up space and challenging traditional gender roles online, they police and shun them on the same platform. Without having a proper regulatory mechanism in place, technological advancement will only further help these moral police. It is time we took online violence against women seriously and stopped robbing them of their right to expression.  ","summary":"As Nepali women celebrated the festival of Teej last week and hosted dar parties in the days before, social media brimmed with videos of dressed-up women, finally relieved from their familial responsibilities, enjoying themselves to the fullest.

According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Health officials say this year’s death rate from the JE virus has exceeded 20 percent, and among the deceased, the number of children under 15 years of age is very high. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.The country started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organization officially issued prequalification certification, as the infection and death rates of the JE virus were very high then. In 2005, JE infections killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the districts of Tarai region. In the first phase, all populations of the highly-affected four districts, Banke, Bardia, Dang, and Kailali, were inoculated with the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into the routine immunisation list in 2015. However, data provided by the Health Ministry shows that only 50 percent of the infected patients were inoculated with the vaccine.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent infection. Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people still die and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.“Now is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, an expert on immunisation. “Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity from future infections. Authorities concerned must explore sources to finance vaccines and immunisation.”Health officials said they are aware of the deadly disease outbreak and have already started consulting aid agencies for help to finance the JE vaccination programme.“We have raised the issue with officials from the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation and requested their support,” said Lal. “We are also exploring other options to secure vaccine doses to help prevent future outbreaks.”Health officials said they have stepped up surveillance measures and requested help from other agencies concerned to break the chain of disease transmission. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal.

We walked to the terrace, basked under the sun, and chatted for an hour about his life and writing. During the talk, the eighty-one-year-old spoke passionately about literature and fondly looked back on his life. He sort of inspired me with the way he looked at things. “Take your work seriously, but don't take yourself seriously,” he said.After that, we stayed in touch through texts. One day, he told me he was coming to Kathmandu for the Kalinga Literary Festival. So I went to Hotel Himalaya in Lalitpur to chat about books and to receive a signed copy of his memoir, ‘Another Sort of Freedom’, as he had promised me. After navigating the crowd and shooing them away, I finally pulled Das into a corner and bombarded him with many questions. Known for his analysis of Indian society, economy, and history, Das is an Indian author, commentator, and former CEO of Procter & Gamble India. A graduate of Harvard University, he has also written plays and essays, blending his corporate experience with philosophy. Anish Ghimire of the Post sat down with Das to discuss his business life, how he stumbled into writing and books about the many puruṣārthas.What is writing to you? Well, it’s my whole life now. Sometimes, I dream I am completing a sentence, but it’s not coming out right, so I keep editing it. Then I wake up, and as early as six o’clock in the morning, I sit down to write for hours. When it’s going well, I forget myself. Hours go by like minutes. Is that what pulls you towards writing? The act of being in a bubble? A zone where you remain undisturbed? Yeah, that’s it. The thing is, if you love what you do, half the battle is over, and it can be anything, from a business executive to an actor. When people ask me about finding contentment, I always tell them two things: love your work and the person you live with. In my memoir, I talk about a chap named Kamble who worked as a night security guard for our company. He loved his job so much that he kept getting promoted. As for me, I stumbled into being a writer. I didn't want to become an academician and found the business world less satisfying. While working as a business executive, I wore a business hat Monday through Friday and a writing hat on the weekends. It's been thirty years, and I haven't taken off the writing hat. At what point in your business life did you realise that writing was an escape from everything? Well, I wouldn't call it an escape. I studied philosophy and Sanskrit at Harvard, and when I began working, I was thrown into the Indian Bazaars selling Vicks Vaporub. At one point, I got tired of it, and I missed the intellectual life. My mother talked about making a living, but my father talked about making a life. So, I was making a living Monday to Friday and on weekends, I was making a life. But Kamble made his life seven days a week. You studied philosophy and Sanskrit at Harvard University. How did you go from there to being a business executive? That was an accident. After Harvard, I got a scholarship from Oxford to continue my studies. That is when I asked myself, did I want to spend the rest of my life in that stratosphere of abstract thought? I wanted a life of action. Now, what is a life of action? Two hundred years ago, a life of action would mean becoming a warrior or a farmer. But today, we live in a commercial age, and the life of action is business. I also couldn't face the embarrassment on my mum’s face when I sat at home as an unemployed philosophy major. So, I turned the newspaper pages and applied for a job at a company. The company later became Procter and Gamble. I worked with them for decades, and when I approached fifty, I realised there is more to life. So, I retired early and have been a writer for thirty years.You held a high position in a big company for a long time. You were obviously good at your job. But were you happy? I liked the rough and tumble of business life, but it gave me limited pleasure. So, it made sense to combine two hats (business and writing). When office work wasn't going well, I would plunge into my writing, and if I had writer’s block, I would dive into my work again. So it worked for me. But at some point, I decided to be a full-time writer. My part-time writing was doing well, giving me the confidence to pursue it full-time.Tell me about your favourite book.My favourite book is ‘Mahabharata’ because it is very ‘human’. The book has good people doing bad things and bad people doing good things. I prefer it over ‘Ramayana’ because the latter is perfect. The hero is perfect, the hero’s brother is perfect, the hero’s wife is perfect, and even the villain is perfect. Whereas ‘Mahabharata’ is shaded. I like it because of its depiction of actuality and complex human traits. Maybe that explains why my book ‘The Difficulty of Being Good’, about similar subjects, has sold the most copies out of my other books. In your recent writings, have you noticed a shift in the themes or ideas that engage your readers? Each of my books is different as I discuss the different types of puruṣārthas. There are four types; Dharma (righteousness, moral values), Artha (prosperity, economic values), Kama (pleasure, love, psychological values) and Moksha (liberation, spiritual values, self-actualisation).I have written about Artha, ‘India Unbound’, Dharma, ‘The Difficulty of Being Good’ and Kama, ‘The Riddle of Desire’. My latest book ‘Another Sort of Freedom’ is on Moksha. In this writing evolution, I have also learned to write lightly. Reading my memoir, you will see how I structure my sentences. I don't use ‘and’. I call that a killer. I try to connect sentences using commas. Using a few words to say more is what I call writing lightly. Your work often touches on the moral and philosophical aspects of Indian epics. Do you see these ancient texts as relevant in addressing modern-day ethical dilemmas?‘Difficulty of Being Good’ has sold over a quarter million copies because I brought the ‘Mahabharata’ into the 21st century and did not return to the fifth century. I have discussed how the moral dilemmas in the ‘Mahabharata’ affect our lives today. We can learn from the problems faced by Yudhisthira, Draupadi, and others. That was my writing, and it seems people agree with me.Gurcharan Das’s book recommendationsMadame BovaryAuthor: Gustave FlaubertPublisher: Revue de Paris Year: 1857Flaubert’s tale of a woman trapped by societal expectations and desires is a masterpiece of realism. The book explores the consequences of living beyond one's means.Anna KareninaAuthor: Leo TolstoyPublisher: The Russian MessengerYear: 1878The book shows love, infidelity, and the complexities of human emotions. Tolstoy writes about the turmoil and societal issues in the Russian aristocracy.War and PeaceAuthor: Leo TolstoyPublisher: The Russian MessengerYear: 1867This novel blends history, philosophy, and romance.

However, rising temperatures caused by global warming have made protecting endangered species, such as snow leopards, a big challenge.The country has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half. According to a 2017 study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DOHM), Nepal's average annual maximum temperature has risen by 0.056 degrees Celsius. The study shows most districts have witnessed increasing temperatures each year, with hill and mountain districts witnessing a faster rise compared to the Tarai districts.“Protecting livestock—mountain goats, horses, mules, and yaks—has become increasingly challenging for farmers in Mustang and other mountain districts, which have been hardest hit by the climate crisis,” said Lal Bahadur Gurung, an expert on snow leopards. ‘‘The rising temperatures have increased incidents of human-wildlife conflicts in mountainous regions, and livestock are getting killed by both common and snow leopards.”It is estimated that there are around 400 snow leopards in Nepal out of fewer than 4,000 worldwide. Experts say snow leopards sometimes raid livestock barns during heavy snowfalls when prey becomes scarce, especially as they age and become weak. During such raids, they kill dozens of animals at once. Also, rising temperatures due to climate change are driving common leopards to higher altitudes, further increasing the threat to livestock.Multiple stakeholders have set up mechanisms to protect endangered species like snow leopards by reducing human-wildlife conflicts. But affected livestock farmers complained that these efforts only add to their misery.“I got nothing from anyone—not from the insurance company, the local government, or any of the agencies involved in snow leopard conservation,” complained Santosh Pariyar, another resident from ward 2 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality who lost 27 mountain goats in a snow leopard attack. “The insurance company wanted photos of the snow leopard carrying off my goats, along with tags as proof. Local officials asked me to show where the dead goats were buried.”Many livestock farmers the Post spoke to voiced similar frustrations, saying the mechanisms meant to reduce human-wildlife conflicts are overly problematic and too mechanical, which is fuelling growing resentment towards snow leopards.“Who would not be angry when dozens of livestock are killed at once,” said Anil Adhikari, executive director of the Teka Samuha Nepal, a non-profit that runs a community-based snow leopard conservation project in six local units in Mustang.“Unless we make the mechanisms set up for lessening human-wildlife conflict more farmer-friendly and provide compensation on time, we cannot expect the intended results.”Adhikari claimed that retaliatory killings of snow leopards, which used to be a major challenge to conservation efforts, have declined thanks to years of awareness efforts. He also said that farmers' growing frustration with the authorities' lackadaisical approach to compensation is a lingering issue. “Getting compensation from insurance companies and other authorities concerned is too difficult,” said Niraj Thakali, a local from Jomsom, Mustang. “First of all, most herders cannot gather all the required proof—photos of the leopard attack, insurance tags, and so on. Second, the compensation amount is so small that selling the meat of the dead animals is often more profitable than filing an insurance claim. And even when you file a claim, it takes months to receive the payment.” Thakali, an activist involved in snow leopard conservation, said that he too lost three horses a few months ago, but chose not to file an insurance claim, as he knows it is not easy to complete all bureaucratic procedures.“There is a growing awareness among locals that we shouldn’t kill snow leopards, even if they prey on our livestock,” said Sabi Thakali, a local from Thini village in ward 5 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality in Mustang. “The authorities need to step up and provide compensation promptly, if they want us to continue protecting these animals.” ","summary":"Til Bahadur Pariyar, a resident of Marpha in ward 2 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality in the mountain district of Mustang, complained that snow leopards killed 60 of his mountain goats over the last three years.A few months ago, he lost three horses to a common leopard, which has been moving into the mountainous region lately due to the warming climate.“Earlier, we only had to guard our livestock against snow leopards, but now common leopards also kill our animals,” complained Pariyar. “Many livestock farmers have already abandoned the profession due to the growing threat from predators—snow leopards and common leopards.”Nepal is among the 12 countries that are home to snow leopards and has committed to protecting the species, its prey, and its habitats.

And even when you file a claim, it takes months to receive the payment.” Thakali, an activist involved in snow leopard conservation, said that he too lost three horses a few months ago, but chose not to file an insurance claim, as he knows it is not easy to complete all bureaucratic procedures.“There is a growing awareness among locals that we shouldn’t kill snow leopards, even if they prey on our livestock,” said Sabi Thakali, a local from Thini village in ward 5 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality in Mustang. “The authorities need to step up and provide compensation promptly, if they want us to continue protecting these animals.” "},{"hash":"7f6789f15c16ec801d10b6cc9ed61910e17883f0f9270bfcf6dbb27d7b0129bd","title":"nepal-has-enormous-biomass-potential-research-shows","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/09/01/nepal-has-enormous-biomass-potential-research-shows","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/money/SISDOLBANCHAREDANDALANDFILLSITE202307180041-1725152935.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1725148800000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"Nepal has huge waste potential for biomass, a resource that can significantly boost the economy if correctly managed and valorised, according to a new research paper. Harnessing waste biomass could cut the country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption, according to the paper entitled ‘Possibilities and challenges for converting waste biomass into fuel, feed, and fertiliser in Nepal’.Most of Nepal’s waste biomass is used conventionally, such as for kitchen fuel and animal feed, without proper valorisation. This is a pressing issue as open dumping and burning, particularly of municipal waste, is a common practice in Nepal, according to the paper, with detrimental effects on the overall ecosystem.“Our study estimates the potential of about 89 million tonnes of waste biomass annually in Nepal, mainly from the agriculture, municipal, livestock, fowl, and human sectors,” said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.“We have revealed the potential at the sub-national level in Nepal, highlighting its possibilities and challenges for converting the fuel, feed, and fertilisers,” said Kafle, who is currently pursuing PhD at Auburn University, US.The paper estimates that through the conversion of waste biomass, Nepal can produce about 1.7 to 5.0 million tonnes of pellet or briquette and biochar, 1.7 to 5.1 million tonnes of feed block, 129 to 387 million cubic metres of biogas, and 0.6 to 1.9 million tonnes of fertiliser.“These valuable products can have significant environmental and economic benefits,” the paper said.Waste biomass is generated from different sources, such as forestry residue, agriculture crop residue, municipal organic waste, and livestock waste. Improper management of such residue and waste negatively impacts overall biodiversity, a growing global concern. For example, the poor handling and management of municipal solid waste, mainly generated from the urban sector, pollutes the surroundings and impacts overall biodiversity, including human health. Its management is one of the significant challenges for the relevant authorities, as it needs resources.Municipal solid waste, comprising more than half of organic waste in developing countries, is being dumped and burned openly in Nepal.Similarly, open burning of crop residues, especially paddy straw, is practised in Nepal, resulting in air pollution. This practice is particularly prominent in the Tarai, where combined harvesters scatter straw across the fields, making collection impractical. Farmers often burn the straw as they find it economically unviable to collect and meet the next cropping season. Livestock manures generate methane during decomposition, contributing to global warming. However, anaerobic digestion technology could trap and utilise this gas as energy.Also, improper management of human waste—urine and faeces—pollutes soil and groundwater, affecting human health. Although the country has declared itself free from open defecation, dumping raw sewage and septic tank waste into rivers is common in Nepal. Due to the lack of proper conversion knowledge and technology and the unavailability of status data, the waste biomass is improperly managed or conventionally used in many developing countries. The conventional use of waste biomass is less efficient, hazardous to the environment, and does not generate economic growth. For example, using dry dung cake instead of biogas for cooking fuel is less efficient, degrades indoor air quality, and impacts human health. The lack of data generation, consumption, and availability hinders policymaking and planning for the biomass-based industry.Some houses also have toilets connected to biogas plants. In the fiscal year 2020-21 alone, about 3,975 biogas plants were installed in Nepal. This shows that waste biomass is utilised in modern ways, such as producing biogas. However, the majority is still untapped and is conventionally used or managed poorly.Proper utilisation of such waste biomass needs quantification at the subnational level, which will help develop innovative industries for sustainable development, such as by enhancing the local economy, creating jobs and increasing the share of renewable energy.The study’s findings are significant and show enormous waste potential in the Tarai, especially in Morang district of Koshi Province. Prof Sushil Adhikari, co-author of the study and professor at Auburn University, highlighted the opportunities for producing fuel, feed, and fertilisers from such waste biomass. “The pellets and briquettes produced from waste biomass could effectively replace coal in thermal power industries such as brick and cement. It can reduce the country’s carbon dioxide emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption.” He elaborated on the benefits of producing a densified total mixed ration using crop residue. “In Nepal, where mass transport systems are lacking, and transport costs are high, such densified feed blocks could be a game changer in feed industries.” Further, biogas from waste biomass could reduce the dependency on imported LPG fuel and produce nutrient-rich fertilisers as by-products.“The country lacks location-specific data on the potential and availability of waste biomass, which is important for planning waste-based industries,” said Prajal Pradhan, the co-author of the study and assistant professor at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. Pradhan highlighted lack of mass transport infrastructures and networks and the challenges due to the topography and terrain, which create difficulties in transporting raw materials and final products. “Uncertainty in investment and market, insufficient management regulations and policies, and poor intersectoral coordination are added problems. These challenges need to be addressed to promote waste biomass-based industries in Nepal,” said Pradhan.

But soon they met Prakash, or Paka, a shadow figure living in oblivion for over three decades in the valley after being lost from Kathmandu. He had only hazy memories of his family and home in Jhapa, and his real name—Kale Tamang. The Herne Katha team soon began tracing his footsteps back to Jhapa. Along the journey, Paka’s memories of his childhood, his family and his home came back alive in bits and pieces. Ultimately, he found his family back—in Jhapa, where his sisters lived, and in Bhojpur, where his parents and brothers had resettled. On the eighth day of its premiere, as “The Lost Years” had reached 8.7 million views on YouTube, Paka had risen as a folk hero and the Herne Katha team garnered accolades and criticisms aplenty. A curious mixture of his destiny and Herne Katha’s storytelling helped him find home. But long after Herne Katha stopped rolling, his story continues to unravel. From a story, he is slowly metamorphosing into a content as he is being pushed towards uncharted territories. The return from social media-fed stardom to reality is rather troublesome and tragic—as we have seen in the case of the young Sachin Pariyar. Known for his quirky humour and mediocre singing, Sachin became an overnight sensation. Soon, his broken family became a feed for content creators; his father, nicknamed Kaloute, became a celebrated villain; and the child was made to beg on the streets of Kathmandu. The estrangementAs Paka metamorphoses into a subject for content creators, he is quickly losing the plot of his story. As YouTubers seek newness in their content, Paka will be encouraged to fabricate his hardships and seek financial support—things he had hardly ever done before. In no time, having repeated the fabrications on camera umpteen times, he will learn to believe them, even become obsessed with them. Questions about the inconsistencies in his plotline will follow, and he will have to supplement fabrications with lies. In no time, Paka will have lost touch with his story. Unless another good samaritan jumps in to save Paka from the viral infection of social media-driven stardom, this is more or less his trajectory in the next few weeks. There are some tell-tale signs of Paka’s downfall already: His parents have already started crying in front of YouTubers; his brother has already started reciting stale chutkilas; local politicians have offered him land to build a home; provincial and federal government representatives have promised to help him; and the common public have begun garlanding him and offering him money. The man who had mastered the art of living in the mountains will soon be tutored in the art of lying in front of the camera. Negotiating the journey from innocence to experience is often more difficult than spending cold winter nights in the company of yaks and sheep. Finding home should never be accompanied by the loss of self, but that is what happens when the story loses its plot. The spectacleThe history of the media is a story of fabrications. Folklores and myths, poetry and prose, or stories and reels, all depend on some bit of fabrication by the media that bear them—oral, visual, or tactile. The heroes we celebrate or the villains we loathe have all come to us through some sort of fabrications by the media ecosystem. From cave paintings' exaggeration of Neanderthal life to ChatGPT's fabrication about the books this author has not written, media of all forms exist in the interstitial space between truth and falsity. No wonder that Bidhya Chapagain and her Herne Katha team were criticised for \"fabricating\" Paka's story of hardship. Rather than wait for over a year to sell his story, we are told, the makers should have yelled about it into the ears of the authorities—meaning the exploitative system—for punitive action. If nothing, they should have at least asked difficult questions to Paka's master who had kept him without pay for over three decades.In the normative sense of action-oriented journalism, the criticisms against Herne Katha are not unfounded. A deeper probing into what led to Paka's misery would certainly have led to greater accountability from his master and the systems that disallow people like him from finding their way home. But not every story that involves a camera, a voiceover and a character is journalism, much less investigative journalism. Though with backgrounds in journalism, the Herne Katha team, in identifying themselves as storytellers, have not, at least now, made any serious claim to being activist-journalists. Rather, their interest seems to be in bearing witness and telling a good story. Everybody loves a good story, no matter whether it is that of selling dreams or shedding tears. Unless they resort to sensationalism and journalistic grandstanding, a bit of melodrama narrating the bittersweet story of a man lost in the mountains for 30 years is no big deal. But Paka's story is quickly becoming a public spectacle, and there is a risk of him losing his very being.   ","summary":"A year and a half ago, Bidhya Chapagain and her team of Herne Katha (Seeing Stories) visited the distant Chum Valley in Gorkha District to follow the story of Phunjo Lama.

What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles. Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination.

Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination.

According to party insiders, a group of dissidents has intensified activities with a plan to split the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), and to return to the mother party–CPN-UML.The dissidents are reportedly in negotiations with top UML leaders after they were either not selected as candidates or were defeated in the election of office bearers and Politburo members of the Unified Socialist.“Though I am not fully aware of dissident leaders’ recent moves, several leaders are not satisfied with the party, especially after the election of the office bearers,” said Keshav Lal Shrestha, who fought for the position of deputy party chair and got defeated.“Electing the party office bearers was not the mandate of the delegates to the general convention,” Shrestha told the Post.“In the Unified Socialist, there were various groups based on their opinions. To strengthen the newly formed party, we had agreed to choose the leadership in consensus. However, when the top three leaders were selected unanimously, they later decided to hold the election of office bearers, against the convention’s mandate.” During the election, top leaders issued different lists asking party representatives to elect those candidates as office bearers, Shrestha said. “When the party's top leaders themselves are guided by factional motives and cannot unify party members, why would other leaders still want to continue as party members?”Even though Shrestha did not admit that he was considering quitting the Unified Socialist, he didn’t deny that some party leaders were considering the move.The party's general convention, held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 5, unanimously elected Madhav Nepal the chairman, Ghanashyam Bhusal general secretary, and Jhala Nath Khanal senior leader.After the general convention unanimously elected the chairman and general secretary, they had announced to pick office bearers in consensus. However, party insiders said leaders close to Nepal lobbied hard to hold an election for office bearers considering the party establishment’s strong hold on the party organisation.During the office bearers’ election on August 27, the Nepal-Bhusal camp contested some vital positions, and the Nepal camp leader won most of them.After being defeated as vice-chair, Ramkumari Jhakri, Ramchandra Jha, Keshav Lal Shrestha, and deputy general secretary candidates Amar Bahadur Thapa, Jeevanram Shrestha, and other leaders are allegedly considering rejoining their mother party, CPN-UML, according to a party insider. Jhakri, who played a vital role in establishing the Unified Socialist in 2021, has for the last couple of months been lobbying for the party’s merger with the CPN-UML.In an interview with the Post just ahead of the election, Jhakri acknowledged that the party should consider unification with the mother party, UML.However, Jhakri on Sunday said that despite some leaders’ grievances towards the party leadership, there are slim chances of the party being split as yet.“The way the party leaders are handling the party’s affairs has caused disenchantment within the organisation,” Jhakri told the Post. However, she denied that the dissident leaders were considering a break-up.“We are in regular touch with some of the dissident leaders of the party, as reported in the media, but they are not in a mood to split the party,” says Somnath Pandey, a party secretary. “The rumour of the party split spread mainly after three of the federal lawmakers of our party were not involved in the party’s election process,” Pandey told the Post. “But see no such possibility.”Prem Ale, Kishan Shrestha, and Dhan Bahadur Budha, three of the party's ten lawmakers, do not currently hold any of the party positions. When Shrestha and Budha were the party's central members, Ale did not renew his membership.Pandey claimed that Jhakri is one of the party leaders who has considered quitting. Jhakri said she had just arrived from Qatar after attending a function as a party leader, meaning that she was yet to get updates.If there are some grievances of leaders, the party will try to solve them, Pandey said.Jha, who is considered as a dissident leader, also denied that he was planning to quit the party. “I have some reservations over how the election of office bearers was conducted,” Jha told the Post. “The party's top leadership circulated lists of the leaders to be elected, which was a wrong practice. But I have my differences with the UML too, so there is no possibility of me rejoining the old party.”Jha said that since Ale, Shrestha, and Budha are directly elected lawmakers, they might have some issues with the party for not selecting them ministers when the party was in power. “Other leaders should have no issues.”Ashesh Ghimire, a Politburo member, dismissed the talk as rumour. “Yes, there certainly is gossip that some of our party leaders are considering rejoining the UML, but this won’t happen as outsiders expect,” Ghimire told the Post. “It has been reported that some of our party leaders also met with UML chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli but this is unsubstantiated.” However, party insiders also claimed that in his meeting with some Unified Socialist leaders, Prime Minister Oli reportedly said that the government, before Dashain, will introduce an ordinance related to the political parties, making it easier for the dissidents to split the Unified Socialist. Ramsaran Bajgain, press coordinator for Prime Minister Oli, however, rubbished the claim. “The government is not considering issuing any ordinance to split a party at the moment,” Bajgain told the Post. Splitting a party currently has legal ambiguities. The Political Parties Act states that a group of party dissidents can split the organisation and form a new party if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members as well as at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.In August 2021, the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government issued the ordinance and changed the provision, enabling 20 percent of the central committee and 20 percent of lawmakers to form a new party. The law was then tweaked to help then-UML leader Madhav Nepal and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal’s Mahantha Thakur launch their parties. However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, immediately after the two parties split. After that, the government did not replace the ordinance, causing a legal void. Despite the legal ambiguities regarding the party's split, a group of leaders led by Ashok Rai of JSP-Nepal had split the party. With the support of six other lawmakers and 35 central committee members, Rai had split the party.Their party’s legal status is still unclear as their move to split the party has been challenged in the Supreme Court and the case is still sub judice.

He urged the Maoist leadership to stop glorifying such violence and asked them to be part of national development.The verbal war between the leaders of Oli’s party and the Maoist Centre intensified after lawmaker and UML Secretary Yogesh Bhattarai said in Parliament that the decade-long war waged by the Maoists against the state was “unfortunate”. In the House session on August 28, Bhattarai repeatedly termed the Maoist insurgency “violence”.“If the Maoist war was great, why did they abandon it?” Oli said days later. “Why did they join the peace process? If people’s war was great then it should have been successful but it was not. Later the peaceful movement became successful.”In one speech in Parliament, former prime minister Dahal warned that the fate of Nepali leaders could be similar to those of the ruling party leaders in Bangladesh as the recent incidents show and in Sri Lanka two years ago. Dahal went on to say that if the governing alliance of the Nepali Congress and the UML fails to address public aspirations, Nepal could face situations like in the two other South Asian nations.“You, not me, should learn from a lesson from Bangladesh,” Oli said, responding to Dahal, at an event on August 31. “Just yesterday, Prachanda ji [Dahal] reportedly advised me to learn lessons from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. But have I killed 17,000 people so I would tremble with fear? Have I robbed the people?”Oli continued, “I do not need to fear anyone. It is Dahal who must learn from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.”Oli also ruled out the possibility of Nepal becoming the next Sri Lanka or Bangladesh as Nepal’s history and tradition are different from those of the South Asian neighbours.At a function organised in Tundikhel on August 26 to mark Gaura Parva, some youths chanted slogans against Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. That caused worries among Nepali leaders and analysts that growing frustration among the Nepali youths could lead to a political disaster in Nepal.The growing rift between the UML and the Maoist Centre has been discussed in both the parties. The two communist forces formed an alliance ahead of the parliamentary elections in 2017. The next year, they merged to become the largest party and governed the country for three years.But the unity between the UML and the Maoist Centre did not last long. A Supreme Court verdict split them in May 2021, ruling that the unified party’s name was illegal.Even after the 2022 elections, Oli and Dahal teamed up twice to run the government but their coalitions were not successful.“After our decision to contest the elections independently, Maoist comrades seem to have become more aggressive towards us,” a senior UML leader said. “Without our or the Nepali Congress’s support, the Maoist Centre is unlikely to retain the national party status after the next elections.” A recent politburo meeting of the UML concluded that the possibility of unity or alliance among leftist parties had been over. On the other hand, the Congress, which joined forces with the Maoist Centre and other parties during the last elections, has also decided to contest the elections single-handedly. “The decisions of the Nepali Congress and the UML to contest the elections on their own have come as big shocks for the Maoist Centre. So they are venting ire against us,” the UML leader said.Meanwhile, the Maoist Centre has issued a circular to its rank and file to be ready for street protests. The internal communication in the Maoist Centre has further irked the UML, which leads the government.Ram Karki, a Maoist Centre secretary, said the standoff between the UML and his party is likely to continue because there is anger among the Maoists against the UML for having unseated Dahal from power.“There is also a lack of commitment among the leaders on both sides, and a huge trust deficit,” said Karki. “The Maoist leadership has become paranoid after Nepali Congress decided not to forge an alliance for the next election.”He also blamed a lack of political culture and maturity among the communist leaders for the animosity.In his speech to Parliament on August 27, Dahal called the Oli-led government “corrupt and regressive”. Dahal’s fiery rhetoric has created ripples in the UML. Another cause of misunderstanding between the two parties is talk of constitution amendment, which the Congress and the UML agreed to before forming the coalition. Besides, some UML leaders including party general secretary Shankar Pokhrel advocate a two-party system, arguing that it is necessary for the country’s stability and development.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” ","summary":"The rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers.

The price of the major kitchen staple has increased due to the rise in India, Nepal’s key source market.According to Indian media reports, onion prices have risen to over IRs70 per kg in retail in Delhi and IRs80 per kg in other regions.With retail onion prices now hovering over 47 percent higher than a year ago, India’s Union Food Minister Pralhad Joshi flagged off vans of two government cooperatives—the National Cooperative Consumer’s Federation (NCCF) and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation—to sell onions at IRs35 per kg.The Indian central government typically steps in when prices of onions, a politically sensitive commodity, start to climb. Every year, in the latter part of the monsoon, the onion crop gets damaged in key producing areas, leading to scarcity and price rises.The price increase in India has a direct impact on Nepal, which is heavily dependent on onion imports from its southern neighbour.Onions are cultivated three times a year in India—in monsoon, winter and summer.According to the comparative price index of the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the wholesale price of onion has increased by 20.32 percent within a month and by 71.29 percent within a year.On Monday, the wholesale price of onion in the Kalimati market was Rs128 per kg, compared to around Rs70 per kg a year ago.In retail, it costs Rs170 to Rs180 per kg.“The price has increased in India, which automatically affects the price in the Nepali market,” said Mohan Baniya, president of the Potato-Onion Import-Export and Wholesaler Association. “The price will start to cool down once the new harvest starts arriving in the Nepali market,” he said, adding that it would take a month for the new harvest to come in. “Until then, the wholesale price will hover around Rs130 per kg.” Traders say that in retail, onion may reach Rs200 per kg due to customs duties and other taxes.“In India, onions cost around Rs65 per kg, and after adding Rs45 customs duty, it costs Rs110, excluding transportation,” said Baniya.For consumers, price hikes on essential commodities, especially when the festival is around the corner, are a major concern.“Without onion, it is impossible to prepare many dishes,” said Banshi Acharya, a resident of Ravi Bhawan, who was buying vegetables in the Kalimati market on Saturday.“The price of daily essentials increases even with mere rumours. This shows a failure in the government’s ability to control market malpractices.”Onion arrivals in the Kalimati market have declined by 31.77 percent within a month. The market received 24 tonnes of onion on Friday.Onion imports declined by 68.14 percent in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July, compared to the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 51,544 tonnes of onions worth Rs2.15 billion in the last fiscal year.The Indian government banned onion exports in December last year and lifted the ban in May. However, India imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne, which caused a price hike in onions.Despite the five-month ban, the supply of onions in the Nepali vegetable market remained stable as onions continued to arrive through informal channels, traders say. “Despite the ban, prices stayed stable due to rampant smuggling.”In the last fiscal year, after the government imposed a 13 percent VAT on vegetables, including onions and potatoes, there were substantial price differences for onions in Nepal and India, which fuelled informal cross-border trade of onions, according to several reports. Nepal Police seized thousands of tonnes of onion smuggled in through the southern border, the reports say.Prices, eventually, started to cool down as smuggling surged.Even though Nepali customs officials regularly inspect the border, onions continued to be smuggled, particularly on motorbikes.According to research titled ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west.“India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher,” the research says.

The case-fatality rate among those infected can be as high as 30 percent. Permanent neurologic, cognitive, and behavioural sequelae occur in 30 to 50 percent of those with encephalitis, according to the UN health body.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so they provide only symptomatic treatment. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent the JE infection. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people die and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.The Health Directorate of Sudurpaschim Province, reported that two patients—a nine-year-old boy from ward 5 and a 60-year-old man from ward 6 of Ghodaghodi Municipality of the district—died from the infection.“The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out serological tests, confirmed the virus in both deceased and infected patients,” Dr Khagendra Bam, acting director of the directorate, told the Post over the phone from Doti. “Four others receiving treatment at hospitals are from adjoining Gauriganga Municipality, and their conditions are stable.”Officials say they are currently collecting data on under-five children to administer the vaccine. However, officials at the Health Ministry said that there are no immediate plans for additional vaccination drives in the disease-hit areas.“Deaths and infections from JE are reported every year, as the disease is endemic in our country,” said Gautam. “But the number of deaths and infections has significantly decreased compared to the past.”Officials said that in the past, dozens of people would die, and around 600 would be infected by the JE virus each year. Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.

He then pledged to raise the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 soon.But neither have the long waiting lines at the state-run health facilities ended, nor have serious discussions been held yet to increase government health insurance coverage.And now, the Ministry of Health and Population has issued a circular to all agencies concerned to implement the cabinet decision of running outpatient care on public holidays.Multiple experts the Post talked to, including doctors, retired bureaucrats, and representatives of the Nepal Medical Association, said that it is easier said than done and suggested that Health Minister Paudel should consult with experts before making any decision.“Many state-run hospitals have not even been able to run extended services,” said Dr Senendra Upreti, the former health secretary. “Decisions to end waiting lists at state-run hospitals, increase coverage of the health insurance scheme and run patient care on public holidays sound too good, but one should also know about the challenges of implementing those decisions. Long waiting lists at the hospitals should have ended as of now if it was so easy to do.”Most health ministers visit state-run hospitals upon assuming office and direct officials concerned to end the long waiting lists, commit to increasing human resources, and provide a required budget to ease patients’ suffering.Doctors say people have not expected the repetition of the same commitments from the new minister, from whom they have expected some changes.“Why would one serve on public holidays without any incentive, and how could the government force only health workers to serve on public holidays, not other civil servants?” questioned Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, a retired chief specialist at the Health Ministry. “I didn’t find other countries providing outpatient care on public holidays.”Upreti, who also served as chairman of the Health Insurance Board, said the minister's commitment to increase the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 shortly shows his ignorance about the ground reality. The government pays a premium of over 50 percent of those enrolled in the scheme and has to allocate additional billions of rupees to reimburse the hospitals. Due to the government’s inability to reimburse hospitals on time, many hospitals threaten to stop providing the scheme every year.Public health experts say the government has not increased human resources in state-run hospitals in the last 30 years. Despite that, the number of patients seeking health care has increased manifold, and the capacity and budget of health facilities have not increased accordingly. They said that all staffers are needed to run health facilities on public holidays, and the government has not allocated an additional budget to run health facilities on public holidays.“I have suggested the new health minister to start from small things,” said Shrestha. “He might have thought that ending long waiting lists in state-run hospitals is trivial, but it is not so trivial. I have also asked him to hold staffers of the Health Ministry until office hours first.”Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Association, the umbrella organisation of medical doctors, has protested against the decision to run outpatient departments on public holidays.Issuing a statement on Tuesday, the association sought the government’s attention to the lack of human resources in the state-run health facilities.“No new post has been created in the last 33 years,” said Dr Anil Bikram Karki, chairman of the association. “Doctors have already been working 72 hours a week despite not being incentivised to work during the Covid-19 pandemic. We have strong reservations against the decision to run outpatient care on public holidays without offering incentives to health workers and increasing the human resources.”Doctors say the long waiting lines in state-run health facilities will end if the government creates additional posts for health workers, including doctors, and makes the referral mechanism systematic.They said patients should not be forced to visit Kathmandu to examine minor health problems. Instead, health workers and services should be made available in the local health facilities, human resources should be increased, and more budget should be allocated.“If we have problems with long waiting lines in hospitals, citizens have to endure long queues while accessing public service,” said Karki. “Doctors never deny emergency services, but one should not mix emergency care with elective care [planned medical care].

It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure.

Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death.

Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death.

The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. ","summary":"In a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause.

So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees.

Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. ","summary":"We spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

He was aged 86.Close colleagues visited him earlier in the day, reporting that he was in a critical condition.\"After a long battle with cancer, our father... has just departed to meet the Lord,\" his daughter Keiko Fujimori wrote in a message on X, also signed by the former leader’s other children.Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, was the little-known chancellor of a farming university when elected to office in 1990.

Guzman died in prison in September 2021.But many Peruvians saw Fujimori as an autocrat after he used military tanks to shut down Congress in 1992, redrafting the constitution to his liking to push free-market reforms and tough anti-terrorism laws.A slew of corruption scandals during his 10-year administration also turned public opinion against him.Shortly after he won a third election in 2000 - amending the constitution to run - videos emerged of his top adviser and spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos doling out cash to bribe politicians.

So many were shocked when in 2005 he decided to head back to Peru, apparently in hopes of forgiveness and a return to politics.Instead, he was detained during a layover in Chile, extradited to Peru in 2007, and in 2009 he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.‘Fuji-shock’Once jailed, Fujimori’s public appearances were limited to hospital visits where he often appeared disheveled and unwell.While detractors dismissed his health complaints as a ploy to get out of prison, then-president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski briefly pardoned Fujimori in 2017.Months later Kuczynski was impeached and the pardon overturned by Peru’s top constitutional court, sending Fujimori back to the special prison that held him and no other inmates.The court restored the pardon in December 2023, releasing the ailing Fujimori, who had suffered from stomach ulcers, hypertension and tongue cancer. In May 2024, Fujimori announced he had been diagnosed with a malignant tumor.Fujimori’s legacy has been most passionately defended by his daughter Keiko, who has been close to clinching the presidency herself three times on a platform that has included pardoning her father and defending his constitution.Outside Fujimori’s residence on Wednesday evening supporters gathered to mourn and pray.\"Today, I weep for a leader,\" Fujimori backer Cesar Valverde said. \"He should have been president again; we were working for Alberto Fujimori to be president again, but God has taken him.\"Keiko had said in July that her father planned to run for the presidency again in the 2026 election.The late Fujimori was born in Lima on Peruvian Independence Day, July 28, 1938.A mathematician and agricultural engineer, Fujimori was a political nobody when he decided to run for the presidency, driving a tractor to his campaign rallies.

A public falling-out with his first wife Susana Higuchi while he was president led him to name daughter Keiko as the first lady. The couple had three other children, including Kenji Fujimori, also a politician. ","summary":"Former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori, who steered economic growth during the 1990s but was later jailed for human rights abuses stemming from a bloody war against Maoist rebels, died on Wednesday. He was aged 86.Close colleagues visited him earlier in the day, reporting that he was in a critical condition.\"After a long battle with cancer, our father... has just departed to meet the Lord,\" his daughter Keiko Fujimori wrote in a message on X, also signed by the former leader’s other children.Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, was the little-known chancellor of a farming university when elected to office in 1990. He quickly established himself as a cunning politician whose hands-on style produced results even as he angered critics for concentrating power.He slayed hyperinflation that had thrown millions of Peruvians out of work, privatized dozens of state-run companies and slashed trade tariffs, setting the foundations for Peru to become, for a while, one of Latin America’s most stable economies.Under his watch, the feared leader of the Maoist Shining Path, Abimael Guzman, was captured - dealing a crucial blow to a movement that in the 1980s seemed close to toppling the Peruvian state.

Some were former Russian soldiers, at least one of whom had retired after a full-length army career.Grisly footage of dead fighters has now circulated online, and some of relatives told Reuters the bodies of their husbands and sons had been abandoned in the desert. Reuters could not confirm how many of the men it identified were dead.Margarita Goncharova said her son, Vadim Evsiukov, 31, was first recruited in prisonwhere he was serving a drug-related sentence in 2022. He rose through the ranks in Ukraine to lead a platoon of 500 men, she said. After coming home, he worked as a tailor but struggled with survivor’s guilt and secretly travelled to Africa in April to join his former commander, she said.“He wanted to fly to Africa many times. I discouraged him as much as I could,” Goncharova said in an interview with Reuters. “I told him 'fate has given you a once-in-a-million chance. You can start your life again, you've won such a crazy lottery'.”The Russian Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Wagner did not respond to requests for comment for this story.After Prigozhin died in August last year, Wagner employees were invited to join a newly created group called the Africa Corps, under the defence ministry, “to fight for justice and the interests of Russia,” according to the Africa Corps channel on social-media platform Telegram.On the channel, Africa Corps says about half its personnel are former Wagner employees who it allows to use Wagner insignia. Wagner’s social media channels remain active.The Russian government has not publicly commented on the Tinzaouaten battle.Mali's armed forces-led government said the defeat had no impact on its goals. The Malian Armed Forces “are committed to restoring the authority of the state throughout the country,” army spokesman Colonel Major Souleymane Dembele told Reuters.Wagner has acknowledged heavy losses in the Mali ambush but gave no figure. The Malian army, which fought alongside the Russians, also did not give a toll. Tuareg rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland, said they had killed 84 Russians and 47 Malians.Reuters could not independently establish how many were killed in battle. One video, out of more than 20 sent to Reuters by a Tuareg rebel spokesman, showed at least 47 bodies, mostly white men, in military-style uniforms lying in the desert. Reuters verified the location and date of the video.Mikhail Zvinchuk, a prominent blogger close to the Russian defence ministry, said on social media platform RuTube in August that the defeat showed Wagner fighters who arrived from Ukraine had underestimated the rebels and the Al Qaeda fighters.MISSING IN ACTIONWagner-linked Telegram accounts named two of the dead as Nikita Fedyakin, the administrator of The Grey Zone, a popular Wagner-focused Telegram channel with over half a million subscribers, and Sergei Shevchenko, who the accounts described as the unit commander. Reuters could not verify the identity of Shevchenko.Reuters separately identified 23 Wagner operators missing in Mali via relatives who posted in an official Wagner Telegram chat group, checking the names against social media accounts, publicly available data and facial recognition software. All the relatives received calls from Wagner recruiters on Aug. 6 to notify them their men were missing in action, they said in the chat group.Lyubov Bazhenova told Reuters she had no idea her son Vladimir Akimov, 25, who had briefly served in Russia's elite airborne forces as a conscript, had signed up. She was angry with Wagner for sharing no further information about his fate or the whereabouts of his body. She said letters to the prosecutor's office, defence ministry and foreign ministry had gone unanswered.Facial-recognition software was used to identify another two men captured by Tuareg fighters, based on photographs and videos of the ambush site published by Tuareg sources. The Tuareg rebels posted videos and photos of the two captives on social media. Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, a spokesman for the rebel alliance, confirmed the men were in rebel captivity as of late August.One of the missing fighters, Alexei Kuzekmaev, 47, had no military experience, his wife Lyudmila Kuzekmaeva told Reuters.\"Neither my hysterics, nor tears, nor persuasion - nothing helped. He just confronted me a month before he left home. He said 'I bought a ticket and will be leaving.'\"Among the most experienced men was Alexander Lazarev, 48, a Russian army veteran who served in wars against Chechen separatists in the 1990s and 2000s, according to his wife's posts in the Wagner channel.She declined to comment. Lazarev appears in many photos on the Russian Facebook equivalent VKontakte wearing military uniform, with symbols linked to several army subdivisions.PARASTATAL MERCENARY FORCEDemocratic governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger were overthrown in a series of coups since 2020 driven by anger with corrupt leaders and a near decade of failed Western efforts to fight insurgencies that have killed thousands and displaced millions.The military juntas have kicked out French and U.S. troops and U.N. peacekeepers.In Africa, Wagner emerged in Sudan in 2017 as the deniable face of Russian operations. Its enterprises soon ranged from protecting African coup leaders to gold mining and fighting jihadists. Wagner is also active in Central African Republic. It first appeared in Mali in late 2021.Wagner's fortunes rose and fell last year. In May, the group led Russia to its first significant Ukrainian battlefield victory in almost a year with the capture of Bakhmut. But after his criticism of Russian military leaders and his effort to lead a rebellion weeks after the Bakhmut victory, Prigozhin died in a fiery plane crash in August. The Kremlin has rejected as an \"absolute lie\" U.S. officials' claim that Putin had Prigozhin killed.Eric Whitaker, the top U.S. envoy to Burkina Faso until retiring in June, who previously served in Niger, Mali and Chad, said the Putin administration has achieved complete control over the Wagner brand in the post-Prigozhin era.\"Africa Corps earns (the Russian government) hard-currency payments from host governments for its services and also gains a significant sources of revenue from gold derived from its activities in the Sahel,\" he said.Russian mercenary activity soared in Mali after Africa Corps was formed, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a U.S.-based crisis-monitoring group.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. ","summary":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

In a similar vein, conservationists and natural resource management professionals expect the management of forests and other resources to be more effective now, protecting the long-term interests of the country and its population.Previous regimes were more concerned about success stories in all sectors, with fabricated success carefully covering unattended challenges. Political interference was widespread in institutional decision-making, leading to wastage of public resources, ignorance of expert opinions, and forsaking of participation and stakeholder consultation. Against this backdrop, the Forest Department and other related agencies gradually drifted far from their due course.The interim government may weigh on several issues that I believe are crucial for transforming the public forest management system into a more transparent and accountable one.One such issue is data tampering and the misrepresentation of facts. It has been customary, over the past decade, to present exaggerated scenarios in terms of achievement. For instance, the data regarding national forest cover, which was shown to be around 12.6 percent, while it is in reality around 8.6 percent. These has immense bearing on our national forest coverage targets, and the targets against the relevant SDGs, policy, plans, and strategies, as the distorted data places us on an impractical trajectory.Therefore, the scholarly demand is to correct the course through updating Bangladesh's actual forest cover data, and reconsider various national targets accordingly.Most of the forest and relevant laws in practice are from the British regime, and devoid of any consideration of the people. Moreover, parts of the reserved forests are declared as Protected Areas to fulfil international obligations, which further limits accessibility and the rights of the people. It has never been a practice of the Forest Department to arrange public consultation while declaring public forests as Protected Areas. At present, 52 percent of the Sundarbans forest (including the waterways) has been declared as Protected Areas with harsher usage regulations. This often makes the lives of forest-dependent locals miserable, and ultimately results in exacerbated illegal practices.The rights of local communities should be ensured by revising the boundaries of declared Protected Areas and subsequent declarations. Alongside the Protected Areas management plan, a mandatory management requirement for each Protected Area should be prepared for real action to fill the missing gaps.Another area of concern is the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), an underutilised hidden gem for forest restoration and carbon conservation. Despite the widespread deforestation (522,158 hectares) and forest degradation (146,210 hectares) in the CHT region, efforts are not being taken to restore it at scale because of the conflicting land management responsibilities of the various departments. Some part of the CHT forest land is managed by the Forest Department, termed as reserved forests, while most of it is under the management of the deputy commissioners representing the land ministry, often termed as unclassified state forests. The latter has no mandate to prevent forest degradation or restoration; therefore, the lands are undergoing further degradation due to massive expansion of agriculture and horticultural crops. The Forest Department, on the other hand, has no functional ties or programmes under the administrative structures created in light of the 1997 CHT Accord.However, appropriate community-based forest conservation programmes could increase forest cover by eliminating conflicting land uses and create further opportunities to foster employment in the hills, generate timber and non-timber products, secure livelihoods and thus reduce landslide, soil erosion and siltation, improve watersheds, regulate local climate, and achieve both national REDD+ and Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets. Furthermore, it is possible to earn a considerable amount of foreign currencies from the voluntary or regulatory carbon markets through emission reduction by carbon conservation in the forests.Unfortunately in the forestry sector, we see exclusionary, vested interest-led and often politically biased, inefficient and even unnecessarily planned and implemented development programmes. Some salient examples include the installation of non-profitable and useless ropeway in the name of Sheikh Russel Aviary and Ecopark in Rangunia, the establishment of a safari park at Lathitila forest and numerous ecoparks.

From democratic socialists to moderate Leftists to Marxists and Bolsheviks to Bolivarans, all dream of establishing a classless society under a single-party dictatorship. Not being a socialist in this country is a political sacrilege and, ostensibly, becoming anti-development, if not outrightly anti-national. Nevertheless, almost all of these pipe dreamers have accepted the “mainstream” adult franchise-based parliamentary democracy.Not being socialist also (perhaps) goes against the Constitution. This is because, in at least three instances, The Constitution of Nepal 2015 categorically mentions the term “socialism” while defining the nature of the Nepali state. The preamble states that the constitution was issued as its formulator, the Constituent Assembly, was “committed to socialism”. Article 4(1) defines the State of Nepal as “an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive, democratic, socialism-oriented, federal democratic republican state”. Under the Directive Principles (Article 50, Clause 3), the objective of the State is “to develop a socialism-oriented independent and prosperous economy.” Tragically, the constitution has skipped the definition of the term “socialism”, making it a paradise for the interpretation of convenience.Political stunts often resurface to save socialism from falling from grace. When Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was prime minister, he formed a socialist front last January, including three other left parties—Janata Samajbadi Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Biplov). Now out of power, Dahal is trying to bring other fringe parties into the fold for a more organised opposition to the current government. There have been several efforts in history to unite the so-called socialists. But in practice, opportunism has homogenised Nepal’s every political outfit into a power-hungry brute force without principle, let alone ideology. The travesty, however, is that the fundamental allegation to demean one party by the other, mainly among the communist parties, is “the blatant abandonment of the principles of socialism.”Outdated narrativesSocialism takes refuge in utterly outdated socioeconomics and ecopolitical narratives for its survival. The overarching prescription is that the state must not only provide free health and education but also reduce the private sector’s role in the economy. The constitution includes free education up to the secondary level, free basic health care and gainful employment as fundamental rights. The socialists see all economic and political ills as the outcome of engulfing trends of liberalisation and globalisation. They still advocate for land reform that ensures entitlement of the “land to the tiller”. However, in reality, the younger generation is unwilling to own farms as they are moving away from agriculture to modern sectors of employment and entrepreneurship. Huge amounts of fertile land are increasingly being left uncultivated for want of people opting for farming. Besides, the unplanned drive of land fragmentation has converted entire farmlands into unfeasible patches for commercial-scale production of agricultural products. Failed land use planning and haphazard urbanisation have further eroded the prospects of the land used for agriculture.The pro-socialist crusade may not have appeared vocal to stop the privatisation of highly loss-making state-owned enterprises, stall private sector economic reforms and discontinue the centralised planning process, but they have crept into every aspect of economic policy-making. As a result, the economy is persistently left without a development model, and growth has stagnated beyond endurance. Nepal’s market integration with even the regional market is very limited, and the economy, seemingly irreversibly, becomes import-dependent, draining out capital and young brains.RamificationsThe discourse itself is anachronistic. The political parties are not competing to be forward-looking and pro-reform but to prove themselves purer socialists than others. This is rapidly disconnecting the political parties from the political system the country has adopted at a great opportunity cost and from the economic system that must generate output to increase public well-being.Philosophically, socialism with intended control of the state is the opposite pole to federalism, which seeks to devolve political and economic power closer to the masses. But most of Nepal’s political parties are playing devout socialists and ardent federalists. So, it is no surprise that federalism has been able to produce only suboptimal results during the last seven years of its implementation. The subnational political and administrative units created akin to the federal setup for all practical purposes remain subservient to the power concentrated at the centre. The concept of the controlling “central” government is finding it hard to convert into a coordinating “federal” government.The socialist idea of every facility being financed by the state certainly looks benign on the surface. This simply means the state treasury has to be adequately filled and continuously replenished to fulfil all existing public demands for services and facilities and be enough to meet future aspirations for improved quality of life. Without a reliable revenue source, the state can neither finance better public delivery nor develop infrastructure for the future. Nepal is now exactly in this trap.The real paradox of the socialist model of state-managed economy lies exactly here. Revenue on a convincing scale can only be generated if private sector investment substantially increases productivity, profit, employment and personal income. The state financing everything, even if it becomes a basic right included in the constitution, is impossible without making the market economy sizable, vibrant and capable of paying taxes. Such a market is impossible to imagine without unhindered private sector investment. Foreign investment is the new paradigm in the economies with comparative advantage. However, the very idea of a state-controlled socialist economy is perhaps enough to turn the heads of foreign investors away from the economy in question.Even Karl Marx’s Das Kapital advocated for the highest level of capital growth for extreme exploitation to explode into revolution. However, Nepali socialists didn't even recognise the importance of the inevitable expansion of capital for a state. The state apparatus has evolved since Marx to prevent extreme exploitation. Also, capitalists need not be exterminated by violence but can be constructively made liable to duly paying tax to the state.   ","summary":"Even in the era of the meteoric rise of ultra-right politics globally, Nepal is among a few countries whose politics is dominated by socialists of different shades. From democratic socialists to moderate Leftists to Marxists and Bolsheviks to Bolivarans, all dream of establishing a classless society under a single-party dictatorship. Not being a socialist in this country is a political sacrilege and, ostensibly, becoming anti-development, if not outrightly anti-national. Nevertheless, almost all of these pipe dreamers have accepted the “mainstream” adult franchise-based parliamentary democracy.Not being socialist also (perhaps) goes against the Constitution. This is because, in at least three instances, The Constitution of Nepal 2015 categorically mentions the term “socialism” while defining the nature of the Nepali state. The preamble states that the constitution was issued as its formulator, the Constituent Assembly, was “committed to socialism”. Article 4(1) defines the State of Nepal as “an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive, democratic, socialism-oriented, federal democratic republican state”. Under the Directive Principles (Article 50, Clause 3), the objective of the State is “to develop a socialism-oriented independent and prosperous economy.” Tragically, the constitution has skipped the definition of the term “socialism”, making it a paradise for the interpretation of convenience.Political stunts often resurface to save socialism from falling from grace. When Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was prime minister, he formed a socialist front last January, including three other left parties—Janata Samajbadi Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Biplov). Now out of power, Dahal is trying to bring other fringe parties into the fold for a more organised opposition to the current government. There have been several efforts in history to unite the so-called socialists. But in practice, opportunism has homogenised Nepal’s every political outfit into a power-hungry brute force without principle, let alone ideology. The travesty, however, is that the fundamental allegation to demean one party by the other, mainly among the communist parties, is “the blatant abandonment of the principles of socialism.”Outdated narrativesSocialism takes refuge in utterly outdated socioeconomics and ecopolitical narratives for its survival. The overarching prescription is that the state must not only provide free health and education but also reduce the private sector’s role in the economy. The constitution includes free education up to the secondary level, free basic health care and gainful employment as fundamental rights. The socialists see all economic and political ills as the outcome of engulfing trends of liberalisation and globalisation. They still advocate for land reform that ensures entitlement of the “land to the tiller”. However, in reality, the younger generation is unwilling to own farms as they are moving away from agriculture to modern sectors of employment and entrepreneurship. Huge amounts of fertile land are increasingly being left uncultivated for want of people opting for farming. Besides, the unplanned drive of land fragmentation has converted entire farmlands into unfeasible patches for commercial-scale production of agricultural products. Failed land use planning and haphazard urbanisation have further eroded the prospects of the land used for agriculture.The pro-socialist crusade may not have appeared vocal to stop the privatisation of highly loss-making state-owned enterprises, stall private sector economic reforms and discontinue the centralised planning process, but they have crept into every aspect of economic policy-making. As a result, the economy is persistently left without a development model, and growth has stagnated beyond endurance. Nepal’s market integration with even the regional market is very limited, and the economy, seemingly irreversibly, becomes import-dependent, draining out capital and young brains.RamificationsThe discourse itself is anachronistic. The political parties are not competing to be forward-looking and pro-reform but to prove themselves purer socialists than others. This is rapidly disconnecting the political parties from the political system the country has adopted at a great opportunity cost and from the economic system that must generate output to increase public well-being.Philosophically, socialism with intended control of the state is the opposite pole to federalism, which seeks to devolve political and economic power closer to the masses. But most of Nepal’s political parties are playing devout socialists and ardent federalists. So, it is no surprise that federalism has been able to produce only suboptimal results during the last seven years of its implementation. The subnational political and administrative units created akin to the federal setup for all practical purposes remain subservient to the power concentrated at the centre.

But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress.

Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepal’s nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepal’s transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Court’s order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top court’s directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a ‘zero draft’ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victims’ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victims’ consent mandatory. If a victim doesn’t want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top court’s directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the court’s directives. I can’t say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said ‘so and so’ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isn’t this akin to directing the court? Wouldn’t it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. It’s already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the country’s transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldn’t even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepal’s peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the ‘zero draft’ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didn’t the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Don’t you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldn’t we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldn’t be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Don’t you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this.
