The statement cited organizer Wayne Price as saying the assailant was “known to the police for orchestrating similar incidents in the past” and that Schwarzenegger was “fine and still in good spirits.” The actor confirmed he had no intention of pursuing charges and would continue with another appearance on Sunday as planned, the statement said."},{"hash":"c0bea6220d9fd1d863f2daffe0915bb81e7cf9491766462e24acad238217af12","title":"Amitabh Bachchan in 'pain', cancels Sunday meet","date":"Published Date: 2019-05-06 12:06:00","source":"np","link":"https://en.setopati.com/entertainment/145829","imageLink":"https://en.setopati.com/images/default.png","category":null,"content":"Megastar Amitabh Bachchan on Sunday afternoon informed his fans that he is cancelling the weekly meet and greet ritual due to ill health.

Drake turned up the love for his mom when he picked up top artist, besting Cardi B, Ariana Grande, Post Malone and Travis Scott. He won 12 awards Wednesday in Las Vegas, making his career total 27 (Swift has 23 wins). He looked up to the ceiling as he held the trophy, then said: “I just want to thank my mom for her relentless effort in my life. “I want to thank my mom for all the times you drove me to piano. All the times you drove me to basketball and hockey — that clearly didn’t work out. All the times you drove me to ‘Degrassi.’ No matter how long it took me to figure out what I wanted to do, you were always there to give me a ride, and now we’re on one hell of ride,” Drake said. Family bonding was a theme at the three-hour show, which aired live on NBC and was hosted by Kelly Clarkson Ciara’s young son and husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, danced along while she worked the stage, and Nick and Joe Jonas gave kisses to Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner of “Game of Thrones” fame when they sang in the audience before hitting the stage. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco looked to his parents as he accepted top rock song, quoting the name of his current hit: “Hey look Ma, I made it!” Mariah Carey’s twins cheered her on as she sang a medley of her hits and accepted the Icon award. She was in diva form before taking the award from Jennifer Hudson, throwing her napkin on the floor after dabbing her face with it. “Without getting into all the drama, all the ups and downs of my career ... I guess I always felt like an outsider, someone who doesn’t quite belong anywhere, and I still feel like that lost interracial child who had a lot of nerve to believe I could succeed at anything at all in this world. But, and this is the truth, I did believe because I had to,” she said. “The truth is I dedicated my life to my music — my saving grace — and to my fans.” Cardi B, the night’s top nominee with 21, locked lips with husband Offset on the red carpet and the couple sat closely inside the venue. She won six awards, including top Hot 100 song for “Girls Like You” with Maroon 5. “I remember when Maroon 5 hit me up to do this song. I was like, ‘Bro I’m five months pregnant. I can’t even breathe.’ But this record to me was so amazing. I was like, ‘Oh this is going to be a hit.’ And now I sing this song to my daughter because she’s the girl that I need,” she said. Drake and Cardi B — who both won multiple awards during the live telecast — used their speeches to promote love and appreciation for their peers in the music industry. Others, too, brought on the positive energy when onstage. Imagine Dragons’ band leader Dan Reynolds used his speech to highlight the dangers of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. He earned rousing applause. Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard followed suit, telling the audience after winning top country song: “In the spirit of so much truth being spoken tonight by so many talented artists, I think we should speak some truth.” “As artists we all get to experience so many unbelievable things, but in our opinion, at the end of the day, it’s all for nothing if you’re not using your platform for better ... to spread love, to help those in needs, to be a light to your community,” he said. Swift kicked off the show when she brought her new music video to life with a colorful, eye-popping performance of her song “ME!” Dancers wearing bright, pastel colors spun in the air holding umbrellas and a marching band kicked off Swift’s performance — like most of the world, maybe she was inspired by Beyonce’s new Coachella film? Madonna, wearing an eye-patch, teamed up with Colombian singer Maluma for a performance, but it was Grammy-winning Christian artist Lauren Daigle who had the night’s best performance. She sang “You Say,” giving the audience a calm, yet strong and powerful performance. She was backed by three awesome background singers and a pianist. BTS, who performed alongside Halsey, also had a major night. At the Billboard Awards and American Music Awards, the K-pop band had only previously won “social” awards based off their fanatic fan base, but on Wednesday BTS picked up top duo/group, besting Grammy-winning groups like Maroon 5, Imagine Dragons and Dan + Shay. “I still can’t believe we’re here on this stage with so many great artists,” RM said as fans screamed loudly. “We’re still the same boys from six years ago, we still have the same dreams ... we still have the same thoughts. Let us keep dreaming.” An unlikely winner at the Billboard Awards? “Game of Thrones” actress Maisie Williams, whose plays Arya Stark on the HBO series and shined brightly on last week’s episode. “Shout-out to Arya Stark for putting in that work last week,” Drake said onstage after winning his first award of the evening.","summary":"Mother’s Day is in a couple weeks, but Drake gave his mom an early gift with a heartfelt speech at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, where the rap star also broke Taylor Swift’s record for most wins.

This new method of farming is given the term “regenerative agriculture.” As the name goes, the idea behind such a movement is triggered by the need of the farming communities to lower their farm input expenditure, by helping farmers lessen their growing dependency on commercial fertilizers and pesticides, while at the same time able to grow enough food to feed the world’s growing population in a sustainable way.[1]\nThe failure of industrial farming and the search for an alternative model\nIndustrial farming which places heavy reliance on continuous application of external farm inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and inorganically derived chemical pesticides has dominated the agricultural landscape worldwide, more specifically in the western developed nations for more than a century. In its wake, such chemical-intensive ways of food production have left a trail of destruction on major environmental and ecological indicators worldwide, including crisis in human health, while exacerbating degradation of farmland, contamination of water bodies, and loss of biodiversity.[2]\nMany farmers after having practiced and endured chemical-intensive and large scale monocropping with the application of industrial farming methods for decades, seemed to be frustrated with the results, because their soil is giving up, farm productivity is declining, and farmers are not making enough money from agriculture to pay their loans and debts.[3]\nAs the price of factory-manufactured synthetic agricultural inputs has remained uncertain and volatile in the global market with skyrocketing prices of the same in recent times, farming occupation has added an extra layer of burden and mental stress to the farming communities, especially those practicing commercial farming and commodity-based agriculture.[4] This trend is palpable because chemical-intensive agricultural commercialization on larger farms demands huge capital investment from farmers, requiring them to purchase heavy tractors, farm equipment and agricultural machinery, alongside the need to maintain expensive irrigation infrastructure in place. Such capital-intensive farming with considerable initial investment from farmers often tends to overrun or exceed the anticipated economic returns, making such an approach to agriculture less promising and viable.[5,6]\n\nThe quality and nutritional value of food produced from such chemical-intensive monocultures is further questionable on health grounds raising concerns among many consumers and health-conscious souls.[7]\nFurthermore, an overwhelming number of research studies in recent decades have conclusively shown that chemical-intensive agriculture is not only untenable but also unsustainable to meet the growing food demands of the ever-increasing world population.[2,8,9,10] For instance, according to FAO report (2024), 733 million people worldwide are still confronting chronic hunger issues from lack of food, while 2.33 billion people – comprising 29% of the global population are facing food insecurity due to limited food access.[11] Such problems of food shortage and its inaccessibility is often seen in poor communities and among marginalized farmers who either lack the purchasing power to procure food to feed their families or are withheld from land ownership rights to grow their own food, compounded by other factors.[12] As such, the initial promise of industrial agriculture, and its purported ability to grow enough food in large mono-cropped farms to feed the growing human population for helping them overcome chronic food shortage and global hunger problem is fading into oblivion and becoming more unrealistic day by day.[5,8]\nFarming communities worldwide are therefore in search of an alternative pathway of food production and mainstream policy interventions that protects and builds soil, mitigates the negative effects of climate change, safeguards ecosystem function and biodiversity, while providing food access to the economically underprivileged.[13,14]  In other words, such an approach to farming must be regenerative and cost effective both in its philosophical underpinnings and in actual practice.\nThe promise of regenerative agriculture\nOne of the fundamental guiding principles behind the regenerative agricultural movement is that its followers recognize and treats soil as a living ecosystem that needs to be protected and conserved, and not simply an inert matter or medium for growing crops, as has often been misunderstood in the past, more so by the proponents of industrial agriculture enthusiasts. Such revelations about our renewed understanding of soil as a living biological entity have been scientifically proven through numerous research findings by soil microbiologists and allied scholars.[15,16,17] At the very least, regenerative agriculture should not only nurture soil health and protect the greater ecological landscape for the long term, but also should provide enough food for many with equitable access to land ownership, to combat world hunger and supply human nutritional needs.[18]\nThe followers of regenerative agriculture do not limit themselves to only adopting one single farming practice but a suite of land management practices, such as integrated farming, multiple cropping, agroforestry, minimum tillage, plantation of cover crops, permaculture, and other nature-based methods of soil regeneration.[19] The prime objective of regenerative agriculture is to create and nurture healthy soil through accumulation of organic matter and humus, which are the building blocks of life and soil microbial activity. The other promise of regenerative agriculture is its huge potential to combat the impending climate change crisis by its ability to sequester atmospheric carbon and restore it back to earth,[20] to where it originally belongs.\nThis evolving paradigm shift towards finding a better alternative for feeding humanity by remaining within the environmental boundaries and carrying capacity of nature is indispensable for our existence and survival. In view of this reality, the time-tested philosophy and concept of regenerative agriculture has its roots tied to the indigenous people worldviews that holds humans and nature as inseparable life forces, both having a mutual responsibility to nurture each other for its thriving and sustenance.[21] Therefore, the concept of regenerative agriculture is not new. Mimicking mother nature’s inherent grand design that has supported the mutual coexistence of a multitude of biological life forms for eons while sharing a common living space and environment, and interdependent on each other for food and survival, have been the cornerstone for understanding the underlying philosophy behind the regenerative agricultural movement worldwide.[22] In fact, such forms of benign agriculture, either knowingly or unknowingly, have been practiced for centuries by indigenous communities.[21] before the destructive modern industrial farming start to take shape with the false promise of feeding humanity with sufficient food and nutrition.\nIn the context of Nepal, adopting regenerative agricultural principles and practices by the farming communities is even more critical given that the country has only about one-fourth of its total geographical landmass that is considered to be arable land suitable for farming.[23] Several research studies have found that Nepal is already losing topsoil and soil organic matter that can sustain agricultural production at an alarming rate in recent decades.[24,25, 26] This is happening due to the adoption of unsustainable farming practices, aside from natural calamities, rapid urbanization, and other anthropogenic factors.[26] Hence, protection of Nepal’s limited land resource while relentlessly improving its productive potential with best management practices that align with regenerative agriculture’s objective and philosophy is vital for securing the country’s food security both in the short and long term.\nFinal Remarks\nAside from being highly capital-intensive nature of food production with higher risks of failure and diminishing economic returns, the other underlying reason why industrial farming model is losing the interest of farming communities globally is that it has its genesis rooted in maximizing short-term gains only, while disregarding the long-term sustenance of agroecological system[27]  – that often have its ability to self-regulate and thrive.\nIndustrial farming ever since it began its rampage with the high-held promise of maximizing farm yield and feeding the growing human population, start treating agriculture as a profit-maximizing tool by commodifying selective crops and capturing the market share of agricultural products, ultimately leading to the ubiquitous proliferation of ultra-processed foods, excessive consumerism, and waste generation.[28]\nThe proponents of the industrial farming model seemed to have succeeded very well so far in manipulating science through political lobbying and monetary power backed-up by large agricultural corporations.[29] As the industrial agricultural model and its pathway is mostly benefiting the rich and privileged power structure in society at the cost of many undernourished and the poor class, its farming model continue to break apart the natural process of life formation and soil regeneration, that has been perfected by nature for the last 3.7 billion years, when biological life is believed to have marked its origin on planet Earth.[30]\nThe central essence of this article can be summed up with the following message: It is easy to fool people and society, but one cannot fool nature. Nature has its own laws and rules to be obeyed. The underlying philosophy of regenerative agriculture seems to flow with the inherent blueprint and deeply rooted principles of nature and its life force, so it holds a high promise to feed the growing global human population while safeguarding our environment.\n References:\n\nKhangura, Ravjit, et al. “Regenerative agriculture—A literature review on the practices and mechanisms used to improve soil health.” Sustainability3 (2023): 2338.\nTilman, David, et al. “Agricultural sustainability and intensive production practices.” Nature6898 (2002): 671-677.\nKobayshsi-Solomon, Erik. “Conventional Farming is Killing Us and Our Planet” Forbes (2023).

Having earned his academic degrees from Nepal and Japan, he has collaborated with other coauthors to write research articles on sloth bear. He was the lead author of the research article titled ‘Habitat occupancy of sloth bear Melursus ursinus in ChitwanNational Park, Nepal’ which was published in Ecology and Evolution journal’s March 2022 issue. Talking to Birat Anupam of Nepal Press, Rajan Prasad Paudel has shared his academic and experimental insights on sloth bears of Nepal and around.\nAmong the various types of bears found in Nepal, you picked sloth bear from Nepal’s southern plains. Why so? \nI was unaware of bears in Nepal for a long time until I started my studies and work in biodiversity research and conservation. During my entire undergraduate and graduate studies, all I learned was about tigers, rhinos, and leopards. I learned how Nepal is a leading example in their preservation, how kings turned from poachers into conservationists, established rhino sanctuaries, and used hunting tigers and rhinos as a diplomatic tool to safeguard their state and their power. Our textbooks, articles, and news are about charismatic species, which many consider cute and attractive. Only when I started my professional work life did I begin to explore more wildlife. I discovered news that while the world focused and rejoiced in recovering the giant panda in China, other carnivore species were declining, and the focus on single-species conservation was insufficient to protect the other associated species’ communities and ecosystems. I was wondering if the same was happening with wildlife in Nepal. While we focus on conserving Tigers in Terai and Him Chituwa in the Himalayas, we might be slowly losing other carnivores like hyena, dholes and small cats and bears.\nAt NTNC, my supervisor, Dr. Naresh Subedi, introduced me to Prof. Tsubota from Japan, who was working on bears. Relatively, there were more groups and researchers working on species other than bears. It provided me with a unique opportunity to explore this species. Asiatic black bears and brown bears were more common in Europe and America, while sloth bears were rare and endemic to the Indian sub-continent and Sri Lanka. Besides this, a few studies were already ongoing on Asiatic black bears. Brown bears in Nepal were only seasonally seen as they stayed in Tibet most of the time. Further, Chure and Terai landscapes were more related to my upbringing, and I was more comfortable working in these landscapes. So I decided to work on sloth bears and  was fortunate enough to receive a MEXT scholarship from the Japanese government to complete my Ph.D.\nSloth bears dwell around Chitwan, Parsa and Bardiya national parks. What sorts of conservation works are going on to their conservation? \nCamera trapping and sign surveys are periodically being carried out in the park, which gives updates on the distribution of bears. This is vital by-catch information for bear conservation. Various conservation actions are being carried out, such as grassland management, but we do not have adequate information if these actions are benefitting bears or harming them. Awareness programs on human-wildlife conflict prevention are being carried out that address the sloth bear issues to some extent. Sloth bear-specific conservation actions are very rare. The conservation of sloth bears is incidental to the preservation of tigers and rhinos. Our conservation actions and priorities have not shifted much in the grounds.\nSloth bears endangered animal. What are the natural and human factors for this? \nGlobally and nationally, the population and its habitats are shrinking, which is the leading cause for its vulnerability. The major anthropogenic causes are habitat loss due to the expansion of agriculture, settlement, and developmental infrastructures. Sloth bears are the topmost species facing the greatest road expansion impact in South Asia. The capture of bear cubs and brutal training by tribal communities to use them as dancing bears for street entertainment used to be one of the major threats. Still, bears are killed for their bile, and there are other superstitions related to bears and their parts consumption that trigger poaching. Further, humans frequently enter the forests to collect wild fruits, honey, and other forest resources that disturb sloth bear habitat.\nSloth bears have existed in small and isolated patches. Continuous breeding among related individuals leads to the deterioration of genetic health, ultimately contributing to a decline in their fitness to survive. Sloth bear habitat across their range is experiencing changing land use, land cover, and climate. With changing temperature and precipitation regimes, vegetation structure and composition change, and plants and insects shift their distribution range, directly impacting sloth bears. Changing water tables, decreasing grassland habitats, and increasing invasive species may also impact sloth bears. Tigers are the only potential predators of sloth bears. An increase in the tiger population across their distribution range may have caused a decline in the sloth bear population.\nTermite, honey and wild fruits are major foods for sloth bears. It doesn’t eat meat by hunting. Still, there are reports of bear-human conflicts. Why such events are occurring? \nUnlike other omnivore bears, sloth bears have more insectivorous and seasonally frugivores. They do not kill to eat meat, but still, the conflict is occurring. We should be clear that in most cases (except some man-eater tigers), animals do not consider humans as natural prey, and they do not intend to kill or attack unless they feel threatened and feel the need to defend themselves.\nThe majority of human-sloth bear conflicts result in serious or minor injury to humans involved. These conflicts occur because many humans living around the park frequently visit the park for collection of forest resources, during which sudden encounters with bears lead to injuries and fatalities. Human casualties are the dominant form of human-sloth bear conflict, accounting for more than 95% of all recorded conflict cases. Livestock loss accounted for less than 5 % of the total cases of human-sloth bear conflict in Chitwan.\nMost conflicts with sloth bears occur when people are not alert enough and are engaged in activities like collecting wild vegetables, fodder, and fuelwood. Attacks occur due to poor visibility and high shrub cover along forest paths. Another reason is that sloth bears are naturally aggressive, and their aggressiveness increases during their reproduction and when females have cubs. The majority of attacks occur when a female tries to defend their cubs. Many victims (>60%) say that when the bear attacked them, they saw more than one bear in the area. As habitats have become fragmented and the population around parks is increasing, there are frequent encounters between bears and humans. Since there are no strict fences or boundaries between the park and human agriculture, land bears often venture outside of the park boundary. The migration of youth and the increasing trend of leaving barren lands may have further facilitated the movement of bears outside their core area and increased the chances of encounters and conflicts.\nSloth bears are found in Nepal, India and Sri Lanka. However, in the global discourse of sloth bear, India is mentioned most of the time. Why so? \nPioneer academic research and information on sloth ecology and behavior ear was done in Nepal in the late 70s by Laurie and Seidensticker and in the late 90s by Joshi and Garshelis. Many authors acknowledge this information on sloth bears from Nepal. However, there have been very few follow-up studies in Nepal compared to India. The media covered Sloth bears, and their appearance in the jungle book as Baloo popularized it as a product of India. Further, many sloth bears kept in zoos outside have been taken from India, popularizing it as occurring in India. Sloth bears were first described from India, and most of the distribution range and population is in India. In addition, this may also be driven by the strong scientific institutions backed up by India’s high political and economic influencing status.\nSloth bear carries baby in its back for almost seven to nine months something akin to kangaroo. Female sloth bear expecting baby stays in cave. Sloth bear doesn’t have teeth in its front. Besides, what are the other interesting features of sloth bears? \nIndeed, if we look closely at nature, we will see many fascinating and unique things. Generally, all the bear species are considered omnivores, but sloth bears have a unique feeding habit. It’s fascinating to know that the giant body of sloth bears results from consuming tiny little insects, mostly termites and ants. My study found that 90% of its diet comprises termites and ants. How many numbers of termites and ants would a bear consume in a month, can you imagine? Their nose has few hairs and it can open and close the nostrils as needed to help keep the insects crawling up inside the nose while slurping the ants and termites. Other than insects, they love to eat wild fruits. They are said to get intoxicated by consuming fruits like Mauha, similar to that of African elephants getting drunk by feeding on Marula fruits. They do not hunt to eat meat as other carnivores like tigers or leopards. But there was an interesting case of a sloth bear killing around 90 goats in Madi Valley, Chitwan. Such behavior is rare. A few times sloth bears are reported to consume carrion left by other predators. They are very good climbers and love to eat honey. Infantiside is often common in bears, and reported for sloth bears.\nSloth bear has average age of 40 and average weight of 80. Few months ago, while talking to journalists at Sauraha of Chitwan, you had talked about tourism potential of sloth bear in Nepal something similar to what Australia is doing from Kangaroo. How can we add tourism value to the sloth bear? \nThe Australian government is very strict about preserving its native flora and fauna. Kangaroos and koalas are very popular and promoted as symbols of Australia. The distribution, habitat, and behaviors of these species have been very well understood, and their unique features have been promoted in the tourism industry. Tourists can go on a Kangaroo safari, walk in the bushes to see Kangaroos or visit parks, rescue centers, and zoos where they have been kept in almost natural habitats. Sloth Bear provides a similar avenue for reaping benefits from nature-based tourism. Hotspots of sloth bear movements and den sites should be identified, and sloth bear trails should be located. Nature guides and tourism entrepreneurs should promote sloth bear viewing, walking, tracking, and other innovative ideas as tourism products. I have seen tourists satisfied after viewing sloth bears, even if they have not seen other wildlife. Injured, conflict-causing bears can be kept in a bear sanctuary and promoted as an educational and tourism center. Diversification of tourism services, innovative ideas and entrepreneurship is essential. Sloth Bear can boost nature-based tourism potential like kangaroo of Australia. Promoting sloth bear tourism would help spread the benefits of tourism beyond Chitwan for communities along the Churia landscape. I think this will take good investment and time. Current investment on sloth bears conservation is almost nil, very unsatisfactory. Its conservation is incidental to conservation efforts undertaken for other species like tigers and rhinos. Sloth bears need to be brought out of the shadow of tiger conservation.\nWhat are climate-related impacts on sloth bear? \nExact evidence of climate change impacts on sloth bears is unavailable as there have been limited studies. However, ample evidence suggests climate change impacts other bear species, such as the decline in ice cover and melting ice impact polar bears. Sloth bear habitats are expected to be affected by climate change. Grassland habitats are shrinking, and the impact of the spread of invasive species is increasing. Similarly, there are few specific studies on bear-specific fruit trees, but these are likely to shift their distribution ranges and fruiting timings. Similarly, the availability and abundance of termites and ants may change in response to changing temperature and moisture regimes. Modeling their occurrence in different scenarios of changing climate shows that their current protected area boundary may not be adequate to conserve sloth bears. More suitable habitats would be outside this PA boundary, where they must tackle increasing human pressure. Hibernation in bears is triggered by environmental cues; as climate warms and the weather becomes unpredictable, this behavior may change. Although sloth bears are not true hibernators, changing climate can impact their denning behavior. Sloth bears may go late into their dens and emerge faster and spend more time moving. Climate change-induced human-bear conflicts may rise in the future.\nLastly, anything you want to add? \nFor many households living near the forest, bears are a threat. I want to remember and thank all the parks staff, forest rangers, and community leaders who continuously work at the grassroots to minimize these threats, create opportunities for local communities, and promote harmonious human-wildlife co-existence.","summary":"KATHMANDU :  Rajan Prasad Paudel is Nepal’s noted researcher on sloth bear.

Our textbooks, articles, and news are about charismatic species, which many consider cute and attractive. Only when I started my professional work life did I begin to explore more wildlife. I discovered news that while the world focused and rejoiced in recovering the giant panda in China, other carnivore species were declining, and the focus on single-species conservation was insufficient to protect the other associated species’ communities and ecosystems. I was wondering if the same was happening with wildlife in Nepal. While we focus on conserving Tigers in Terai and Him Chituwa in the Himalayas, we might be slowly losing other carnivores like hyena, dholes and small cats and bears.\nAt NTNC, my supervisor, Dr. Naresh Subedi, introduced me to Prof. Tsubota from Japan, who was working on bears. Relatively, there were more groups and researchers working on species other than bears. It provided me with a unique opportunity to explore this species. Asiatic black bears and brown bears were more common in Europe and America, while sloth bears were rare and endemic to the Indian sub-continent and Sri Lanka. Besides this, a few studies were already ongoing on Asiatic black bears. Brown bears in Nepal were only seasonally seen as they stayed in Tibet most of the time. Further, Chure and Terai landscapes were more related to my upbringing, and I was more comfortable working in these landscapes. So I decided to work on sloth bears and  was fortunate enough to receive a MEXT scholarship from the Japanese government to complete my Ph.D.\nSloth bears dwell around Chitwan, Parsa and Bardiya national parks. What sorts of conservation works are going on to their conservation? \nCamera trapping and sign surveys are periodically being carried out in the park, which gives updates on the distribution of bears. This is vital by-catch information for bear conservation. Various conservation actions are being carried out, such as grassland management, but we do not have adequate information if these actions are benefitting bears or harming them. Awareness programs on human-wildlife conflict prevention are being carried out that address the sloth bear issues to some extent. Sloth bear-specific conservation actions are very rare. The conservation of sloth bears is incidental to the preservation of tigers and rhinos. Our conservation actions and priorities have not shifted much in the grounds.\nSloth bears endangered animal. What are the natural and human factors for this? \nGlobally and nationally, the population and its habitats are shrinking, which is the leading cause for its vulnerability. The major anthropogenic causes are habitat loss due to the expansion of agriculture, settlement, and developmental infrastructures. Sloth bears are the topmost species facing the greatest road expansion impact in South Asia. The capture of bear cubs and brutal training by tribal communities to use them as dancing bears for street entertainment used to be one of the major threats. Still, bears are killed for their bile, and there are other superstitions related to bears and their parts consumption that trigger poaching. Further, humans frequently enter the forests to collect wild fruits, honey, and other forest resources that disturb sloth bear habitat.\nSloth bears have existed in small and isolated patches. Continuous breeding among related individuals leads to the deterioration of genetic health, ultimately contributing to a decline in their fitness to survive. Sloth bear habitat across their range is experiencing changing land use, land cover, and climate. With changing temperature and precipitation regimes, vegetation structure and composition change, and plants and insects shift their distribution range, directly impacting sloth bears. Changing water tables, decreasing grassland habitats, and increasing invasive species may also impact sloth bears. Tigers are the only potential predators of sloth bears. An increase in the tiger population across their distribution range may have caused a decline in the sloth bear population.\nTermite, honey and wild fruits are major foods for sloth bears. It doesn’t eat meat by hunting. Still, there are reports of bear-human conflicts. Why such events are occurring? \nUnlike other omnivore bears, sloth bears have more insectivorous and seasonally frugivores. They do not kill to eat meat, but still, the conflict is occurring. We should be clear that in most cases (except some man-eater tigers), animals do not consider humans as natural prey, and they do not intend to kill or attack unless they feel threatened and feel the need to defend themselves.\nThe majority of human-sloth bear conflicts result in serious or minor injury to humans involved. These conflicts occur because many humans living around the park frequently visit the park for collection of forest resources, during which sudden encounters with bears lead to injuries and fatalities. Human casualties are the dominant form of human-sloth bear conflict, accounting for more than 95% of all recorded conflict cases. Livestock loss accounted for less than 5 % of the total cases of human-sloth bear conflict in Chitwan.\nMost conflicts with sloth bears occur when people are not alert enough and are engaged in activities like collecting wild vegetables, fodder, and fuelwood. Attacks occur due to poor visibility and high shrub cover along forest paths. Another reason is that sloth bears are naturally aggressive, and their aggressiveness increases during their reproduction and when females have cubs. The majority of attacks occur when a female tries to defend their cubs. Many victims (>60%) say that when the bear attacked them, they saw more than one bear in the area. As habitats have become fragmented and the population around parks is increasing, there are frequent encounters between bears and humans. Since there are no strict fences or boundaries between the park and human agriculture, land bears often venture outside of the park boundary. The migration of youth and the increasing trend of leaving barren lands may have further facilitated the movement of bears outside their core area and increased the chances of encounters and conflicts.\nSloth bears are found in Nepal, India and Sri Lanka. However, in the global discourse of sloth bear, India is mentioned most of the time. Why so? \nPioneer academic research and information on sloth ecology and behavior ear was done in Nepal in the late 70s by Laurie and Seidensticker and in the late 90s by Joshi and Garshelis. Many authors acknowledge this information on sloth bears from Nepal. However, there have been very few follow-up studies in Nepal compared to India. The media covered Sloth bears, and their appearance in the jungle book as Baloo popularized it as a product of India. Further, many sloth bears kept in zoos outside have been taken from India, popularizing it as occurring in India. Sloth bears were first described from India, and most of the distribution range and population is in India. In addition, this may also be driven by the strong scientific institutions backed up by India’s high political and economic influencing status.\nSloth bear carries baby in its back for almost seven to nine months something akin to kangaroo. Female sloth bear expecting baby stays in cave. Sloth bear doesn’t have teeth in its front. Besides, what are the other interesting features of sloth bears? \nIndeed, if we look closely at nature, we will see many fascinating and unique things. Generally, all the bear species are considered omnivores, but sloth bears have a unique feeding habit. It’s fascinating to know that the giant body of sloth bears results from consuming tiny little insects, mostly termites and ants. My study found that 90% of its diet comprises termites and ants. How many numbers of termites and ants would a bear consume in a month, can you imagine? Their nose has few hairs and it can open and close the nostrils as needed to help keep the insects crawling up inside the nose while slurping the ants and termites. Other than insects, they love to eat wild fruits. They are said to get intoxicated by consuming fruits like Mauha, similar to that of African elephants getting drunk by feeding on Marula fruits. They do not hunt to eat meat as other carnivores like tigers or leopards. But there was an interesting case of a sloth bear killing around 90 goats in Madi Valley, Chitwan. Such behavior is rare. A few times sloth bears are reported to consume carrion left by other predators. They are very good climbers and love to eat honey. Infantiside is often common in bears, and reported for sloth bears.\nSloth bear has average age of 40 and average weight of 80. Few months ago, while talking to journalists at Sauraha of Chitwan, you had talked about tourism potential of sloth bear in Nepal something similar to what Australia is doing from Kangaroo. How can we add tourism value to the sloth bear? \nThe Australian government is very strict about preserving its native flora and fauna. Kangaroos and koalas are very popular and promoted as symbols of Australia. The distribution, habitat, and behaviors of these species have been very well understood, and their unique features have been promoted in the tourism industry. Tourists can go on a Kangaroo safari, walk in the bushes to see Kangaroos or visit parks, rescue centers, and zoos where they have been kept in almost natural habitats. Sloth Bear provides a similar avenue for reaping benefits from nature-based tourism. Hotspots of sloth bear movements and den sites should be identified, and sloth bear trails should be located. Nature guides and tourism entrepreneurs should promote sloth bear viewing, walking, tracking, and other innovative ideas as tourism products. I have seen tourists satisfied after viewing sloth bears, even if they have not seen other wildlife. Injured, conflict-causing bears can be kept in a bear sanctuary and promoted as an educational and tourism center. Diversification of tourism services, innovative ideas and entrepreneurship is essential. Sloth Bear can boost nature-based tourism potential like kangaroo of Australia. Promoting sloth bear tourism would help spread the benefits of tourism beyond Chitwan for communities along the Churia landscape. I think this will take good investment and time. Current investment on sloth bears conservation is almost nil, very unsatisfactory. Its conservation is incidental to conservation efforts undertaken for other species like tigers and rhinos. Sloth bears need to be brought out of the shadow of tiger conservation.\nWhat are climate-related impacts on sloth bear? \nExact evidence of climate change impacts on sloth bears is unavailable as there have been limited studies. However, ample evidence suggests climate change impacts other bear species, such as the decline in ice cover and melting ice impact polar bears. Sloth bear habitats are expected to be affected by climate change. Grassland habitats are shrinking, and the impact of the spread of invasive species is increasing. Similarly, there are few specific studies on bear-specific fruit trees, but these are likely to shift their distribution ranges and fruiting timings. Similarly, the availability and abundance of termites and ants may change in response to changing temperature and moisture regimes. Modeling their occurrence in different scenarios of changing climate shows that their current protected area boundary may not be adequate to conserve sloth bears. More suitable habitats would be outside this PA boundary, where they must tackle increasing human pressure. Hibernation in bears is triggered by environmental cues; as climate warms and the weather becomes unpredictable, this behavior may change. Although sloth bears are not true hibernators, changing climate can impact their denning behavior. Sloth bears may go late into their dens and emerge faster and spend more time moving. Climate change-induced human-bear conflicts may rise in the future.\nLastly, anything you want to add? \nFor many households living near the forest, bears are a threat. I want to remember and thank all the parks staff, forest rangers, and community leaders who continuously work at the grassroots to minimize these threats, create opportunities for local communities, and promote harmonious human-wildlife co-existence."},{"hash":"86a11c893f646dedbbde85616676e8bc9229a0c7398f18f3f165cb2d58dca700","title":"“Topsoil protection should be the main focus to protect Nepal’s erodible landscapes and lead the country toward a sustainable agricultural path”","date":"Thu Sep 12 2024","source":"np","link":"https://english.nepalpress.com/2024/09/12/topsoil-protection-should-be-the-main-focus-to-protect-nepals-erodible-landscapes-and-lead-the-country-toward-a-sustainable-agricultural-path/","imageLink":"https://english.nepalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Suresh-Sharma.png","category":null,"content":"KATHMANDU: In an exclusive interview with Dr. Suresh Sharma, Nepal Press shares some thoughts on Nepalese agriculture and its future. Dr. Sharma is a leading expert in the field of sustainable and regenerative agriculture, as well as regional planning. Dr. Sharma has a Ph.D. in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, U.S.A. His doctoral study primarily focused on adopting sustainable agricultural practices by farming communities using socio-psychological behavioral theories and mixed research methods. He also holds two master’s degrees, one in Regional Development Planning from the prestigious SPRING program jointly offered by the University of Dortmund, Germany & University of the Philippines, Quezon City, and the other in Anthropology from Tribhuvan University (T.U.), Nepal. Having also acquired his primary bachelor’s degree in agriculture from T. U. Rampur campus in Chitwan, with nearly two decades of experience serving at a senior position in the Nepalese Government at various capacities in the Department of Agriculture and its wings, Dr. Sharma has some rich perspectives and ideas to share on Nepalese farming that could be beneficial to our nationwide readers, policymakers, and people abroad.\nExcerpts: \nBased on your rich experience working with the farming communities of Nepal spanning two decades, and serving as a senior extension official in the Department of Agriculture in the past, where do you think the problem lies when it comes to making agriculture a sustainable source of livelihood and income for Nepalese farmers?\nAgriculture has stood as the backbone of Nepalese economy for decades, still contributing almost one-fourth chunk of its GDP, however Nepalese farmers for the most part have hardly got the opportunity to rise above the subsistence level, when it comes to diversifying their income from agriculture. At least 80% of Nepal’s 19.5 million farming population are still bordering the poverty line and struggling to make their ends meet from agriculture. These farming communities are constantly faced with the challenge of reconciling their economic needs with farming as their principal source of income and livelihood support on the one hand, while protecting the productive capacity of their farmlands, on the other. These farmers need a clear roadmap of farming practices that they need to undertake which could not only support their farming occupation and livelihoods in the long term, but also safeguards their farmland against major environmental stressors such as the unfolding climate change crisis and unpredictable weather patterns posing considerable risks to subsistence-based farming. Nepalese farmers are often confronted to cope with prolonged droughts in some regions of the country, while navigating their lives with unforeseen precipitation in other parts, often resulting in flash floods and landslides, a major contributor of farmland degradation arising from topsoil loss and erosion.\nNepal have consistently lacked in bridging the polices and implementation gap over the years with regards to production increment of major cereal crops such as rice, wheat and maize including other cash crops, while protecting the environment, farmers’ wellbeing, and human health at the same time. The main problem in Nepalese agriculture lies in prioritizing resources to address the symptoms of the problems without addressing its underlying cause. I believe that agriculture in Nepal could reach to newer heights if we start to focus on the right polices and actions based on our rich ecological niche, varying climatic zones, and align human and financial resources accordingly to uplift the farming population with economic opportunities and technological access. However, at this point, it seems that the government and its partners are misguided over several decades by focusing resources and efforts in production and productivity enhancement of cereals, cash crops, and vegetables through forcibly carving a one-size-fits-all “commercialization of agriculture” bandwagon, through over-reliance and dependency on imported commercial fertilizers and pesticides. Such an approach to food production and poverty reduction has not served us well in the past, and therefore needs to change for the better.\n\nI think it would be more prudent to convey message to the farming communities in first prioritizing the protection of topsoil and conservation of its agricultural biodiversity through the widescale adoption of regenerative and sustainable farming practices applying time-tested agro-ecological principles. I firmly believe adoption of such an approach will yield sustainable and rewarding results in the long term. To accomplish this, the government and its partners need to provide farmers with the resources, tools, and needed support through grants, subsidies, and training along this direction. Although government policy documents hinted at striving to reach food self-sufficiency for its people, I seriously doubt this coveted goal could be achieved in the foreseeable future without first addressing the topsoil loss from erosion, and agrobiodiversity issue, which unfortunately are on a declining trend in Nepalese farming context.\nWhy conservation of topsoil is important in the context of Nepalese agriculture? Can you elaborate further?  \nGeologically, Nepal’s landmass is crafted and shaped from the constant collision of the tectonic plates underneath the Himalayas and is relatively young, as per scientific studies. As such, the topography of Nepal is a fragile landscape with mountains, hills, and terai cascading and overlapping in regions with varying relief features and climatic niches. Only one-fifth of the landmass of Nepal is arable land, capable of supporting farming. The rest of the country’s landmass comprised of sloping lands with rivers, valleys, gorges, and steep mountainous terrain. Since farmland is a scarce resource in Nepal, with average agricultural landholding of only 0.55 hectares, therefore, protection of this limited cultivable land is vital for ensuring food security for its 29.6 million population growing annually at 1.7%. Being a fragile and sloping topography especially in the Mid-hills and Churia (Siwalik) range, where agriculture is practiced by rural communities as the main source of livelihood support, Nepal’s farmland in this region is often prone to severe topsoil loss from erosion and landslides especially during the monsoon season.\nAccording to one recent study, Nepal is losing topsoil at an exceedingly high rate ranging from 11.2 tons per hectare up to 64 tons per hectare. When topsoil is lost at such an alarming rate, the capacity of the land to produce food and fiber for supporting people’s livelihood is compromised both in the short and long term. This is because topsoil is rich in organic matter, which often takes decades and centuries to form under the natural process and is the very essence of life-support system that provides resilience and sustainability to farmlands. Furthermore, the topsoil that is eroded from the hilly and mountainous region carrying huge amounts of silt and clay during the monsoon overwhelms the river system and farmlands in terai causing inundation, loss of crop production from sedimentation deposits, and displacement of farm families. On top of that, loss of lives and property from landslides and soil erosion is a regular phenomenon repeating every year in Nepal. Such natural calamities impose a significant burden on the national treasury in managing reparations, damages, and losses. It is evident that all these issues and problems are interconnected. Therefore, conservation of topsoil is critical for Nepal from the perspective of the country’s food security, protection of its rich agrobiodiversity, and building socio-economic resilience.\nCan you throw some light regarding agrobiodiversity decline in general and the case of Nepal in particular? How did this happen, and what should be done to address such an issue? \nAgrobiodiversity is the richness of genetic diversity of crops, seeds, and species of edible plants and other living organisms in a geographic region that are harbored by nature through generations following the natural selection process. Most of the plant agrobiodiversity available in nature comprises of different genus and species of crops and their cultivars that are open-pollinated. In other words, farmers can save the seeds of these open-pollinated crops for the next growing season. Agrobiodiversity decline occurs from multiple factors that includes both natural and anthropogenic. In the Nepalese context, when topsoil is lost through erosion or agricultural lands are converted into human settlements, which is already happening since the last several decades due to rapid urban sprawl in the country, a lot of the agrobiodiversity that was inherent within those landscapes is also lost in the process. Simultaneously, when farmers start to relinquish their open-pollinated crop cultivars and begin cultivating hybrid varieties on their farmlands for a few generations, then agrobiodiversity loss occurs rapidly. This happens because open-pollinated crops start to lose their viability to procreate if their seeds are not planted by farmers for a few years.\nThe practice of widescale monocropping with the advent of modern industrial farming, especially in developed countries, and subsequent upscaling of such monocultural practices in our part of the world, has also resulted in a significant loss of agrobiodiversity from farmlands. Once agrobiodiversity is lost from nature, it is gone forever. As per one recent study, out of 24,300 total species of agricultural genetic resources available in Nepal, the country has lost close to 40% of those species so far, and the trend of agrobiodiversity loss is worsening every year.\nNepal is not the only country that is facing the agrobiodiversity crisis, it is a global phenomenon, posing some dire consequences for the human species and the planet’s future. The best way to minimize or halt agrobiodiversity loss is through seed savings and conservation of genetic diversity by individual farmers and groups through farm diversification and by establishment of community seed banks. The government initiated National seed bank, for instance the one currently existing in Kathmandu valley under the management of National Agricultural Research Council, should be the last resort of hope toward seed conservation, because the cost of maintaining such a facility in terms of manpower, energy requirement, and resources is huge. Nevertheless, Nepal needs at least a couple of such seed banks in times of emergency. However, at this point, farmers and citizens awareness and actions toward promoting community seed banks is therefore the least costly and viable option for safeguarding against agrobiodiversity loss both in the case of Nepal and globally for ensuring food security for the current and future generations.\nWhat types of currently adopted agricultural practices and other development trends in Nepal are detrimental to safeguarding its long-term agricultural sustainability? \nWe have seen farming communities in Nepal growing annual crops like corn and millet even in sloping lands without proper terracing, resulting in a heavy loss of topsoil from erosion and landslides every year. The phenomena of topsoil loss are very much visible in sloping terraces especially after the heavy monsoon rains. This has resulted in degradation of farming landscapes with severe decline in soil productivity and its functionality over the years. The government needs to carve policies and actions that prohibit annual crop farming in high sloping lands while providing subsidies and motivating farmers to grow perennial grasses, forages, fodders, fruit trees, and shrubs as well as a combination of various conservation practices in steep and semi-steep slopes. Adoption of such a policy would result in protection of vulnerable and erodible landscapes, especially in the Mid- and High-hill regions against soil erosion and landslides, following heavy downpour especially in the monsoon season.\nAnother disturbing trend often observed in Nepal is the rapid conversion of its prime agricultural land into urban settlements and towns without consideration of its inherent land use potential and the capacity of such lands to support agricultural production and food security both in the long and short term. For example, as reported in one recent research study published in 2023, about 25% of the agricultural land in Kathmandu valley had been converted to urban settlements during the 10-year period from 2011-2021. Such development trend is often short-sighted and could result in unpredictability in food supply and long-term scarcity of food for the rapidly growing country’s population. Since Nepal is already a heavy importer of grains, pulses and other essential food commodities from its neighbors like India, China and other food exporters, what we have witnessed over several decades is that Nepal is reeling under an ever-increasing import-export imbalance and trade deficit. As such, it has become a moral imperative for Nepal to protect its prime agricultural land in the form of a regulated and sustainable land use policy to ensure its food security.\nWhat broad policy recommendations do you have for the Government of Nepal to make Nepalese agriculture sustainable and resilient? \nSome broad policy changes I would suggest for Nepal is to divest resources from commercial fertilizers and chemical pesticides importation and instead invest it in sustainable and regenerative agriculture both at the farm and landscape level. The government should provide substantial resources and technical support to the farming communities for motivating them in adopting a sustainable agricultural pathway. Given the vulnerability of its population already facing food insecurity especially in the remote regions, the widely used catchphrase “commercialization of agriculture” in the Nepalese context, may have been sending the wrong message to the farming communities. Farmers may connote this message to simply boost food production by adopting all available means of production, even though they are unsustainable. The main goal of a sustainable agricultural system should not be to only boost food production and sell it in the market for short-term economic return. Nepal must instead make every effort to train farmers and community members to produce food locally by building soil health and conserving its limited land resources to reach food self-sufficiency, without relying on synthetic fertilizers and agrochemicals. Research and efforts by farming communities from around the world have shown that reaching food self-sufficiency is not a distant dream if regenerative agricultural practices are adopted with a land conservation and stewardship mindset.\nFurthermore, Nepal urgently needs to curb unregulated infiltration of banned pesticides and agro-chemicals from its porous southern border. This could be achieved by strictly regulating its Plant Quarantine check posts at border points while revamping its monitoring and supervision capacities. Raising increased awareness among the farming communities and providing them the tools and resources needed in adopting sustainable practices on their farms is another viable way to tackle this issue in the long-term.\nAlongside, Nepal should massively invest its resources and efforts in regreening barren landscapes and degraded farmlands with afforestation by applying time-tested agroforestry principles and techniques. The end-goal should be to create a functional agricultural landscape and food forest where nature, people and biodiversity thrive together in perpetuity.","summary":"KATHMANDU: In an exclusive interview with Dr. Suresh Sharma, Nepal Press shares some thoughts on Nepalese agriculture and its future.

For example, as reported in one recent research study published in 2023, about 25% of the agricultural land in Kathmandu valley had been converted to urban settlements during the 10-year period from 2011-2021. Such development trend is often short-sighted and could result in unpredictability in food supply and long-term scarcity of food for the rapidly growing country’s population. Since Nepal is already a heavy importer of grains, pulses and other essential food commodities from its neighbors like India, China and other food exporters, what we have witnessed over several decades is that Nepal is reeling under an ever-increasing import-export imbalance and trade deficit. As such, it has become a moral imperative for Nepal to protect its prime agricultural land in the form of a regulated and sustainable land use policy to ensure its food security.\nWhat broad policy recommendations do you have for the Government of Nepal to make Nepalese agriculture sustainable and resilient? \nSome broad policy changes I would suggest for Nepal is to divest resources from commercial fertilizers and chemical pesticides importation and instead invest it in sustainable and regenerative agriculture both at the farm and landscape level. The government should provide substantial resources and technical support to the farming communities for motivating them in adopting a sustainable agricultural pathway. Given the vulnerability of its population already facing food insecurity especially in the remote regions, the widely used catchphrase “commercialization of agriculture” in the Nepalese context, may have been sending the wrong message to the farming communities. Farmers may connote this message to simply boost food production by adopting all available means of production, even though they are unsustainable. The main goal of a sustainable agricultural system should not be to only boost food production and sell it in the market for short-term economic return. Nepal must instead make every effort to train farmers and community members to produce food locally by building soil health and conserving its limited land resources to reach food self-sufficiency, without relying on synthetic fertilizers and agrochemicals. Research and efforts by farming communities from around the world have shown that reaching food self-sufficiency is not a distant dream if regenerative agricultural practices are adopted with a land conservation and stewardship mindset.\nFurthermore, Nepal urgently needs to curb unregulated infiltration of banned pesticides and agro-chemicals from its porous southern border. This could be achieved by strictly regulating its Plant Quarantine check posts at border points while revamping its monitoring and supervision capacities. Raising increased awareness among the farming communities and providing them the tools and resources needed in adopting sustainable practices on their farms is another viable way to tackle this issue in the long-term.\nAlongside, Nepal should massively invest its resources and efforts in regreening barren landscapes and degraded farmlands with afforestation by applying time-tested agroforestry principles and techniques. The end-goal should be to create a functional agricultural landscape and food forest where nature, people and biodiversity thrive together in perpetuity."},{"hash":"19015f1901b181346aa823f91670dc5f16bfeeebb44b6492d55b1ce3cc2aabbf","title":"WFP Nepal accused of ‘perpetuating hunger’ in Karnali, pressured to ‘review report’ on ending freebies","date":"Thu Jun 13 2024","source":"np","link":"https://english.nepalpress.com/2024/06/13/wfp-nepal-accused-of-perpetuating-hunger-in-karnali-pressured-to-review-report-on-ending-freebies/","imageLink":"https://english.nepalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/UN-WFP-himbu.png","category":null,"content":"KATHMANDU: In what appears to be in line with widespread accusations that donor agencies want to continue hunger to profit from their philanthropic deeds, a recent book has unveiled that the World Food Program (WFP) is intentionally perpetuating hunger in Nepal’s Karnali region to profit from their philanthropic efforts.\nIn ‘Himbu’, an autobiography by Nepal’s renowned tourism entrepreneur Mr. Lhakpa Sonam Sherpa, the author sheds light on these claims from both an insider and outsider perspective.\nSherpa, who has airlifted WFP-supported food to Karnali for 18 years from his Tara Air, shares his firsthand experience with distributing free food in the region.

This interconnectedness is a powerful reminder that our choices, no matter how insignificant they may seem, ripple across the globe, affecting not just our lives but also the environment and those in distant lands.\nWhen a person in a distant country decides to drive a little more, thinking it won’t make a difference, that choice could indirectly contribute to the melting glaciers in the majestic mountains of Nepal. This illustrates how deeply interconnected our global system truly is. The boundaries that separate us—whether a country is classified as less developed, developing, or developed—blur in the face of the climate crisis.\nAs we reflect on these connections, we must confront a crucial question: who is responsible for these global changes, and who bears the brunt of their consequences? In this web of complex global connections, we are all part of the same story. Every action counts, and our collective story is shaped by our choices.\nSome countries, like Tuvalu—a small island developing state located halfway between Hawaii and Australia—exemplify the grave injustice inherent in this situation. The people of Tuvalu, with one of the smallest per-capita carbon footprints globally, grapple daily with the consequences of climate change, struggling to cultivate their staple foods as rising tides sweep away their land. Nepal, too, finds itself on the front lines, paying a heavy price for a crisis it did not cause.\nOne recent tragedy in Nepal underscores the country’s vulnerability. This year’s monsoon season brought extreme, erratic rainfall—some of the heaviest in over 50 years—triggering catastrophic floods and landslides that claimed dozens of lives. Within a few days, more than 200 people lost their lives, while many others were injured or displaced as homes, roads, and infrastructure were swept away. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, and rainfall patterns are growing increasingly unpredictable, both of which can be linked to climate change.\nSimilarly, the spread of malaria to Nepal’s mountainous regions is a troubling sign of climate change. Historically, malaria was virtually unknown in these colder areas, but rising temperatures have allowed mosquitoes to thrive. In a remote village in far-western Nepal, over 900 malaria cases have been reported in the last three years—a significant increase for an area that was once free of such diseases. A community health volunteer in the region shared that the health burden has worsened as warmer temperatures make it easier for mosquitoes to breed in these high-altitude areas.\nAnother such story is about the rain-shadow zone in Nepal, traditionally a dry region even during the monsoon season. However, rising temperatures are now causing more intense and frequent rains, resulting in landslides and floods that contaminate local water sources. What used to be a reliable supply of fresh meltwater is now often polluted, leading to frequent diarrhea and other health problems. As a result, waterborne diseases have become the second most significant health concern for the village’s residents.\nWhile people in such remote regions may not be familiar with terms like “climate change” or “global warming,” their experiences reflect its impact. Sadly, their stories often go unheard, both within their country and at international gatherings like COP.\nAs the COP 29 climate summit approaches this November in Azerbaijan, the question remains: will the voices of vulnerable nations like Nepal be heard? It seems as though the focus lies on setting an increased target for the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), but little attention is given to the strategic approach needed for managing these funds, given the inconsistencies observed in previous years.\nAccording to OECD data, 2022 marked a significant milestone: climate finance finally surpassed the US$100 billion target set in 2009, reaching US$115.9 billion. While this achievement came two years later than the original 2020 goal, it still represents a crucial step forward. However, it’s essential to examine how these funds have been allocated to support the most vulnerable populations.\nFrom 2015 to 2020, developed countries paid approximately $353 billion, with $189 billion coming from direct country-to-country payments. While these payments were intended as donations to support developing nations, 54% of the funding was provided as loans, leading to increased debt challenges for countries grappling with problems largely caused by the developed world.\nIn 2022, climate finance directed toward low-income countries remained relatively low, accounting for only 10%. The OECD report revealed that, similar to prior years, public climate finance was predominantly composed of loans, which represented 69% or $63.6 billion. Not all of these loans were concessional; some were provided at market rates. In comparison, grants constituted only 28% of the total, amounting to $25.6 billion, while equity investments were even less significant at $2.4 billion.\nThis approach of giving funds as loans at market rates is unusual for climate-related and other aid projects, which typically feature low or zero interest rates. Therefore, even if the pledge is fulfilled, we can conclude that it is exaggerated, as donor countries will redeem a significant portion of the climate finance through loan repayments and interest.\nSurprisingly, investments in retail stores, hotels, airports, and movie theaters have been classified as climate finance. For instance, Italy has invested in Asia to establish chocolate and gelato shops, while the United States provided loans to Haiti for developing coastal hotels. Meanwhile, Japan funded a new coal plant in Bangladesh and supported airport expansion in Egypt. These peculiar investments are being labeled as climate finance, despite the absence of official guidelines to regulate such activities. The responsible entity, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), seems more focused on tallying numbers than on making a genuine impact on climate change issues in the affected countries.\nThe goal of mobilizing $100 billion annually for climate action, as agreed upon in the Paris Agreement, can be seen through the lens of the butterfly effect. Investing in renewable energy, conservation, and adaptation strategies can lead to profound shifts in global carbon emissions, biodiversity, and community resilience.\nWhile climate finance is intended to support the poorest nations as compensation from developed countries, it has increasingly become a mechanism through which rich countries provide climate funding with interest attached. Climate finance has become a business venture, and money is being redirected back to the respective donor economies. As a result, vulnerable nations are stuck in a vicious cycle. With extreme weather conditions, they face economic losses that leave them with no other option but to take loans from developed countries. With heavy debt, they will have fewer resources to invest in climate solutions, further increasing the risk of climate stress. A report from the United Nations Development Program shows that fifty-four nations, including Egypt, Kenya, and Sri Lanka, which are heavily indebted by climate loans, are facing higher costs due to climate change.\nGiven such inconsistencies in fund allocation and effectiveness, there is a need to highlight the importance of a more thoughtful approach. As COP 29 approaches, it is imperative that discussions go beyond mere financial commitments and recognize the significance of equitable climate finance, ensuring that funds are allocated effectively to support those most affected. By prioritizing grants over loans and investing in genuine solutions rather than superficial projects, we can harness the power of collective action to create a positive ripple effect.\nJust as the flap of a butterfly’s wings can set off far-reaching changes, so too can the conscious choices of developed nations in climate finance help foster resilience, promote sustainability, and bridge the global inequities at the heart of the climate crisis. In the face of growing climate challenges, vulnerable countries like Nepal need genuine investment and immediate support—not empty promises or token gestures. As climate impacts intensify, the world’s most vulnerable countries must not be left to navigate this crisis alone.","summary":"KATHMANDU: The butterfly effect is the idea that even the smallest action—a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world—can set off a chain of events that leads to far-reaching consequences.

But how we design and maintain infrastructure determines if hazards turn into disasters. Since today’s decisions affect the future, it is crucial that development be risk-sensitive. Disasters are not natural, they are the results of risk-insensitive development activities. For instance, in 2021/22 in a village in western Nepal, when technicians were planning to construct a bridge across the Mahadeva River, locals suggested a different alignment of the bridge to avoid the annual monsoon flood, which they face annually. However, the technicians disregarded communities’ suggestions and constructed what they thought was the best design. The next year, the flood entered the village. Likewise, in another Rural Municipality of the same region, locals suggested not constructing a hospital near a local river called Dolai, which is flood-prone, but again their suggestion was not considered. Now the hospital is vulnerable to inundation during seasonal monsoon rains. If a hazard is amplified to a disaster due to the ignorance of individuals (e.g. authorities, technicians and households) of local geography, risk histories, knowledge and community participation, we call it an “engineered disaster”.\nThe above are just representative examples of the ways in which development can create risk in Nepal. Every year, hundreds of such infrastructures are constructed without the knowledge and study of local risk geographies exposing them to hazards. The floods and landslides triggered by the 26-28 September 2024 rainfall, which took the lives of more than 240 people and loss of valuable infrastructure (e.g. roads, irrigation, energy, water, agriculture, etc.) incurring more than 15 billion Nepali rupees (initial estimation), were amplified due to the prevalence of infrastructure and houses on the banks of rivers. Given the huge loss Nepal experienced in the September 2024 catastrophe, we have the following five suggestions for future risk-sensitive development and urbanization. Implementing these is essential for Nepal to achieve a risk-resilient society as envisioned by the National Climate Change Policy 2019.\nFirst\nJust as countries located near the sea teach swimming to their citizens, given Nepal’s exposure to various hazards, providing education in geography and geology should be an integral part of the school-to-university education system, especially for those teaching technical subjects. Additionally, with its width ranging from lowland southern Tarai (<300 meters above sea level) to the Himalaya (8848 masl i.e. Mt. Everest) within around 200 kilometers, the geomorphology, climate and vegetation resemble areas ranging from equatorial to polar regions. So, the engineering methods used in the Tarai may not fit in the Hill and Himalayan regions. The models, methods and formulas used in other countries will need to be customized to fit local geography and geology. Without this, infrastructures turn into the very tools for amplifying hazard and disaster impacts, leading to the creation of more engineered disasters.\nSecond\nThe government has to regulate the haphazard expansion of settlements and the excavation of sand and rocks near river banks and upstream areas immediately. The widespread disaster caused by the September floods in the Kathmandu Valley was also due to the mining in river banks for construction materials. The growing construction in the surrounding hills (locally called kanth) and lowland areas (dol) of the Kathmandu Valley led rainfall water to flow directly into the main river, triggering overflowing and flooding. Additionally, the huge destruction that occurred in the Roshi River (Kavrepalanchwok district) and Nakhkhu River (Lalitpur district) was a great consequence of such haphazard excavation. Learning from the September 2024 disaster, therefore, the government has to focus on regulating haphazard construction and excavation as a national priority.\nThird\nThe haphazard road construction in the mid-hills region, an area of relatively soft geology, has led to increased landslide hazard. Without considering slope stability and monsoon water management during the construction, such roads can turn into creeks. Runoff can mix downstream rivers with debris including soil, sand, leaves and small rocks causing lateral erosion and landslides en route. Such disasters had already occurred in Nepal. Therefore, such haphazard road construction has to be highly regulated to encourage only the construction of high-quality and risk-resilient roads targeting local economic development.\nFourth\nImportantly, risk analysis is not routinely undertaken before infrastructure development. This should be an essential early step for risk reduction of potential hazards. For instance, if the risk analysis of the Melamchi Water Project (Sindhupalchwok district) had been done, we could have avoided the loss of huge destruction caused by landslides in June 2021. By studying the local geography, drainage system, past hazards, we could assess and avoid the potential impacts of construction on local geography and society thereby the sustainability and resilience of infrastructures. Hazards are a natural phenomenon, therefore if we, for example, can spend an additional 1 rupee for risk reduction at present we could avoid disaster equivalent to 10 rupees in the future. Alternatively, continuing infrastructure development without risk analysis means we are creating a favorable environment for future disasters.\nFifth\nNepal is highly vulnerable to landslides, floods, fires, earthquakes and climate change so the agencies related to risk management during and after disasters must be fully prepared. Unfortunately, the amplified catastrophe of September 2024 was also due to the government’s delayed rescue operation. For instance, in the September flood, four people standing on the roof of their house, which was corralled by the Nakkhu River flood, called for help for several hours but unluckily nobody reached there for help. The river swept their house, luckily two survived. Moreover, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology alerted the government regarding the September heavy rainfall and potential disasters more than a week before, the disaster management apertures of the government could not prepare and make necessary decisions in advance, consequently, people faced a huge loss. To avoid similar blunders in future, the risk reduction and management (e.g. rescue and relief) departments and line agencies must be in the ready-to-go form throughout the year.\nFinally, another rainfall akin to September 2024 could reoccur in Nepal. It may take a couple of decades, but there is a high chance of the reoccurrence. Therefore, to meet the goal of the National Climate Change Policy 2019, the three tiers of the government i.e. federal, provincial and local should consider, as suggested above, developing a risk-resilient society by considering local risk geography and promoting risk-sensitive infrastructure development in their constituencies from today.\nDr. Poudel is associated with Southasia Institute of Advanced Studies (SIAS), Nepal and Dr. Pelling is associated with University College London (UCL), United Kingdom","summary":"Phenomena like floods, landslides and earthquakes are the medium of hazard.

The growing construction in the surrounding hills (locally called kanth) and lowland areas (dol) of the Kathmandu Valley led rainfall water to flow directly into the main river, triggering overflowing and flooding. Additionally, the huge destruction that occurred in the Roshi River (Kavrepalanchwok district) and Nakhkhu River (Lalitpur district) was a great consequence of such haphazard excavation. Learning from the September 2024 disaster, therefore, the government has to focus on regulating haphazard construction and excavation as a national priority.\nThird\nThe haphazard road construction in the mid-hills region, an area of relatively soft geology, has led to increased landslide hazard. Without considering slope stability and monsoon water management during the construction, such roads can turn into creeks. Runoff can mix downstream rivers with debris including soil, sand, leaves and small rocks causing lateral erosion and landslides en route. Such disasters had already occurred in Nepal. Therefore, such haphazard road construction has to be highly regulated to encourage only the construction of high-quality and risk-resilient roads targeting local economic development.\nFourth\nImportantly, risk analysis is not routinely undertaken before infrastructure development. This should be an essential early step for risk reduction of potential hazards. For instance, if the risk analysis of the Melamchi Water Project (Sindhupalchwok district) had been done, we could have avoided the loss of huge destruction caused by landslides in June 2021. By studying the local geography, drainage system, past hazards, we could assess and avoid the potential impacts of construction on local geography and society thereby the sustainability and resilience of infrastructures. Hazards are a natural phenomenon, therefore if we, for example, can spend an additional 1 rupee for risk reduction at present we could avoid disaster equivalent to 10 rupees in the future. Alternatively, continuing infrastructure development without risk analysis means we are creating a favorable environment for future disasters.\nFifth\nNepal is highly vulnerable to landslides, floods, fires, earthquakes and climate change so the agencies related to risk management during and after disasters must be fully prepared. Unfortunately, the amplified catastrophe of September 2024 was also due to the government’s delayed rescue operation. For instance, in the September flood, four people standing on the roof of their house, which was corralled by the Nakkhu River flood, called for help for several hours but unluckily nobody reached there for help. The river swept their house, luckily two survived. Moreover, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology alerted the government regarding the September heavy rainfall and potential disasters more than a week before, the disaster management apertures of the government could not prepare and make necessary decisions in advance, consequently, people faced a huge loss. To avoid similar blunders in future, the risk reduction and management (e.g. rescue and relief) departments and line agencies must be in the ready-to-go form throughout the year.\nFinally, another rainfall akin to September 2024 could reoccur in Nepal. It may take a couple of decades, but there is a high chance of the reoccurrence. Therefore, to meet the goal of the National Climate Change Policy 2019, the three tiers of the government i.e. federal, provincial and local should consider, as suggested above, developing a risk-resilient society by considering local risk geography and promoting risk-sensitive infrastructure development in their constituencies from today.\nDr. Poudel is associated with Southasia Institute of Advanced Studies (SIAS), Nepal and Dr. Pelling is associated with University College London (UCL), United Kingdom"},{"hash":"7f440f59d02bad7072be7be5e7a35557383448b3e5e3ca456836b46d8d29830a","title":"Airport","date":"Sun Sep 22 2024","source":"np","link":"https://english.nepalpress.com/2024/09/22/airport/","imageLink":"https://english.nepalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Prakash.jpg","category":null,"content":"I am at Bergamo Airport, Italy,\nheading back to my home in Norway.\nI’m in quite a hurry carrying the baggage of responsibility.\n \ndoing security check,\nboarding pass check,\nIdentity Card check.\n \nSome passengers are sleepy,\nsome are tired.\n \nLike me, they’re in a hurry too.\n”From Bergamo to Oslo.

This year holds significant importance in Nepal’s diplomatic standing. On December 14, Nepal appointed Sewa Lamsal as the first woman secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Alongside this milestone, there are several other noteworthy diplomatic events in the oldest sovereign country in South Asia over the past 12 months. Here, we discuss Nepal’s 23 major diplomatic events of 2023:\n1. Pokhara International Airport operation: Nepal’s new year in 2023 began with the addition of a new international airport. The China-financed and constructed airport was formally inaugurated on 1 January. However, it did make the first international flight only on 21 June when a chartered flight from China carrying Ganesh Timalsina, chair of Nepal’s National Assembly and Chinese players for Nepal’s first Dragon Boat Festival. Chinese ambassador to Nepal Chen Song said the airport was part of BRI. After some criticism from the Nepali side that the airport concept was older than BRI’s birth, he didn’t repeat the same phrasing in his other publicly available statements and interviews. Pokhara International Airport has not been operational internationally. On 15 January, Yeti Airlines Flight 691 crashed nearby this airport killing all 72 people onboard.\n2.Four new diplomatic relations: Nepal established new diplomatic ties with four different countries in 2023: Republic of Malawi on February 16, Republic of Nauru on May 4, Republic of Cameroon on June 22, and Republic of Marshall Islands on June 23.\n3.Fake Bhutanese Refugee Scam: May witnessed the arrests of top political and bureaucratic figures in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. Former Deputy Prime Minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and Former Home Minister Balkrishna Khanda were among those arrested.\n4.India visit: Prime Minister Prachanda made a four-day visit to India from May 31 to June 3. His notable outcomes included India’s commitment to purchasing 10,000 megawatts of electricity in the upcoming decade and his counterpart Modi’s acknowledgment that Nepal and India have border problems. Controversially, Modi traveled to a village on Nepal’s border that is considered India-occupied on October 13.\n5.Nepal-Bangladesh power trade: On July 8, Nepal and Bangladesh formally agreed to enter into a long-term electricity export deal from Nepal, with an expected export volume of 40 megawatts. Talks are underway regarding a trilateral hydroelectricity investment involving Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.\n6. China visit: PM Prachanda made an 8-day official visit to China from September 22 to 29. His notable takeaways include the signing of a dozen agreements and memoranda of understanding. These agreements involve Nepal’s shift from the ‘One-China policy’ to the ‘One-China principle,’ as well as the reopening and addition of more bilateral border crossings.\n7. Hamas attacks: On October 7, during Hamas attacks on Israel, ten Nepali students were confirmed killed a day later. Nepal airlifted its citizens on October 11. A Nepali student named Bipin Joshi is still in Hamas captivity.\n8. Russian Ukraine war: On December 4, four Nepalis were officially confirmed killed while fighting alongside Russian forces. The confirmed figure has now reached seven. Four Nepalis are in Ukrainian capture. Nepal has lobbied both Russia and Ukraine to send back Nepalis, but to no avail.\n9. SAARC’s new Secretary General in Kathmandu: In the last week of October, SAARC’s new Secretary-General from Bangladesh, Golam Salwar, assumed his office in Kathmandu. Despite being dysfunctional since its last Kathmandu summit in 2014, SAARC has been paralyzed. However, it has not stopped breathing.\n10. UN Secretary-General arrival in Nepal: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made an official visit to Nepal from October 29 to November 1. He made Himalayan visit and talked about climate crisis in the Himalayas. He gave speech at Nepal’s joint sessions of houses and voiced for justice to conflict victims based on victim-centric international judicial practices.\n11. PM’s Temple diplomacy: Temple diplomacy was a new incarnation of PM Prachanda. From Mahakaleshwar of India (June 2) to Mt. Kailash of China’s Tibet Autonomous Region (September 28) and the visit to Nepal’s Pashupatinath Temple, among others, displayed his temple diplomacy to please Hindu quarters.\n12. North Korean exit: In the first week of November, North Korea formally closed its almost 50-year-old diplomatic mission in Kathmandu. It has assigned its existing New Delhi mission for Nepal’s affairs. With this, Kim Yong Su became the last residential North Korean ambassador to Nepal. He and his entire team left Nepal in the second week of November. He made a farewell call to PM Prachanda before his departure.\n13. Portugal outreach: On November 9, Nepal’s cabinet decided to open a new embassy in Lisbon, Portugal’s capital. At least 20,000 Nepalis are said to have resided in Portugal. Sanil Nepal was picked as the first ambassador from Nepal this month.\n14. Defeat in WHO regional elections: In what appeared to signal Nepal’s diplomatic failure, Nepal witnessed a humiliating defeat for the WHO Regional Director position with the Bangladeshi candidate on November 1. Out of 10 votes, Nepal’s candidate Dr. Shambhu Acharya secured just two votes against the Bangladeshi candidate Sheikh Hasina Wazed.\n15. COP-28: PM Prachanda left for the COP-28 venue in the UAE on November 28. He returned to Nepal on December 3. He gave his speech on December 3. He was also part of the 52nd National Unity Day and ‘Sayed Sustainability Award’ in the UAE. He had bilateral meetings with the UN Secretary-General and some other world leaders, including Indian PM Modi. The issue of Himalayan glacial melt was one of the notable issues at COP-28.\n16. Italy visit: PM Prachanda visited Italy from July 22 to 28. While in Rome, he participated in the WFO-organized ‘Food System Summit +2.’ During his speech, PM Dahal represented Least Developed Countries (LDC) and emphasized increased agricultural investment. Throughout his stay in Rome, he also conducted bilateral meetings with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, among others.\n17. Qatar: Qatar came into the spotlight of Nepal’s diplomacy for three reasons. First, PM Prachanda’s scheduled and canceled visit on February 27. He was supposed to attend a program of the Fifth Conference of the Least Developed Countries and was set to leave the country on March 3. He canceled his visit on February 27 for ‘important political engagements’ in Nepal. If he had visited Qatar, it would have been his first foreign visit. Second reason of Qatari issues was a possible visit by a high level from the gas-rich Arab country. Third reason was Qatar’s potential to meditate for the release of Nepali student Bipin Joshi from Hamas activity.\n18. Australian Minister visit: Australia’s Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts visited Kathmandu from May 16 to 17. He paid a visit to the Hindu shrine of Pashupatinath. As Australia becomes one of the most favored destinations for Nepali students, more top-level visits between the two countries are expected.\n19. MCC: The American project of MCC was ratified by Nepal’s parliament last year. However, the $500 million project is still in limbo when it comes to visible outcomes. Despite no tangible MCC outcomes for transmission lines and roadways, there were high-level visits from the US, including the February 7 visit of the Administrator of the USAID Samantha Power and the July 13 visit of US Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, among others.\n20. BRF: So far, there are no tangible infrastructural outcomes of Nepal’s participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since the first Belt and Road Forum (BRF) in 2017. However, Nepal was not absent in the Third Belt and Road Forum which was held in Beijing from October 17 to 18. Nepal’s delegation was led by Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha.\n21. Electricity trade with China: While claiming the one-year ‘success’ of his government, PM Prachanda highlighted the first ongoing trans-Himalayan transmission lines between Nepal and China. He stated that works are underway to erect the Chilime-Kerung 220 kV transmission lines. When this comes into operation, it would be an added option for Nepal’s incumbent India-dependent energy trade.\n22. Asian Games and Asia Cup Goodwill: From a sporting perspective, Nepal’s two medals at the Hangzhou Asian Games, praiseworthy cricketing performance against heavyweight cricketing nations at the Asia Cup from August 30 to September 17, and participation in the Asian Games from September 23 to October 8 were noted as part of Nepal’s sporting goodwill.\n23. Nepal’s absence in Raisina Dialogue and G-20 Summit: Two notable physical events in Nepal’s southern neighbor were the Raisina Dialogue, held from March 2 to 4 and supported by the Indian Government, which invited many world leaders but not Nepali representatives. Likewise, in the G-20 summit from September 9 to 10, Nepal was absent among the invitees.","summary":"KATHMANDU:  Today is the penultimate day of 2023.

All of Lahaina is burnt to a crisp. It’s like an apocalypse,” said Lahaina resident Mason Jarvi, who escaped from the city.\nJarvi showed Reuters pictures he took of the ashen-colored destruction along the Lahaina waterfront. Wearing shorts, he also showed blisters on his thigh that he said he suffered when riding through flames on his electric bike to save his dog.\n\n\n\n\nOfficials said the winds from Hurricane Dora, hundreds of miles to the southwest, had fanned the flames across the state.\n\n\n\n\nThe Hawaii Emergency Management Agency said late on Wednesday that the National Weather Service has canceled the “Red Flag Warning” and “High Wind Advisory” for all Hawaiian islands.\nBut Maui County officials said firefighting efforts were ongoing.

The state said thousands of acres burned.\nTOURISTS FLEE\nMore than 11,000 travelers were evacuated from Maui, Ed Sniffen of the Hawaii Department of Transportation said late on Wednesday. Though at least 16 roads were closed, the Maui airport was operating fully and airlines were dropping fares and offering waivers to get people off the island, Sniffen had said earlier in the day.\n“We have now opened Honopilani Highway and Lahaina Bypass, which was shut down for most of the day to make sure that we get everybody to the airport,” he added.\nPanicked evacuees posted images on social media showing clouds of smoke billowing over once-idyllic beaches and palm trees.\n“I was the last one off the dock when the firestorm came through the banyan trees and took everything with it. And I just ran out and helped everyone I could along the way,” said Dustin Johnson, who was in Lahaina Harbor working for a charter boat company that offers two-hour tours. He spoke from Kahului Airport, normally a 25-minute drive east of Lahaina.\nSome people were forced to jump into the Pacific Ocean to escape the smoke and fire conditions, prompting the U.S. Coast Guard to rescue them, according to a Maui County press release.\nOfficials said they were looking into witness reports of people being trapped in their cars.\n“Local people have lost everything. They’ve lost their house. They’ve lost their animals.

We have resources that are being taxed,” she added.\nSUMMER OF WILDFIRES\nThe situation in Hawaii recalled scenes of devastation elsewhere in the world this summer, as wildfires caused by record-setting heat forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people in Greece, Spain, Portugal and other parts of Europe, and western Canada suffered unusually severe fires.\nHuman-caused climate change, driven by fossil fuel use, is increasing the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events, scientists say, having long warned that government officials must slash emissions to prevent climate catastrophe.\nThe White House issued a message of condolence from President Joe Biden, who praised the work of firefighters and ordered “all available Federal assets on the Islands to help with response.”\nThe National Guard, U.S. Navy, Marines and Coast Guard were mobilized, while the U.S. Department of Transportation aided evacuation efforts, Biden said.\nThe cause in Maui had yet to be determined but the National Weather Service said the fires were fueled by a mix of dry vegetation, strong winds, and low humidity.\nReporting by Marco Garcia in Kahului; Additional reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta, Brendan O’Brien in Chicago, Julia Harte in New York, and Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Aurora Ellis, Sandra Maler, Shri Navaratnam and Alex Richardson.","summary":"At least 36 people have died after wildfires, fanned by winds from a faraway hurricane, devastated much of the resort city Lahaina on Hawaii’s Maui island, the Maui County said in a statement late on Wednesday, Reuters reported.\nMultiple neighborhoods were burnt to the ground as the western side of the island was nearly cut off, with only one highway open and thousands to evacuate as officials told of widespread devastation to Lahaina, its harbor and surrounding areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome people fled into the ocean to escape the smoke and flames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We just had the worst disaster I’ve ever seen.

Huawei is willing to work with all of you to build digital and intelligent infrastructure, win in the new era, and create a better future,” said Shi.\nAccelerating the popularization of ICT infrastructure enables more partners and customers to seamlessly integrate, access, and use ICT infrastructure, allowing it to evolve alongside business needs. Huawei has proposed four principles to simplify the process of building and using ICT infrastructure: easy to integrate, access, use, and evolve. These facilitate the widespread use of ICT infrastructure in usual scenarios like campuses, WANs, and data centers, making it more accessible for various industries and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.\nAccelerating monetization refers to speeding up service innovation and value creation through digital and intelligent technologies, integrating technologies and scenarios, and collaborating to build a thriving partner ecosystem that supports continuous enterprise growth.\nHuawei is committed to innovation and developing a range of industry-specific solutions to meet customers’ requirements in different scenarios. These solutions are designed to assist customers in achieving their transformation step by step. During the summit, Huawei worked with partners to unveil digital and intelligent transformation solutions for ten industries, including National Government Cloud Solution, ICT Talent Cultivation Solution, Medical Technology Digitalization Solution 2.0, Digital CORE Solution, Smart Retail Solution, One-Cloud, One-Network, Multi-Hub Solution, Transportation Operations Coordination Center-Advanced (TOCC-A) Solution, Intelligent Distribution Solution, Unstaffed Open-Pit Mine Solution, and Intelligent Oil & Gas Field Solution. These solutions aim to help customers achieve greater success in the intelligent era.\nIn addition, Huawei is striving to streamline the popularization of ICT infrastructure and promote its adoption. With a focus on typical scenarios like campuses, WANs, and data centers, Huawei has released flagship products and portfolios and developed user-friendly HUAWEI eKit products.

When viewed superficially, it looks like a horror movie. But when we deeply delve into the plot and conversations, which happened at a very slow pace between the characters, we come to the conclusion that the red suitcase puller [Praveen Khatiwada] was, in fact, a hallucination of a pick-up van driver [Saugat Malla].\nOnly after the movie concludes do we realize that the seed of hallucination began to sprout in Malla’s mind soon after he loaded a coffin with the dead body of a Nepali migrant worker and the red suitcase of the deceased man into his van.\nIn a short scene, we can see a man in a blue jumpsuit with a red suitcase in his hand standing in a bus station. The video is shot in such a way that the viewer can assume he might have taken a vehicle passing by. By the middle of the movie, it becomes clear that he had climbed onto the van driven by Malla. That was Malla’s first hallucination.\nAs he was driving the van on the highway, he listened to a phone-in program on the radio, where he heard a man telling how he saw a mysterious man in a bus station, who vanished all of a sudden. That conversation in the phone-in program was another hallucination of Malla.\nSome people peeped inside his van, suggesting that someone else was there. But Malla didn’t bother to give a look. It is because that too was his hallucination.\nAs the night fell, he went to the hotel which lies by the side of the highway. That hotel happens to be owned by a retired army personnel [Bipin Karki] serving in the Indian army, who offered him liquor and food. The hotel and the host both were Malla’s hallucination. It becomes clearer when we analyze the conversation between Malla and Karki in the light of the happenings by the end of the movie.\nDuring the conversation, Malla said that after seeing the dead body of his teacher Mukti Nath Adhikari, who was murdered in a ruthless way by the Maoist guerrillas, he was deeply traumatized, and it changed the course of his life. He feels very sorry for those Nepali workers who died abroad. He has deep sympathy for the dead bodies. We can infer that such sympathy was a result of his trauma, which had left a deeper scar in his mind after seeing the dead body of his teacher.\nDuring the conversation, he says that he wishes no migrant workers die abroad. It means that he wants to correct their course by making them alive, at least in his imagination. That day too, he must have wanted the dead body inside the coffin to visit his house being alive, along with his red suitcase. Exactly the same scene is shown in the movie. It was another hallucination of Malla.\nDespite Karki’s plea for him to spend the night in his house, Malla insists on sleeping inside the van. By the end of the movie, it becomes clear that the house was abandoned and in a wrecked state. It was in no condition to accommodate him. We can assume that that’s why he slept in the van. Malla said to Karki that spending nights in the van had become his routine as he has to deliver about 20-25 dead bodies of the migrant workers to their relatives every month, and for this, he has to travel the highways almost on a daily basis. It does indicate that he had been hallucinating in a similar way in the past also. That night was just another hallucinating night for him.\nAs a driver with deep sympathy for the dead people who very frequently rides across the highways, it is highly likely that he must be aware of the retired army personnel who had committed suicide. He might have wished him to remain alive. That’s why he made him alive and had a conversation with him in a hallucinating state.\nAs the van reached its destination, Malla opened the coffin. Inside the coffin, there was a dead body wrapped in a blue jumpsuit. As Malla has been delivering dead bodies for a long time, he was aware that the bodies are wrapped in the blue jumpsuit. That’s why he hallucinated the dead body in the blue jumpsuit approaching his home by rolling his red suitcase to meet his dear ones.\nAfter he returns by delivering the dead body, a couple of scenes suggest that he believes in the ghosts. Firstly, he gets off from the van, plucks a branch of a thorny bush, and lays it on the road, suggesting that he believes it blocks the spirit of the dead body from approaching him. After a while, he goes to a river, washes the van, and lights a sacred flame to completely do away with the spirit. Only a person who believes in ghosts is more likely to hallucinate in that way.\nAll these events suggest that The Red Suitcase is a psychological thriller. When you watch the movie and come out of the theater, you will be carrying its deep effect in your mind, which will take at least some weeks to fade.","summary":"KATHMANDU: The Red Suitcase, a movie directed by Fidel Devkota, belongs to the psychological thriller genre.

Created by Vince Gilligan, the show follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer, and his former student, Jesse Pinkman, as they enter the dangerous world of drugs and crime. Methamphetamine is an amphetamine derivative, trade name Methedrine, used in the form of a crystalline hydrochloride; which is used as a stimulant to the nervous system and as an appetite suppressant.\nThe series is known for its gripping storyline, complex characters, and intense performances. Bryan Cranston portrays Walter White, a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who turns to cooking and selling methamphetamine after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. Aaron Paul plays Jesse Pinkman, a small-time methamphetamine manufacturer and dealer who becomes Walter’s business partner and surrogate son-like figure.\nThroughout the show, Walter and Jesse get involved with various criminal organizations and face numerous challenges as they try to establish their drug empire. The series explores themes of morality, the consequences of choices, and the transformation of its characters.\n“Breaking Bad” received critical acclaim and has been widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time. It won numerous awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards. The show also spawned a prequel spin-off called “Better Call Saul,” which focuses on the character Saul Goodman, who becomes the lawyer for Walter and Jesse in “Breaking Bad.”\nThe essence of the story:\nThe central theme of “Breaking Bad” revolves around the transformation of an ordinary man, Walter White, into a morally compromised and ruthless criminal. The series explores the consequences of Walter’s choices as he descends into the world of drugs and crime.\nOne of the primary themes is the concept of moral ambiguity. Walter starts as a sympathetic character driven by desperation to secure his family’s financial future after being diagnosed with cancer. However, as he becomes more deeply involved in the drug trade, his actions become increasingly questionable and morally reprehensible. The series challenges viewers to examine the boundaries of right and wrong and raises questions about the nature of human morality.\nAnother theme is the consequences of unchecked ambition and the allure of power. Walter’s initial motivations may be rooted in providing for his family, but his journey takes him on a path of power and control. As he gains more influence in the drug trade, he becomes consumed by his ego and the desire for dominance, leading to devastating consequences for those around him.\n“Breaking Bad” also delves into the concept of identity and self-discovery. Walter transforms from a meek and overlooked high school teacher into a notorious drug lord known as Heisenberg. Through this transformation, he explores his own capabilities and confronts his deepest fears and desires. The series highlights how our actions shape our identities and how the pursuit of power can corrupt and distort one’s sense of self.\nFurthermore, “Breaking Bad” touches on the theme of the destructive nature of secrets and lies. Walter’s double life strains his relationships with his family, friends, and associates. His web of lies and deceit creates an atmosphere of tension and paranoia, ultimately leading to devastating consequences for himself and those he cares about.\nThe themes of moral ambiguity, the consequences of ambition, identity, and the destructive power of secrets and lies are intricately woven throughout the narrative of “Breaking Bad.” The series challenges viewers to confront their own moral compass and consider the choices we make when faced with difficult circumstances.\nRiveting character transformation:\n“Breaking Bad” stands as a testament to the power of character transformation within the realm of television. At its core, the series captivates audiences with its exploration of the intricate metamorphosis of its protagonist, Walter White. The transformation of Walter from a meek, law-abiding chemistry teacher to a formidable drug lord named Heisenberg is a master class in character development, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of television storytelling.\nWalter White’s journey begins as a sympathetic figure; a man dealt a harsh blow by life’s circumstances. However, as the series unfolds, we witness a gradual erosion of his moral boundaries. It is this slow descent that makes his transformation all the more compelling. Breaking Bad challenges the viewers’ perceptions of good and evil, forcing them to confront the uncomfortable reality that anyone is capable of straying from the path of righteousness.\nAs Walter delves deeper into the methamphetamine trade, a new persona emerges – Heisenberg. This alter ego represents Walter’s liberation from societal constraints and an embodiment of his repressed desires. Heisenberg embodies power, control, and the audacity to defy conventional norms. Walter’s transformation into Heisenberg highlights the allure of dominance and the intoxicating effects of embracing one’s darker impulses.\nWalter’s transformation raises poignant ethical questions, forcing viewers to confront their own moral compass. Can a man driven by desperation be excused for his descent into criminality? Does the end ever justify the means? “Breaking Bad” navigates these dilemmas with finesse, presenting a complex protagonist whose actions blur the lines between hero and villain. The series challenges our preconceived notions of right and wrong, leaving us pondering the nature of morality long after the final credits roll.\nWhile Walter’s transformation grants him power and a taste of the life he had always desired, it comes at an enormous cost. The collateral damage caused by his choices weighs heavily on the narrative. Relationships fracture, lives are lost, and innocence is irreversibly corrupted. The series reinforces the notion that transformation often exacts a steep toll, underscoring the repercussions of unchecked ambition and the destructive ripple effect of one’s choices.\n“Breaking Bad” masterfully crafts an unforgettable character transformation that transcends the confines of traditional storytelling. Walter White’s evolution from a timid chemistry teacher to a morally compromised drug lord serves as a cautionary tale, provoking profound introspection among viewers. The series highlights the fluid nature of morality, the seduction of power, and the ramifications of embracing one’s darker instincts. Through the lens of Walter White’s journey, “Breaking Bad” has forever reshaped the landscape of character-driven narratives, leaving an indelible mark on the annals of television history.\nIntense storytelling:\nThe storytelling in “Breaking Bad” is undeniably intense and gripping. The series maintains a consistently high level of tension and suspense throughout its run, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. Here’s an exploration of the various elements that contribute to the intense storytelling of “Breaking Bad”:\nPacing: The show expertly balances slow-burning character development with heart-pounding moments of action. The pacing allows for a deep dive into the characters’ motivations and inner struggles, while also building anticipation for explosive confrontations and unexpected twists.\nCharacter-driven narrative: The intense storytelling stems from the compelling and complex characters at the core of the series.

The conflicts that arise between the characters drive the plot forward and create a palpable sense of tension.\nMoral ambiguity: “Breaking Bad” delves into the gray areas of morality, blurring the lines between right and wrong. This moral ambiguity adds an extra layer of intensity to the storytelling as viewers are constantly confronted with the characters’ questionable choices and the consequences that follow.\nHigh-stakes consequences: The decisions made by the characters in “Breaking Bad” often have life-and-death consequences. As the story progresses, the stakes escalate, and the characters find themselves entangled in dangerous situations, facing the risk of exposure, violence, and loss. This constant threat amplifies the intensity of the storytelling.\nEmotional depth: The emotional impact of “Breaking Bad” is a significant aspect of its intensity. The series explores themes of desperation, betrayal, guilt, and the consequences of one’s actions.

The attention to detail and the visual cues enhance the emotional impact and heighten the intensity of key moments.\nThe combination of these factors results in an intense storytelling experience that keeps viewers emotionally invested and engaged. “Breaking Bad” is renowned for its ability to create and sustain tension, leaving a lasting impression on its audience.\nLegacy and impact:\nBreaking Bad’s impact on popular culture cannot be overstated. It redefined the possibilities of storytelling on television, paving the way for a new era of complex and character-driven dramas. Its influence can be seen in subsequent series that embraced morally ambiguous protagonists and intricate narrative arcs.

Walter’s transformation into Heisenberg highlights the allure of dominance and the intoxicating effects of embracing one’s darker impulses.\nWalter’s transformation raises poignant ethical questions, forcing viewers to confront their own moral compass. Can a man driven by desperation be excused for his descent into criminality? Does the end ever justify the means? “Breaking Bad” navigates these dilemmas with finesse, presenting a complex protagonist whose actions blur the lines between hero and villain. The series challenges our preconceived notions of right and wrong, leaving us pondering the nature of morality long after the final credits roll.\nWhile Walter’s transformation grants him power and a taste of the life he had always desired, it comes at an enormous cost. The collateral damage caused by his choices weighs heavily on the narrative. Relationships fracture, lives are lost, and innocence is irreversibly corrupted. The series reinforces the notion that transformation often exacts a steep toll, underscoring the repercussions of unchecked ambition and the destructive ripple effect of one’s choices.\n“Breaking Bad” masterfully crafts an unforgettable character transformation that transcends the confines of traditional storytelling. Walter White’s evolution from a timid chemistry teacher to a morally compromised drug lord serves as a cautionary tale, provoking profound introspection among viewers. The series highlights the fluid nature of morality, the seduction of power, and the ramifications of embracing one’s darker instincts. Through the lens of Walter White’s journey, “Breaking Bad” has forever reshaped the landscape of character-driven narratives, leaving an indelible mark on the annals of television history.\nIntense storytelling:\nThe storytelling in “Breaking Bad” is undeniably intense and gripping.

It was planned during his prime ministership and Oli just formalised it through the agreement.“The framework is a cut and paste of the document finalised during my prime ministership,” Ganesh Shah, the party’s secretary, quoted Dahal as saying at the meeting. “Oli couldn’t make any breakthrough during the China visit.”No party leaders questioned Dahal’s statement.The leader of the opposition had made a similar claim while addressing the party’s mass meeting in his hometown of Chitwan on Tuesday. He had claimed that Oli had been circulating the photocopies of the agreement signed during Dahal’s China visit. Dahal last visited China in September last year. After multiple rounds of negotiations, Nepal and China on December 4 signed the 10-point framework for BRI cooperation, opening doors for Chinese funds for developing projects under the BRI. The funding modalities, however, will be negotiated for each project individually. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already made public the agreement undersigned by acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.Neither Dahal nor other party leaders, however, were critical of the agreement.

Dahal believes there will be some concrete progress in the merger by January 5. “In the central committee meeting, the chairman was to give a message that the party is consolidating its strength by uniting with Chand and others,” said a leader. There is a possibility that former vice-president Nanda Bahadur Pun will be given some party role—possibly vice-chair—at the upcoming central committee meeting. Pun, who has started attending the Maoist Centre’s office-bearer meetings, however, was absent from the Friday meeting.Talking to media after the meeting, Sapkota said the outcome of the recent local level bypolls has foiled the attempts of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to lead the country towards a two-party system. The Maoist Centre had won 11 out of 42 seats where the by-elections were held. Elated by the results, Dahal is preparing to present it as an indication of his party gaining ground and erosion of people’s trust towards the Congress and the UML, during the party’s central committee meeting. “The by-election results also indicate people’s increasing dissatisfaction and anger at the Congress-UML government,” said Sapkota, while making the meeting’s decisions public.In the meeting, the party leadership also decided to intervene in the leadership selection in its wing All Nepal National Independent Student Union (Revolutionary). Concluding that the union failed to hold its general convention, the party decided to pick the leadership while also imposing an age bar for student politics. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September.

The disputes in three places involve unregistered land while one is about private land.The railway track construction work from the Bagmati river in the east to the Dhansar river in the west is in the final stages. Although the construction company aims to complete the work by March 2025, the ongoing protests over land compensation pose a huge challenge.According to Kiran Karki, chief of Sarlahi office of Mechi-Mahakali Electric Railway Project, the local people obstructed the construction work near the Chandi stream, demanding compensation for the unregistered land that they have been using. “The residents do not have ownership documents. As per the existing legal provisions, compensation cannot be issued for unregistered land. The locals have been disrupting the construction work. And we are awaiting the directives of the centre on how to proceed,” said Karki.Although the government does not provide compensation for unregistered land, the residents have time and again obstructed construction work over the past two years. According to Karki, there is also a dispute regarding the unregistered land spreading in around 100 metres near the Lamaha stream. The protesting locals are hell-bent not to allow the contractor to carry out work until they are paid compensation. Saroj Chaudhary, a local in the Chandi area, says he would do all to obstruct the work “if the authorities attempted to make the agitating locals homeless.”“The government has to provide us compensation for the land that we have been using for years. Otherwise, we won’t let the project continue its work at any cost,” said Chaudhary.Similarly, construction of railway track has been stalled in the Santapur area after a landowner refused to receive the compensation stating that the amount offered was too low compared to the current market rates.The landowner said that the compensation amount set by the Compensation Fixation Committee is far less than the prevailing rates in the market. The committee has fixed the compensation amount ranging from Rs300,000 to Rs1.6 million per kattha [3,645 sq ft] of land.Construction of railway track is underway in Rautahat section under five different packages. Roshan Kumar Shrestha JV, Santoshi Construction, Lumbini Apex, Hindung Thokar and Golden Biruwa JV were awarded the contract in the Rautahat section. The contractor had to complete the project, which began in August 2019, by January 2022. But the track construction work has been delayed due to protests by the locals regarding the compensation amounts, the Covid pandemic, and bureaucratic hurdles in obtaining permission for felling trees in the forest area, among others.The landowners along the alignment of the planned East-West Electrical Railway at ward 8 of Chandrapur, Rautahat, had obstructed construction work over land compensation for months claiming they were not getting the reasonable price for their land. They had even attempted to attack the contractor and obstructed the work.The 945 km Mechi-Mahakali Electric Railway is one of the government’s national pride projects. A total of 22 km lies in Rautahat district.

Gurung (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) came to Kathmandu from Jhapa in January 2024 with the hope of a better income. But he faced months of difficulty finding a job.With the pressure of supporting his family and rent mounting, he was drawn to a sponsored Facebook post offering lucrative earnings for simple online tasks. “Earn up to Rs60,000 per month working from your phone,” the ad read.For Gurung, the promise of earning Rs60,000 a month by performing simple online tasks seemed too good to pass up.The Facebook ad led him to a Telegram group, where Gurung was welcomed by a ‘coordinator’ (fraudster posing as a Daraz subsidiary company’s coordinator) who explained the process. Tasks seemed simple enough: liking websites, subscribing to YouTube channels, and sharing promotional links. To start, however, Gurung had to deposit Rs5,000 as a ‘membership fee’.“At first, I was hesitant,” Gurung said, “but I thought, why not take a chance? They even paid me Rs1,000 after my first task, which made it seem legitimate.”Encouraged by the coordinator’s continuous lies that he would be paid double when completing higher tasks, Gurung deposited more money over the next month.In total, he invested Rs25,000—the amount he had saved for rent. The cycle abruptly ended when the coordinator asked him to recruit five new participants. Gurung was then blocked from the Telegram group.“I now feel ashamed,” Gurung said. “I trusted them because they paid me initially, but it was just a trap. My savings are gone… I don’t know what to do.”Gurung’s experience is far from unique. Employment fraud in Nepal is increasing, according to Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson and information officer for the Cyber Bureau.“These scams exploit trust and desperation. Victims are lured into schemes via platforms like Telegram, where fraudsters provide instructions for tasks that initially seem credible but eventually turn exploitative,” said Awasthi.Data from Nepal’s Cyber Bureau reveals a surge in cybercrimes, particularly electronic transaction frauds, over the past few years.In the fiscal year 2022-23, a total of 9,013 cybercrime cases were reported, with 1,835 related to electronic transaction fraud. By the following year, the number of cybercrime cases increased to 19,730 with electronic transaction fraud comprising 20.84 percent (4,112 cases) of the total, according to the bureau.This upward trend continues into the current fiscal year (2024-25), with 3,257 electronic transaction fraud cases already registered. Among these, the highest number of cases (1,186) fall under the category of ‘online job/loan’ or ‘employment fraud’ scams.The second most reported type involves ‘online shopping/online marketplace’ scams, with 1,027 cases. Additionally, 26 cases have been filed under ‘lure of foreign employment’, where victims were deceived online with false promises of overseas jobs.Aside from employment fraud, cyber scams range from e-commerce cheatings (where consumers pay but never receive goods), to phishing (impersonation of officials from some established companies like Daraz and eSewa), and even fraudulent flat rental listings.According to Awasthi, the total value of electronic transaction scams this fiscal year has reached Rs450 million. Even the report from the Financial Intelligence Unit-Nepal, ‘Cyber-Enabled Frauds under Strategic Analysis Report, 2024’ by Nepal Rastra Bank, indicated a sharp rise in fraud-related suspicious transactions in the first five months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.Fraudsters often use ads on social media platforms to lure victims into Telegram groups, according to Awasthi. There, victims like Gurung are assigned tasks that initially appear legitimate. To maintain credibility, scammers deposit small amounts of money into victims’ accounts for completed tasks.“It’s a calculated strategy,” Awasthi says. “Once trust is established, the fraudsters demand additional deposits under the guise of unlocking higher earnings. Eventually, the scammers disappear.”In some cases, victims are tricked into sharing their bank details with fake job listers or are tasked with making transactions between accounts as part of their ‘job’. These seemingly harmless tasks place the victims at the heart of illegal schemes, as the transactions occur under their names and accounts.In some instances, fraudsters entice victims with promises of small payments—like a monthly salary or a 2 percent commission—just to facilitate transactions through their bank or eSewa accounts.“Many victims are unaware that they are being drawn into fraudulent activities, and their accounts become conduits for illegal transactions,” said SP Awasthi. “When investigations unfold, these individuals find themselves already trapped in trouble, while the scammers disappear.”The Cyber Bureau understands the victims’ plight and does not penalise them, but Awasthi said that the growing volume of these cases is making it increasingly difficult to manage the situation. According to the bureau, Telegram is the primary platform used for electronic transaction fraud and scams. Investigating these cases proves challenging, as Telegram does not provide the necessary data to the Cyber Bureau.“Our only option is to trace the flow of money through bank records,” Awasthi said. “Often, when we contact the numbers traced from the bank, the calls go unanswered, or the numbers are no longer in use. It’s more complicated when the fraudsters operate from outside Nepal.”The digital landscape is expanding faster than public awareness of cybersecurity. For instance, according to a report by Nepal Rastra Bank, 70 percent of the individuals implicated in cyber-enabled fraud cases are aged between 19 and 30.These days several banks through their websites have been cautioning that it’s against the law to lend your account for others’ use or unauthorised purposes. Yet, people often fall into these traps. “While 4G has reached remote areas, awareness of internet risks hasn’t”, says Awasthi. He believes that technology should follow awareness, not the other way round. People are getting access to technology without understanding digital security, which is leading to an increase in cybercrimes and frauds. “The Cyber Bureau’s major role is to investigate crimes. While raising awareness is our concern too, we cannot do it all with limited resources… The government must seriously work to form a separate team or body to improve public awareness of these issues at the grassroots level”, adds Awasthi.","summary":"In October, 27-year-old Mandeep Gurung from Dhulikhel thought he had found a respite from his struggles. Gurung (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) came to Kathmandu from Jhapa in January 2024 with the hope of a better income. But he faced months of difficulty finding a job.With the pressure of supporting his family and rent mounting, he was drawn to a sponsored Facebook post offering lucrative earnings for simple online tasks. “Earn up to Rs60,000 per month working from your phone,” the ad read.For Gurung, the promise of earning Rs60,000 a month by performing simple online tasks seemed too good to pass up.The Facebook ad led him to a Telegram group, where Gurung was welcomed by a ‘coordinator’ (fraudster posing as a Daraz subsidiary company’s coordinator) who explained the process. Tasks seemed simple enough: liking websites, subscribing to YouTube channels, and sharing promotional links. To start, however, Gurung had to deposit Rs5,000 as a ‘membership fee’.“At first, I was hesitant,” Gurung said, “but I thought, why not take a chance? They even paid me Rs1,000 after my first task, which made it seem legitimate.”Encouraged by the coordinator’s continuous lies that he would be paid double when completing higher tasks, Gurung deposited more money over the next month.In total, he invested Rs25,000—the amount he had saved for rent. The cycle abruptly ended when the coordinator asked him to recruit five new participants. Gurung was then blocked from the Telegram group.“I now feel ashamed,” Gurung said. “I trusted them because they paid me initially, but it was just a trap. My savings are gone… I don’t know what to do.”Gurung’s experience is far from unique. Employment fraud in Nepal is increasing, according to Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson and information officer for the Cyber Bureau.“These scams exploit trust and desperation.

It is about the complicated lives of two brothers as they grieve the loss of their father from cancer. The story is based in Dublin and revolves around 32-year-old Peter Koubek and 22-year-old Ivan Koubek. Their parents live separately. The boys’ mother, Christine, lives with her boyfriend and children. Peter is a lawyer, whereas Ivan is a chess genius.These two brothers have a distant relationship, which further strains after their father’s death. Struggling to connect, they seek solace in romantic relationships. In the novel, we can see Ivan saying they were close when he was small. However, after he turns 16 and Peter breaks up with his high school girlfriend, Sylvia, he changes, and they grow apart. Ivan wishes for them to get back together as he thinks Sylvia has a good influence on him.Peter distracts himself with work, drugs, alcohol, and caring for two women: Sylvia, his high school girlfriend (now ex) and Naomi, a 23-year-old university student whom he is seeing at present. He had a great relationship with Sylvia, which took a turn after her accident and left her in chronic pain. For Peter’s sake, she broke up with him six years ago. But Peter isn’t over her. As he mourns his father, he also grieves for the life he and Sylvia could have had together, unable to give up their lost future. Sexual desire pushes Peter toward Naomi, who used to earn by selling her photos online. Their relationship is transactional and physical. The two women are aware of each other and have come to terms with it. Although Sylvia, now a professor of modern literature, and Peter are no longer together, they often share lunch and walk in familiar places. Peter, however, tries to keep his relationship with Naomi a secret. Sylvia is portrayed as Peter’s soulmate, someone he is comfortable and happy with, but their complicated relationship can’t work. On the other hand, while Peter cares for his girlfriend Naomi, he struggles to accept her publicly and feels guilt for being with her, as he is still not over Sylvia. Rooney also explores Peter’s mental turmoil, depicting his suicidal thoughts and reliance on drugs to sleep and escape from his real-life issues.Ivan, on the other hand, is shy and socially awkward. Once a chess prodigy who dominated major tournaments, he grapples with a career decline. He feels his career peaked during his teenage years, leaving him with little to look forward to. Despite holding a degree in theoretical physics, Ivan struggles financially, living in a shared apartment. He scrapes by with freelance data analysis work, which he detests, and spends his weekends participating in chess competitions and workshops.At a chess exhibition several hours outside Dublin, where Ivan impressively defeats ten opponents simultaneously, he meets Margaret, the event's programme director. Margaret, 14 years his senior and recently divorced from her alcoholic husband, captivates him. Their connection is born out of mutual loneliness, a rare moment where both feel seen. Despite their growing bond, the pair begin seeing each other secretly, as Margaret fears judgment from her family and friends regarding their significant age difference.At Sylvia's request, Peter invites Ivan to dinner, attempting to mend their strained relationship. During the meal, Peter tries to initiate conversations, but the evening turns tense when Ivan shares details about his new relationship with Margaret. Peter disapproves, questioning if Margaret is “normal” for dating someone so much younger and unemployed. His comments reveal his hypocrisy, as he is in a relationship with the much younger Naomi. Deeply offended, Ivan lashes out and storms out of the restaurant, shouting that he has hated Peter his entire life.As this is the first novel I’ve read by Rooney, I found her depiction of the complicated relationships between the characters compelling. The vulnerability and depth of emotions she portrays in the male characters were especially intriguing, leaving me curious about how relationships and male characters are explored in her other works.Rooney’s Irish references reveal her writing is deeply rooted in her country and culture. This book, however, demands a certain emotional readiness from its readers. It takes you through a journey of grief, pain, trauma, and tangled relationships, prompting deep reflections on life and personal connections. Yet, amidst this exploration of life’s darker moments, the book carries a message of resilience. It teaches us to embrace loss and pain, reminding us that life feels richest when we stop shielding ourselves from its realities. As she beautifully writes, “Everything exposed to light and air. Nothing protected, nothing left to be protected anymore.”The characters pose a question long after the final page: “What can life be made to accommodate, what can one life hold inside itself without breaking?” Rooney’s answer is both profound and hopeful—life, she suggests, is surprisingly vast. Like this novel, it can hold an incredible range of experiences—grief, joy, and everything.Rooney’s work consistently highlights that connections with friends, lovers, and even fleeting acquaintances are key to a meaningful life. We discover meaning through conversations, shared moments, and the stubborn pursuit of love. It’s not easy, and the characters often take unconventional paths to get there. But that’s what makes this story so relatable: the struggle, the search, and the eventual revelation that fulfilment, though elusive, is always worth chasing.Thus, ‘Intermezzo’ is a powerful exploration of love and loss. Although the first few chapters may feel confusing and lacking narrative flow, the book is worth reading. By the end, it’s not so much the plot that lingers in your mind but the characters’ emotional journey.IntermezzoAuthor: Sally RooneyYear: 2024Publisher: Faber & FaberPages: 454","summary":"‘Intermezzo’ is the fourth novel by Irish writer Sally Rooney.

Even though I couldn’t keep that promise, I tagged along with my father and his colleagues on a work trip to Dolpa. As we prepared for the journey, my father said, “I am taking you along only if you promise to stay awake the entire way and not fall asleep.”Our first stop was Chinchu, a junction point where the road splits: one leads to Kohalpur and the other northeast along the Bheri River. We continued northeast, and from that point, the glacial-fed Bheri River became our constant companion until we reached our destination, Dolpa. By the time we reached Jajarkot, it was already dark, but we could still see remnants of houses destroyed in the 6.4 magnitude earthquake of November 2023.Passengers ride atop a jeep on the rugged road leading to Dolpa. The following day, we reached the Jajarkot Durbar, now the District Administration Office. According to the locals, when Nepal was divided into the Baisey and Chaubisey Rajya, the red durbar was constructed before 1800 BS by King Hari Shah, the 14th King of Jajarkot. Later, in 1852, the 16th King of Jajarkot, Indra Narayan Shah, built the white durbar. These durbars were constructed by the locals of Jajarkot, who laboured free of charge.After a quick lunch at Tallobagar, we continued on our journey. The day was short, but the night stretched endlessly before us. We planned to reach Dunai, the municipality of Dolpa, early enough to enjoy the scenic view, but the bumpy road ahead made it impossible.The Bheri River and the Tripurakot village as seen from the Tripura Sundari temple. A little ahead, we crossed a bridge that collapsed two years ago, killing four people. Once across, we began the five-hour bumpy ride to Dunai. The walls had political slogans, and nearly every house displayed flags of political parties that they were affiliated with. Almost peculiar for us was the sight of women whose heads were covered with a red turban, under which money was tucked. When we asked her about it, she explained that she had just returned from her maternal home after Bhai tika, and the money tucked into her turban was given to her by her brother. “It is our tradition,” one of them said.After two hours of driving, we reached Triveni, the confluence point of three districts: Rukum, Dolpa, and Jajarkot. We reached Dunai at 7 pm.Landscape view of Tripura Sundari. My father woke me up at 5 am to prepare for our next destination, the Tripura Sundari temple. The route to the temple was a memorable one. The gurgling Bheri River looked beautiful in its deep blue hue, contrasted beautifully with the surrounding brown hills.The temple’s red, blue, and yellow fluttering flags, visible from the road, invited us to the temple. Located at an elevation ranging from 2,000 meters to 5,000 meters, the temple is situated near Tripurakot on the bank of the Thuli Bheri River. According to legends from the Shri Swasthani, the temple was named Tripura Sundari because a demon Tripura was killed there. It is also believed that Sati Devi’s torso fell at this spot, making it sacred.Seto Durbar in Jajarkot, currently serving as the District Administration Office, is undergoing construction. Recounting the mythology of the temple’s history, one of the priests, Laxmi Kanta Upadhayaya from the temple, said King Bikram Sahi had built the Tripura Kot fort in the 7th century. The rice milling machine of the fort would yield eight maanas of rice while milling four. Even the chaff from milling would turn into rice. After excavating where the rice mill was kept, a copper vessel was uncovered, with a pan of ghee placed above it and, above the pan, a copper plate. On top of the plate was a Sastkona Yantra (a mystical six-pointed diagram), and inside the layers, butterflies representing the nine forms of goddess Navadurga Bhawani were discovered.The road to Triveni passes alongside a cliff.  Just after that, the leader of the excavation, Kaji, fainted and began to speak, as I was told, under the influence of the goddess’s divine power, where he said, “We are the nine sisters, Bhagwati. As butterfly-formed goddesses, we have flown and settled in various places. Among us are Bageshwari of Banke, Kanika Sundari of Jumla, Khairabang Devi of Salyan, Ganasaini Tripureshwari of Baitadi, and Badimalika of Bajura. The remaining four sister goddesses, Bala, Tripura, and Sundari, reside in Tripura Sundari of Dolpa.”After receiving blessings, we were on our way back to Kathmandu via the Madhya Paschim Highway. We reached West Rukum at night, and the following day, on our way to East Rukum, we stopped the car to take photos of the stunning landscape of West Rukum. Surrounded by the towering hills of East Rukum, the vastness before me had flat areas with sloped land for growing crops. The land was dotted with patches of green and sparsely distributed houses with colourful roofs that made the place look spectacular.The snake hill on the road leading to Dunai.  After descending, we drove towards Baglung. The landscape shifted, with dense forests of coniferous trees carpeting the hills. The trees stood at the hills in a pattern reminiscent of a traditional Nepali carpet. In this way, travelling through three provinces–Karnali, Lumbini, and Gandaki, and covering nearly seven districts, we concluded our trip in five days.The road leading to the Tripura Sundari temple. The faces of Tripurakot. A herd of goats seen on the way to Dolpa.","summary":"After my first trek to Langtang last year, I promised to trek to a new destination every year. Even though I couldn’t keep that promise, I tagged along with my father and his colleagues on a work trip to Dolpa. As we prepared for the journey, my father said, “I am taking you along only if you promise to stay awake the entire way and not fall asleep.”Our first stop was Chinchu, a junction point where the road splits: one leads to Kohalpur and the other northeast along the Bheri River. We continued northeast, and from that point, the glacial-fed Bheri River became our constant companion until we reached our destination, Dolpa. By the time we reached Jajarkot, it was already dark, but we could still see remnants of houses destroyed in the 6.4 magnitude earthquake of November 2023.Passengers ride atop a jeep on the rugged road leading to Dolpa. The following day, we reached the Jajarkot Durbar, now the District Administration Office. According to the locals, when Nepal was divided into the Baisey and Chaubisey Rajya, the red durbar was constructed before 1800 BS by King Hari Shah, the 14th King of Jajarkot. Later, in 1852, the 16th King of Jajarkot, Indra Narayan Shah, built the white durbar. These durbars were constructed by the locals of Jajarkot, who laboured free of charge.After a quick lunch at Tallobagar, we continued on our journey. The day was short, but the night stretched endlessly before us. We planned to reach Dunai, the municipality of Dolpa, early enough to enjoy the scenic view, but the bumpy road ahead made it impossible.The Bheri River and the Tripurakot village as seen from the Tripura Sundari temple. A little ahead, we crossed a bridge that collapsed two years ago, killing four people.

The accused include Shambhu Prasad Rauniyar, the cooperative’s chairperson of Dhanpalthan-4; Vice Chairperson Laxman Sah of Katahari Rural Municipality-2; Secretary Alam Ansari Miya of Dhanpalthan-4; and Treasurer Shambhu Prasad Singh, also of Dhanpalthan-4. Additionally, board members Amod Mandal of Jahada Rural Municipality-4, Roshan Rajbanshi of Dhanpalthan-4, and Jitman Thakur of Dhanpalthan-2 have been charged. Audit committee coordinator Vijay Kumar Yadav, along with members Surendra Kumar Rajbanshi and Ashok Kumar Bishwas, are also named as defendants under Section 122 of the Cooperative Act, 2017. Koirala, a former board member, resigned on January 19, 2022, following a financial crisis in the cooperative. A teacher by profession, she had been listed as a member when the cooperative approved microfinance loans.

Doctors found her oxygen level had dropped to 40, a critical stage in which a patient needs supplemental oxygen via a tube and mask.“The patient was brought in a critical condition. She was suffering from asthma,” said Dr Dirgha Singh Bam, a senior chest physician who is also a former secretary at the Ministry of Health. “Pollution from the road and the flyover construction site not only made her sick but is also harming younger members of her family and others in the area.”Air quality is once again worsening in the Kathmandu Valley and other places. Experts say the burning of stubble and agricultural waste, along with dust from roads and construction sites are the main culprits. Besides these, polluted air from India could be equally responsible, according to them.“Whatever the causes, toxic air is taking a huge toll on public health, and the agencies concerned are doing little to address it,” said Dr Bam. “Every year during the dry season, air quality plummets to hazardous levels, but we have stopped complaining about it. Also, we have stopped expecting accountability from the agencies concerned.”On Wednesday, air quality in the Kathmandu Valley worsened to unhealthy levels. According to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air-quality data from around the world, Kathmandu ranked as the sixth most-polluted city in the world with PM2.5 levels reaching 189 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) on Wednesday morning.Meghauli of Chitwan recorded even higher levels at 207 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3), which is considered ‘very unhealthy’. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and even the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and are also likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.As per the Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index, it is considered unhealthy when air quality reaches 151–200, everyone may experience problems, with sensitive groups feeling more severe effects.Although air quality declines during winter and dry seasons are common, experts criticise the inaction of the agencies responsible for addressing the problem. They say polluted air affects not only the elderly people and those already suffering from respiratory illnesses, but also young people and children.“Unless the public starts holding the responsible agencies accountable, this problem will remain,” said Dr Arjun Karki, chief consultant and head of pulmonary critical care at Hams Hospital. “Many sensitive issues that affect everyone are overshadowed by less-important political issues. Media, too, are busy diverting public attention to trivial matters.”Construction activities, especially those involving roads and sidewalks, are major sources of dust pollution. Most of these projects start only after the dry season begins, and are left incomplete for a long time. Contractors dig up roads without any urgency to meet deadlines.“A lack of coordination between the agencies concerned makes matters worse,” said Bam. “There are dozens of examples of projects not being completed on time, and people are left to bear the brunt of the authorities’ negligence—whether it is the Butwal-Narayanghat road construction project or other smaller projects. I have advised some patients to move to less polluted areas.”Doctors say the deterioration of air quality seriously affects public health. According to them, poor air quality causes both short- and long-term effects on public health. Bad air quality can cause pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke and heart problems, among others, in the short term, and ulcers and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease and heart problems in the long run.Studies show that polluted air has been shortening the lives of Nepali people. Polluted air has been cutting short the lives of Nepali people by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) that converts air pollution concentration into impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively.Meanwhile, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which has been cleaning roads and pavements using water tankers and broomers, said its efforts seem ineffective as vehicles coming from other local units of the Valley constantly bring in dirt and dust.“Within a few hours of washing, roads and pavements get dusty again,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department at the city office. “We have been using six water tankers to wash roads and pavements, but the dust problem has not lessened. Dust from other parts of the Ring Road has also contributed to the pollution.”Officials at the Department of the Environment said that reducing worsening air pollution is impossible without proper coordination among all agencies concerned and the general public.“Local governments have a key role in curbing pollution. They should prevent open burning of waste materials, make contractors complete work on time, and enforce other measures as and when needed,” said Deepak Gyawali, the department's information officer. .","summary":"A few days ago, a 65-year-old woman from Gwarko, Lalitpur, where a flyover is under construction, was rushed to a private clinic as she complained of shortness of breath and dizziness.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle.

Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors.  Sangam Prasain/TKPWe spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century.  Sangam Prasain/TKPBefore we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside.  Sangam Prasain/TKPOn the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.  Sangam Prasain/TKPOn our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top.  Sangam Prasain/TKPA short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century.  Sangam Prasain/TKPIn the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka.  Sangam Prasain/TKPJetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.  Sangam Prasain/TKPSri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations.  Sangam Prasain/TKPThe return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.","summary":"We spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park  ShutterstockBardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park  ShutterstockKhaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley  Post File PhotoLimi Valley in Humla district of Karnali province serves as an ideal destination for those seeking stunning natural landscapes.

It resides alongside the remnants of the disk of dense gas and dust circling the host star - called a protoplanetary disk - that provided the ingredients for the planet to form.The star it orbits is expected to become a stellar type called an orange dwarf, less hot and less massive than our sun.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. The statue of Juddha Shumsher’s mother Juhar Kumari Devi inside the Central Zoo, Jawalakhel.  Photo: Courtesy of Central ZooSeeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved.

Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden.

An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall.
