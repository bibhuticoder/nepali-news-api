I would also like to reaffirm Nepal’s full support as you undertake the important responsibilities entrusted to you.\nWe extend our deepest appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis, the outgoing President, for his commendable leadership in successfully guiding the 78th Session of the Assembly.\nOur highest accolades are due to the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for his tireless dedication to reinforcing multilateralism in tackling global challenges. \nI fondly recall your visit to Nepal last year, Mr. Secretary-General, and your message of peace from the sacred birthplace of Gautam Buddha, and the message of climate catastrophe of mountains from the Everest region. \nMr. President,\nThe world is at a watershed moment in history. \nThe contrast between rich and poor, harmony and hatred, and economic development and environmental destruction have never been as stark as they are today.\nBoth people and planet stand on the brink of climate catastrophe.\nGeopolitical rivalries are resurging. \nMilitary expenditures are skyrocketing along with an unabetted arms race. \nThe spectre of nuclear conflict looms larger than ever before.\nOn one hand, our economy remains frail, still grappling with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other, nationalism and protectionism have re-emerged, even before we have reaped the benefits that liberalisation and globalisation were meant to deliver. \nEven after three hundred years of industrialization and modernization journey, it is deeply troubling that in our so-called civilized world of 21st century, wealth and prosperity are concentrated mostly at the hand of Global North and the poverty and destitution are heavily concentrated in the Global South, particularly in the least developed countries (LDCs). \nTo overcome these travesties, we must demonstrate our leadership that promotes meaningful cooperation and collaboration. \nIt is only through collective will and unified action that we can turn the tide and usher in an era of enduring peace and shared prosperity for all.\nIn this context, the theme of this Session “Leaving No One Behind: Acting Together for the Advancement of Peace, Sustainable Development and Human Dignity for Present and Future Generations,” could not be more timely or relevant.\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment through the ‘Summit of the Future’ to build a safe, just, and sustainable world for both present and future generations.  \nThis pledge is embodied in the three pivotal documents we have adopted: Pact of the Future, Declaration on Future Generation, and the Global Digital Compact. \nWe must demonstrate our determination to implement these documents for the wellbeing of present and future generations.  \nMr. President,\nAllow me to underline that the principle of ‘Leaving No One Behind’ has long been the cornerstone of Nepal’s approach to development across all sectors.\nThis philosophy is enshrined in our Constitution which upholds the values of democracy by guaranteeing inclusivity, equality, justice, proportional representation, human rights, and social protection for the most vulnerable sections of society.\nI am determined to lead my country with my deep conviction to ‘comprehensive democracy’. \nFor me, comprehensive democracy ensures equal rights, equal access to opportunities, social justice, protects the vulnerable communities, and provides the security and dignity for all individuals. \nDemocracy goes far beyond the right of the people to choose their leaders. It is about leading the people towards prosperity and happiness so that they could feel highest level of dignity. \nAt the international level, sovereign equality and mutual respect constitute the bedrock of comprehensive democracy. \nThese principles are essential for building the frameworks of a just, inclusive, equitable, representative, and accountable global order. \nMr. President,\nAs a nation emerging from conflict, Nepal deeply understands the profound value of peace and political stability. \nSince the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, Nepal has been firmly focused on completing the peace process at the earliest. \nImmediately after the formation of my government, parliament passed a Transitional Justice bill to settle transitional justice issue once and for all. \nWhile we implement the law, we will uphold victims’ rights, including truth and justice. \nWe will also use reparations and reconciliation to heal the wounds and scars of conflict period. We appreciate support from international community including the UN system in this regard. \nThe present government, formed by the collaboration of our two major political parties, is determined to secure stability while driving economic transformation for the inclusive and equitable prosperity to our people. \nAt this juncture, stability and economic transformation are paramount to us than our periodic competition in elections. \nWe have dedicated ourselves to realizing our national aspiration: ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.’\nNepal will be graduating from its LDC status by 2026. We are diligently working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and aspire to become a developed country by 2043, despite facing significant economic headwinds. \nHowever, our path to achieving the SDGs remains fraught with difficulties. We are confronted with a substantial financial gap of about 24 billion US dollars to attain the 2030 Agenda. \nIn this backdrop, Nepal hosted the IDA 21 replenishment meeting last June, underscoring the crucial need for continued and enhanced support from the International Development Association along with other development partners. \nIn this pursuit, we strongly reiterate our call for enhanced, predictable, and sustained international support. \nMr. President,\nClimate change has emerged as the gravest threat to our planet, people, and prosperity. \nMy own country, Nepal, is particularly hard hit. We stand as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change and are ranked as the 20th most disaster-prone country in the world.\nOf utmost concern is the alarming rate at which the pristine Himalayas, often referred to as the Third Pole, are losing their vast snow reserves. \nThis loss threatens water availability for billions of people living downstream, extending far beyond the borders of my country.\nNepal has hugely been contributing to the health of our planet through its forests, mountains and rivers. \nYet, despite these efforts, we continue to bear the brunt of climate change. In this context, we call for climate justice. \nOur mountains play a crucial role in regulating the climate and ecosystem of oceans, with their snow-fed rivers flowing down to the oceans. \nNepal’s Himalayas, as a natural climate stabiliser, help maintain a cooling system in a region situated in the hottest zone of the planet between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\nGiven their significance, it is essential that the mountain agenda should receive due attention in climate negotiations. \nNepal is steadfast in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and aims to achieve net zero target by 2045, five year earlier than global target. \nAs climate change is a global challenge, it demands global action and collaborative efforts to address its widespread and cascading impacts.\nAdequate climate financing including ‘Loss and Damage’ fund is crucial to support climate-resilient measures and infrastructure for adaptation in developing countries not least in LDCs. \nMr. President,\nNepal’s land is blessed with the wisdom of enlightened great sages from both the Hindu and Buddhist faith, particularly the teachings of Gautam Buddha. \nThis profound legacy has shaped our world view to seek global harmony, peace, and security.\nThe values of love, harmony, tolerance, and empathy as espoused by Gautam Buddha, hold even greater relevance today than they did over two thousand five hundred years ago.\nBut, to our deep dismay, the world is increasingly distressed by division, suspicion, hatred, and enmity. \nNepal firmly believes that dialogue and diplomacy are the sole means to resolve conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East. It is through love and compassion that hostility and hatred can be overcome, paving the way for lasting peace.\nOn the issue of Israel-Palestine conflict, we continue to support a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist peacefully and securely within internationally recognised borders, in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.\nWe must address the worsening humanitarian crises in regions such as Libya, Syria, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, and elsewhere.\nIt is vital to uphold the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference as enshrined in the UN Charter to ensure peace and stability. Consequently, we staunchly oppose any form of unilateral intervention or sanctions.\nMr. President,\nDisarmament and non-proliferation issues must be prioritised. \nNepal strongly advocates for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. As the host country to the UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal firmly believes that regional efforts, including the Kathmandu Process, serve to strengthen the global disarmament regime. \nTechnology presents a double-edged sword, especially for the Least Developed Countries. \nIf we harness it, we can make remarkable progress. If we fail, it will leave us further behind. We call for technology transfer to enable us to catch up. \nMr. President,\nNepal has always adhered to a peaceful, independent, balanced, and non-aligned foreign policy, based on the principles of Panchsheel, the UN Charter, international law, and norms of world peace.\nWe conduct our foreign policy with profound belief in ‘Amity with All, Enmity with None.’\nNepal remains committed to further strengthening its close, cordial, and constructive relations with its immediate neighbours and beyond, rooted in the principles of mutual respect, sovereign equality, territorial integrity, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, and peaceful co-existence.\nAs the largest contributor of troops and police to UN Peace operations, Nepal stands ready to further enhance its contribution to global peace and security.\nNepal believes it is our rightful call for having commensurate representation in the leadership positions, both at the UN headquarters and in the field, reflecting our significant contribution.\nMr. President,\nNepal firmly advocates for the reform of the UN System to make it more effective, democratic, transparent, and accountable.\nWe firmly believe that stronger multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, is the only path forward to tackle the numerous global crises we face.\nWe echo a call for substantial reform of the global financial system, as aptly described it by Secretary-General Mr. António Guterres as “morally bankrupt.”  \nThe voice and representation of countries in special situations including the LDCs, Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must be ensured. \nMr. President,\nNepal firmly upholds the belief that all human rights are universal, inalienable, indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated. \nIt is with this conviction that we have become a party to twenty-four international human rights-related conventions and protocols, including seven of the nine core instruments.\nWe are fully committed to promoting gender equality and ensuring equal rights for women. Nepal is making necessary legal arrangements for the full realisation of all human rights for women and girls including their sexual and reproductive health rights.\nProtection of the rights of migrant workers including their safety, security, dignity, and wellbeing, has always remained our priority.\nWe strongly advocate for safe, orderly, and regular migration to ensure that the benefits of migration are shared by all.\nFinally, Mr. President,\nThe world we inhabit is far from being perfect.\nYet, it is not all doom and gloom. We firmly believe that humankind is still capable enough to march ahead without compromising the prosperity and happiness of future generations.\nNone of the global challenges we are facing today have been imposed by aliens.  These are our own makings. Our own creations. \nTherefore, it is self-evident that by fostering global understanding, trust and cooperation, we can overcome these problems and challenges.  \nA just, inclusive, and equitable world order as well as sustained prosperity are attainable when we collaborate effectively. \nLet me resonate the wisdom of our ancient text, the ‘Maha Upanishad’ from around the sixth century BC, 'Vasudhaiva kutumbakam’: meaning ‘the whole world is one family.’\nWe not only hold this philosophy dearly, but we also act it on our everyday life. \nWith this constant conviction, Nepal is committed to playing its role to secure our shared aspiration of enduring peace, progress, and prosperity while leaving no one behind.\nThank you. \n","summary":"\n     The full text of statement delivered by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli at the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is as follows:Mr. President,\nYour Excellencies the Heads of State and Government,\nMr. Secretary General,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen. \nI stand here as a humble representative of thirty million proud Nepali people.\nAt the very outset, allow me to extend my sincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, and distinguished members of the Bureau on your well-deserved elections.

He said the Ministry was ready to manage the market for its productions.\nThe Health Minister viewed that the foreign imported Ayurvedic medicines could be displaced by making arrangements for the sale and distribution of the domestically-manufactured Ayurvedic medicines at all the local levels throughout the country.\n\"The Vaidyakhana should enhance its capacity not only to become self-sufficient but also for export purpose. If the production is increased, we will put a halt on their import,\" he added.\nStating that there is no option for the Vaidyakhana other than to earn by increasing its production, Minister Paudel believed that the financial condition of the entity would improve if its income was guaranteed. \n\"The government will support and coordinate in selling the medicines if the Committee took initiatives for improving its financial status by increasing the production. The Committee's works would be continued through this initiative and at the same time it will be easier for the government to provide remuneration and facilities to the employees,\" he said and added that it would not be comfortable for the government to continue with an entity that is always operating in loss.\nThe Health Minister sought the support and cooperation of all the stakeholders in addressing the problem.

He said the Ministry was ready to manage the market for its productions.\nThe Health Minister viewed that the foreign imported Ayurvedic medicines could be displaced by making arrangements for the sale and distribution of the domestically-manufactured Ayurvedic medicines at all the local levels throughout the country.\n\"The Vaidyakhana should enhance its capacity not only to become self-sufficient but also for export purpose. If the production is increased, we will put a halt on their import,\" he added.\nStating that there is no option for the Vaidyakhana other than to earn by increasing its production, Minister Paudel believed that the financial condition of the entity would improve if its income was guaranteed. \n\"The government will support and coordinate in selling the medicines if the Committee took initiatives for improving its financial status by increasing the production. The Committee's works would be continued through this initiative and at the same time it will be easier for the government to provide remuneration and facilities to the employees,\" he said and added that it would not be comfortable for the government to continue with an entity that is always operating in loss.\nThe Health Minister sought the support and cooperation of all the stakeholders in addressing the problem. He said the Vaidyakhana carried special significance in terms of its uniqueness, legacy and identity. \n \"Vaidyakhana is an institution that is run according to Nepal's traditional system. Along with our tradition, spirituality and history are also connected with it. This is our culture and tradition. The Samiti's production is on a decreasing trend these days. If a condition comes in which the Vaidyakhana itself has to be closed down, then our unique identity will also be collapsed,\" he added. \nHouse of Representatives, Public Account Committee president Santosh Chalise expressed his commitment to make initiatives for managing the budget required for upgrading of the Vaidyakhana. \nFormer Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of Nepal Maharshi Foundation, Deepak Prakash Baskota said that they would increase the medicine production from Vaidyakhana enough for export as well provided that the government created the environment for the same. \nHealth Secretary Dr Roshan Pokharel said the Ministry was positive if the Vaidyakhana wanted to advance ahead assessing its capacity.  \nDr Shyam Babu Yadav, president of Nepal Ayurveda Medical Association, called attention of the Ministry towards increasing the capacity of Vaidyakhana.\nCommittee Chairperson Prof Dr Thakur Prasad Duwadi also called attention of the Ministry towards making the Vaidyakhana self-reliant and financially strong. \nOn the occasion, Minister Paudel and the distinguished guests released the 10th edition of Chandra Nighantu, a compendium on Ayurvedic medicine. \nVaudyakhana was established during the reign of King Pratap Malla and was housed at Hanumandhoka. Later it was shifted to Thapathali Durbar and to Singha Durbar. It was converted into the status of a Development Committee in 2052 BS.\n---\n"},{"hash":"be372ca1df174f50ae2859a92319e88dde1404cca137888f2bf179979216eec4","title":"three-types-of-dengue-viruses-active-in-nepal","date":1730160000000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/health/three-types-of-dengue-viruses-active-in-nepal","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/kushtia_dengue_6yr_old_child_dies_of_dengue_in_kushtia_daily_bangladesh_16941828191697183214_1024.jpg","category":"health","content":"\n    KATHMANDU: The Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases Control Division has confirmed that three types of dengue viruses -- serotype-1, serotype-2 and serotype-3 -- are active in Nepal.Chief of the Division's Vector Borne Disease Control Section Dr Gokarna Prasad Dahal confirmed that DV-1, -2, and -3 were reported in the country.\n\"In the past, serotype-1, serotype-2, serotype-3 and serotype-4 were active.

As per the story that RSS disseminated, Chief at the District Health Office, Angad Bahadur Shahi, said it was not clear whether the girl was immunized against Japanese encephalitis.\nSimilarly, in the major streets of the federal capital itself, notices like 'Here, we fill up forms for visa application', 'Visit us for filling up forms for PSC exam', 'We prepare police reports here' etc are common sights. \nThese two references are just representative stories that are directly linked to the national ambition of 'Digital Nepal'. In the first case, the story showed there was no information/data at the hospital or health facility to ascertain if the girl was immunized, which the government provides before 23 months of one's birth, while the second story shows filling up forms for government services are mediated, but the service seekers themselves are not able to access the service on their own.\nWith the computerized system, people are freed from hand-written forms and waiting in lines for a long time to submit application forms. But, the dearth of digital literacy among the public is reflected well in it. The first story of the unavailability of the girl child's record on her health status signals equally poor data/information management at government offices.\nThe references seem marginal, but they are strong reminders of the current state in the campaign of transforming Nepal into the 'digital Nepal'. \nAs was the case some years back that witnessed huge demand and debate on 'smart city', even the leaders in economic sectors, including line ministers are saying that a time has come for Nepal as well to undergo a structural transformation of the national economy, but they fall short to explain how digital economy could play an integral role in this drive. \nOnce the local levels got the people's representatives for the first time since the enforcement of the current constitution, there was frenzy that 'smart city' could be ensured with the internet access. The debate fizzled out once they became aware that only internet expansion was not enough to set up the smart city. However, there is no denying that internet connection has increased significantly with gradual improvement in quality in Nepal. \nAlthough the internet is a prerequisite for digital transformation, there is much more to do to fully realize the transformation and achieve the ambition of Digital Nepal. The full realization of digital transformation does not leave anyone behind in the journey. Luxury of select people, society, professions, and classes who can afford better than a large number of people is not a transformation, but a blatant reflection of deepening inequality and the widening digital divide.\nOf course, there are many services Nepalis can receive digitally at present. There is a vibrant presence of people in the digital spheres expressing views and keeping close tab on public officials and agencies; media have gone digital; digital entertainment is on the rise; early warnings of weather change and its effects are issued. The drive of a paperless service is also gaining a pace. Even transportation is linked to the digital sphere thanks to ride-hailing services. \nBan on TikTok lifted\nIt is worth noting that the present government has earned accolade by lifting ban on TikTok, one of the most popular social media in Nepal. After lifting the ban, the government hailed the role of social media on promotion of freedom of expression. The TikTok, however, saw the ban for 10 months in the name of 'disrupting social harmony'.  \nDespite this, we have no luxury of being happy over this achievement when we set the ambition of digital Nepal. The ambition needs to be all-encompassing that everyone from the poor, marginalized, and backward communities should be beneficiaries of the digital movements and campaigns. \nWe are in an inclusive and participatory system gained after struggles that lambasted the previous system for not addressing the diverse issues, opinions, demands and needs. It should in need be a lesson for us to pay heed to the needy ones as we negotiate the digital world.\nEncompass multiple fronts \nThe smooth and effective digital functioning in the fronts of economy, society, education, bureaucracy, politics, law and judiciary, parliament, health and agriculture can help materialize the Digital Nepal. Once the law and policymaking are delayed, the pace of digitalization is evidently slowed. It is worrying that the laws on information technology, cybercrime and cybersecurity are still awaited much in Nepal, while the wave of artificial intelligence is already engulfing the entire globe. \nSimilarly, flawless and frictionless flow of information/data along with interoperability in place paves way for the digital economy that links the cross-border business in the present globalized and hyper-connected context. However, security of data must be taken into account. Within the country, we have three tiers of government that can work in utmost collaboration to avoid duplications of digital campaigns and software developments. \nDigital transformation must not be limited to facilitating digital activities but also creating a digital economy. For it to happen, multi-layer governments, economic experts, tech giants, tech entrepreneurs, regulatory bodies and policymakers need to come together and mull how Nepal can create a digital economy that guarantees benefits to all.\nAs digital issues evolve continuously, the initiatives on it warrant timely and collaborative approaches rather than cut-throat competition among governments. Utilization of available tech experts within country can unburden governments from the hefty financial costs of digital investment.\nSimilarly, from agriculture to education and health to disaster, connection and engagement with digital spheres are imperative, thereby encompassing people from all sides, sectors and classes. \nTo conclude, how can citizens access to their information/data available at government offices? Are people's data available with governments, and are they safe? What efforts are needed to raise our current status of digital convenience to the digital economy? Have digital conveniences so far contributed to digital transformation? Are our digital initiatives ensuring digital dividends equally to all or abetting the digital divide? Questions are pressing and need proper addresses.\n","summary":"\n    Narayan Prasad Ghimire/RSS\nKathmandu, Sept 12: A recent news story from Banke district stated that a girl child contracted Japanese encephalitis, but it was not sure whether she was immunized against the life-threatening disease earlier. \nThere is a government provision that children from 12 to 23 months since birth are administered the vaccine against this virus, but the data/information was not available.

The first story of the unavailability of the girl child's record on her health status signals equally poor data/information management at government offices.\nThe references seem marginal, but they are strong reminders of the current state in the campaign of transforming Nepal into the 'digital Nepal'. \nAs was the case some years back that witnessed huge demand and debate on 'smart city', even the leaders in economic sectors, including line ministers are saying that a time has come for Nepal as well to undergo a structural transformation of the national economy, but they fall short to explain how digital economy could play an integral role in this drive. \nOnce the local levels got the people's representatives for the first time since the enforcement of the current constitution, there was frenzy that 'smart city' could be ensured with the internet access. The debate fizzled out once they became aware that only internet expansion was not enough to set up the smart city. However, there is no denying that internet connection has increased significantly with gradual improvement in quality in Nepal. \nAlthough the internet is a prerequisite for digital transformation, there is much more to do to fully realize the transformation and achieve the ambition of Digital Nepal. The full realization of digital transformation does not leave anyone behind in the journey. Luxury of select people, society, professions, and classes who can afford better than a large number of people is not a transformation, but a blatant reflection of deepening inequality and the widening digital divide.\nOf course, there are many services Nepalis can receive digitally at present. There is a vibrant presence of people in the digital spheres expressing views and keeping close tab on public officials and agencies; media have gone digital; digital entertainment is on the rise; early warnings of weather change and its effects are issued. The drive of a paperless service is also gaining a pace. Even transportation is linked to the digital sphere thanks to ride-hailing services. \nBan on TikTok lifted\nIt is worth noting that the present government has earned accolade by lifting ban on TikTok, one of the most popular social media in Nepal. After lifting the ban, the government hailed the role of social media on promotion of freedom of expression. The TikTok, however, saw the ban for 10 months in the name of 'disrupting social harmony'.  \nDespite this, we have no luxury of being happy over this achievement when we set the ambition of digital Nepal. The ambition needs to be all-encompassing that everyone from the poor, marginalized, and backward communities should be beneficiaries of the digital movements and campaigns. \nWe are in an inclusive and participatory system gained after struggles that lambasted the previous system for not addressing the diverse issues, opinions, demands and needs. It should in need be a lesson for us to pay heed to the needy ones as we negotiate the digital world.\nEncompass multiple fronts \nThe smooth and effective digital functioning in the fronts of economy, society, education, bureaucracy, politics, law and judiciary, parliament, health and agriculture can help materialize the Digital Nepal. Once the law and policymaking are delayed, the pace of digitalization is evidently slowed. It is worrying that the laws on information technology, cybercrime and cybersecurity are still awaited much in Nepal, while the wave of artificial intelligence is already engulfing the entire globe. \nSimilarly, flawless and frictionless flow of information/data along with interoperability in place paves way for the digital economy that links the cross-border business in the present globalized and hyper-connected context. However, security of data must be taken into account. Within the country, we have three tiers of government that can work in utmost collaboration to avoid duplications of digital campaigns and software developments. \nDigital transformation must not be limited to facilitating digital activities but also creating a digital economy. For it to happen, multi-layer governments, economic experts, tech giants, tech entrepreneurs, regulatory bodies and policymakers need to come together and mull how Nepal can create a digital economy that guarantees benefits to all.\nAs digital issues evolve continuously, the initiatives on it warrant timely and collaborative approaches rather than cut-throat competition among governments. Utilization of available tech experts within country can unburden governments from the hefty financial costs of digital investment.\nSimilarly, from agriculture to education and health to disaster, connection and engagement with digital spheres are imperative, thereby encompassing people from all sides, sectors and classes. \nTo conclude, how can citizens access to their information/data available at government offices? Are people's data available with governments, and are they safe? What efforts are needed to raise our current status of digital convenience to the digital economy? Have digital conveniences so far contributed to digital transformation? Are our digital initiatives ensuring digital dividends equally to all or abetting the digital divide? Questions are pressing and need proper addresses.\n"},{"hash":"f7eafd779c8e1b0bda553726555e8d9547f47854f7c2e42a6308a9103a0913ff","title":"nepal-southern-agriculture-science-and-technology-park-inaugurated","date":1730658794532,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/nepal-southern-agriculture-science-and-technology-park-inaugurated","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/renu_dahal1724809543_1024.jpg","category":"science-and-technology","content":"\n

There is a dire need to ramp up efforts to get it on track. But then we as a country are taking a step back when the rest of the world is looking to boost tourism with robust plans and policies. The Civil Aviation Authority’s latest decision to close Tribhuvan International Airport—Nepal’s only ariel gateway for foreign tourists and the sole door of opportunities for millions of its citizens—for 10 hours (10 pm to 8 am) to complete a long-overdue taxiway expansion, has garnered national and international criticism for the strain it will put on the country’s tourism.While there is nothing wrong with the project to renovate taxiways that have worn out from years of use, the authorities perhaps didn’t consider its impact on tourism and passengers seriously. The airport closure from November 8 to March 31 is bound to inconvenience foreign visitors as it coincides with both autumn and spring peak trekking seasons. Festivals, family reunions, holidays and favourable weather make this season the perfect time to travel to Nepal. Such a prolonged halt will only dampen people’s enthusiasm. One is left wondering why such a vital time was chosen for these renovations.The financial repercussions are substantial. The Nepal Tourism Board, which had aimed for 1.3 million tourists this year, has cut down the expected number to 1.1 million. This could lead to a revenue loss of around Rs50 billion for the airline and tourism industry. Indirect cost could be many times higher. International airlines have cut flights or cancelled tickets at short notice, taking airfares to all-time highs. For instance, the most popular destination in November, Sydney, which would have cost Rs85,000 on normal days, will now cost Rs217,000 (for the highest priced tickets) and Rs114,000 (lowest). For average Nepali workers and students, these fares are unaffordable. Tourism entrepreneurs are facing losses as hotels are reporting cancellations.In 2019, for the same project, the airport was closed for seven hours (11:30 pm to 6:30 am) after which 24/7 operations began for the first time to compensate for the lost flight hours. Earlier this year, too, for the very project, landings from the northern side of the airport were barred, but there were no airport closures. Given these precedents, one would have expected more robust planning this time. Instead, it seems there has not been enough homework. The civil aviation authorities’ efforts to manage the Kathmandu airport’s congestion by redirecting traffic to Pokhara and Gautam Buddha international airports have also failed because no foreign airline operator is willing to fly to these destinations. Travel trade entrepreneurs lament that this “unplanned construction” is taking too long and fear it might extend to spring, another peak tourist season. This is understandable given Nepal’s poor record in completing roads and infrastructure. They have also urged the authorities to limit the shutdown to five hours. However, that risks further delaying the project. A balanced approach that prioritises tourism and passengers while ensuring timely completion is the best. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) request that the authorities shorten the closure or spare high-traffic days is logical. Halting operations at peak arrival and departure is neither wise nor sustainable. Ultimately, the health of the country’s civil aviation is closely linked to the state of its regulator. Right now, it appears that our top aviation officials are working more for themselves than for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries.  "},{"hash":"2db6e200a5fb884ecd9afe24087dd0488874c240d7ea38164a883ddfd66a5f7f","title":"on-university-presses","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/11/01/on-university-presses","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/leadshutterstock1-1730402055.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1730419200000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Nepali universities do not own and run academic presses, which are units that commission and publish academic works in the form of books and journals. Today, I am only concerned about books published by such entities.Nepal’s oldest university, Tribhuvan University (TU), does own a printing press. Started most likely in the early 1970s, it was then called University Press and has now become Tribhuvan University Press. While this entity might be necessary to print TU stationery such as the question papers for the many exams it conducts each year, I am not referring to such a physical press. Instead, I am talking about a proper publishing unit that solicits and commissions academic books and manages their peer-review process. Regarding manuscripts accepted for publication, the unit will also handle the copy-editing, layout and proofreading to see the book through to final production. In other words, I am looking for publishing units with imprints that might have names like Tribhuvan University Press, Kathmandu University Press and Pokhara University Press.University presses elsewhereThe university presses that mostly publish academic works (although increasingly also some general interest books) have existed in Europe and North America for a while. Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press were established in the 16th century and are associated with the two eponymous British Universities. Some of the oldest university presses in the US such as the Johns Hopkins University Press and the University of Chicago Press are more than 120 years old. There are similar university presses in continental Europe, like Amsterdam University Press, and in Australia, like Melbourne University Publishing. Closer to our country, there are university presses in Japan (Kyoto University Press), Singapore (National University of Singapore Press) and Thailand (Chulalongkorn University Press). India does not have a strong tradition of such presses. The new Ashoka University has entered into a co-publishing arrangement with the publisher Permanent Black to put out books under the “Hedgehog & Fox” series. Most of the university presses do not make a profit. They serve the public via the production of academic texts. Their business operations are subsidised for the most part by their mother universities or subventions from third parties. In the US, these third parties have included the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Their daily operations are managed by professionals with diverse experience in publishing. Each unit is usually supervised by a committee of academics from inside and outside the associated university. The Association of University Presses has more than 160 members from different countries. The American university press system was professionalised two decades after World War II. Since then, as former director of the University of Michigan Press Phil Pochoda explained in a 2012 article, the American university presses have provided a very important service for the larger academic community. As “superior teaching, institutional service, and professional reputation were no longer sufficient for moving into and up the faculty ranks,” the quality “of publication became … the primary qualification for faculty appointment” and promotion. Pochoda continued: “If administrations were to require published books as a major part of a decision on faculty tenure or promotion, then it was necessary for the books to arrive at that decision point already professionally authorised… (by) credentialed external reviewers.” Since there are only about 100 plus university presses in America and about 4,000 higher education institutions, Pochada suggested that these university “presses … are in fact subsidising… other universities and colleges.” Even as many features of the print-based American university press system of the previous century have been undone by the ongoing digital transitions in scholarly publishing, it still retains a solid role in the higher education landscape of the US.Possible hereNepal had a late start in academic publishing. When the print-based university press system was being fully finalised in America during the 1960s, Nepal’s oldest university, TU, had just started publishing scholarly resources such as the Journal of the Tribhuvan University (established 1964). Its departments and research centres started putting out their own publications in the 1970s. Even as publications by faculty members became important for their recruitment and promotion in the later decades, no decisions seem to have taken place regarding the starting of a publishing imprint inside TU. Triratna Manandhar, a former professor of history who taught at TU for about 40 years (from 1967 onwards) and served as humanities and social science dean for eight years, does not recall any conversation on this subject. Historian Bhaveswar Pangeni, who has written a book on the institutional history of TU and has done extensive research on the archives of the minutes of TU’s executive council, does not recall seeing a record of any related discussion. In its initial years, one can make the excuse that TU’s collective research community was a small one and hence something like TU Press was not viable. Given the significant increase in the number of researchers who work for TU and elsewhere, this excuse does not hold for the post-1990 period.The situation is not much different in our newer universities. Kathmandu University is now 30 plus years old and employs dozens of fine researchers in many different disciplines. In a functional university that exercises a good degree of autonomy and holds international aspirations, it is surprising that something like a Kathmandu University Press does not exist already. However, the former dean of its School of Arts, Sagar Raj Sharma, has told me that conversations around such an idea have been ongoing for a while. Everything done by Western universities need not be copied by Nepali universities. However, since universities are perceived to be the most legitimate source of knowledge production and distribution, starting university presses in our country would be a good idea. The truth is that a few academics in each of our universities who care about good scholarship could put together publishing programmes if they got their act together. Such an initiative will of course require the blessings of our university leaders, investments on interested people and some infusion of money. Faculty members could be provided incentives to take up publishing-related positions for three or more years. The needed money can be earmarked in funds made available to universities by the University Grants Commission or third parties. Academics working in research institutions inside and outside of Nepal with substantial publishing experiences could be recruited to serve as members of the supervisory boards.Some folks think that the era of printed books is already over. I don’t think that is the case. Print runs of recent academic books published in Nepal are larger than those in neighbouring India for a reason. The books still sell in Nepal. Hence, Nepali university presses should put out some great academic books—monographs reporting new research or those that synthesise the most recent knowledge on any given subject, edited volumes of new writings, or readers of old writings—desired by academics, students and members of the public. The collaborative work needed to run university presses might even ameliorate the deleterious effects of bhagbanda spoils in our universities.

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of protesters descended on Bangladesh’s capital city, Dhaka. The crowds ransacked her official residence, occupied the nation’s parliament and burnt down her family home.Hasina, who had ruled the country for more than 20 years in total, had been widely accused of turning autocratic and clamping down severely on any opposition to her rule.For many, the Bangladesh revolution offers hope in the context of growing global authoritarianism. It illustrates the power of the youth to confront entrenched leaders, and the fragility of authoritarianism. It also highlights a striking feature of contemporary global politics: how central capital cities are to the political life of nations.In our new book, Controlling the Capital: Political Dominance in the Urbanizing World, a diverse range of scholars argue that capital cities are crucial political sites. They’re where governing elites seek to assert and maintain political control, and they are also stages for political contestation.The book is focused on sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the two fastest-urbanising regions of the world.Authors explore the strategies and tactics used by ruling elites to politically dominate their capital cities in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The authors also consider how urban populations have engaged with these efforts. People may resist authority, but they can also cooperate with it in ways that benefit themselves—which sometimes reinforces or supports authoritarian control.This is increasingly important in the context of two contemporary trends. First, authoritarianism is growing globally. Just 10 years ago under half of the world’s population lived under authoritarian rule; now the figure is at 71 percent. The second trend is the ongoing rapid urbanisation of the world’s population, with the majority of us globally now living in urban areas.Urban unrestOver the past year we’ve seen how capital cities are spaces for contestation.Some pro-democracy movements draw from their own histories of struggle and the paths that have been carved by those before them. The template of Bangladesh’s 2024 revolution is ingrained in politics from the ways in which liberation was fought and how later struggles against authoritarian rule were won. The capital city has also been crucial, and students at Dhaka University were key mobilisers in such movements.In other contexts, the link between political resistance and urban areas is a relatively new and surprising route to political change. One example is “the struggle” seen in Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo and the unseating of the Rajapaksa family, who were perceived as increasingly authoritarian rulers of the country. The Colombo chapter in this volume highlights how such protests emerged in a context where urban unrest had rarely threatened those in power before.Even where anti-authoritarian protests have proved futile time and again, urban populations rarely remain quiet.In Kampala, Uganda, demonstrations prior to the 2021 elections resulted in a horrifying government crackdown. Inspired by events in neighbouring Kenya, protesters took to the streets once more in July 2024 to demonstrate against corruption.The protests that erupted in Nairobi from late June 2024 against tax rises engulfed the capital city. They continued for some time, fuelled by the brutal police response. Similarly, Nigeria’s 2020 #EndSARS protests against police brutality created a powerful movement in cities such as Abuja and Lagos which shook government, and resonated across much of the continent.In an age of social media, learning and mimicry across national borders is increasingly common. One of the defining images of Kenya’s 2024 urban uprising was of a group of men with their arms raised and crossed at the wrists—a gesture of anti-authoritarian protest that gained particular resonance several years back during neighbouring Ethiopia’s own uprising.As urban protest seems set to continue and spread—often taking intentionally similar forms—techniques of urban authoritarian control are more varied and complex.Strategies to dominate and control city populations can be dramatic and repressive—such as the brute force of police violence—and they can also be subtle, deeply ingrained, and sometimes difficult to discern.Authoritarian tacticsOur book argues that authoritarian leaders are increasingly aware of the power of the urban masses. As a result, they are using a range of subtle, and not-so-subtle, tactics to entrench their domination in capital cities.We broadly described two types of interventions that elites use.The first are policies and favours that actively build support among urban groups. These can range from inclusion in political parties to investments in social provisions or infrastructure to win support. The book’s chapter on Addis Ababa shows how the latter were particularly striking under the previous governing regime in Ethiopia.The second are repressive interventions that aim to crush opposition. These are also diverse, and include violent crackdowns, but also surveillance and intimidation.In practice, the two types of interventions often overlap. The line also blurs through various forms of manipulation. For instance, misinformation or the delivery of goods in exchange for performances of political loyalty, underpinned by implicit threats of coercion.We also highlight the significance of urban geography.Ruling elites often seek to divide city populations (for example inner-city dwellers versus the peripheries). This is evident in our book’s chapter on Colombo, Sri Lanka. The Rajapaksas tried to consolidate power by appealing to the new middle class suburbanites through “beautification” projects. But these displaced and excluded the inner-city poor.Chapters on Harare and Kampala also show how particular peripheral areas have become central to efforts to build an urban support base by Zanu-PF and the National Resistance Movement. This often plays out through the informal parcelling out of land to supporters.Contesting autocratic ruleConcerns about authoritarian politics are at an all-time high.Meanwhile, the contestation of autocratic rule will continue to erupt in cities, especially in rapidly urbanising parts of the world. In this context, the need to understand how autocracy and urbanisation collide could hardly be more important.If pro-democracy forces are to have any hope of prevailing against efforts by authoritarian ruling elites to entrench their position, there is a crucial need to better understand their urban strategies and tactics.

Inspired by events in neighbouring Kenya, protesters took to the streets once more in July 2024 to demonstrate against corruption.The protests that erupted in Nairobi from late June 2024 against tax rises engulfed the capital city. They continued for some time, fuelled by the brutal police response. Similarly, Nigeria’s 2020 #EndSARS protests against police brutality created a powerful movement in cities such as Abuja and Lagos which shook government, and resonated across much of the continent.In an age of social media, learning and mimicry across national borders is increasingly common. One of the defining images of Kenya’s 2024 urban uprising was of a group of men with their arms raised and crossed at the wrists—a gesture of anti-authoritarian protest that gained particular resonance several years back during neighbouring Ethiopia’s own uprising.As urban protest seems set to continue and spread—often taking intentionally similar forms—techniques of urban authoritarian control are more varied and complex.Strategies to dominate and control city populations can be dramatic and repressive—such as the brute force of police violence—and they can also be subtle, deeply ingrained, and sometimes difficult to discern.Authoritarian tacticsOur book argues that authoritarian leaders are increasingly aware of the power of the urban masses. As a result, they are using a range of subtle, and not-so-subtle, tactics to entrench their domination in capital cities.We broadly described two types of interventions that elites use.The first are policies and favours that actively build support among urban groups. These can range from inclusion in political parties to investments in social provisions or infrastructure to win support. The book’s chapter on Addis Ababa shows how the latter were particularly striking under the previous governing regime in Ethiopia.The second are repressive interventions that aim to crush opposition. These are also diverse, and include violent crackdowns, but also surveillance and intimidation.In practice, the two types of interventions often overlap. The line also blurs through various forms of manipulation. For instance, misinformation or the delivery of goods in exchange for performances of political loyalty, underpinned by implicit threats of coercion.We also highlight the significance of urban geography.Ruling elites often seek to divide city populations (for example inner-city dwellers versus the peripheries). This is evident in our book’s chapter on Colombo, Sri Lanka. The Rajapaksas tried to consolidate power by appealing to the new middle class suburbanites through “beautification” projects. But these displaced and excluded the inner-city poor.Chapters on Harare and Kampala also show how particular peripheral areas have become central to efforts to build an urban support base by Zanu-PF and the National Resistance Movement. This often plays out through the informal parcelling out of land to supporters.Contesting autocratic ruleConcerns about authoritarian politics are at an all-time high.Meanwhile, the contestation of autocratic rule will continue to erupt in cities, especially in rapidly urbanising parts of the world. In this context, the need to understand how autocracy and urbanisation collide could hardly be more important.If pro-democracy forces are to have any hope of prevailing against efforts by authoritarian ruling elites to entrench their position, there is a crucial need to better understand their urban strategies and tactics.

This has been Nepal’s chronic problem mainly after the 1990 political change: Nepali authorities have turned several entities built by or with the support of foreign donors into non-functioning bodies. The latest victim of neglect is the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border railway. India’s Konkan Railways Corporation Limited (KRCL) has been helping Nepal operate the railway by providing its staffers to run trains along the route. The Indian Railway Construction International Limited had built the section and handed it over to the Nepal Railway Company Limited in June last year. Erstwhile prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi jointly flagged off the railway, which is considered a milestone in cross-border connectivity between the two countries.As Nepal’s only railway company had no trained staff to run the trains, the Indian company, KRCL, agreed to provide the human resources until the Nepali side had necessary staff, including technicians. The Indian company was also ready to train Nepalis. For that, all the Nepali side needed to do was select people and send them for training across the border. But Nepali authorities failed to do even that bare minimum. Eventually, the Indian company wrote to the Nepali side asking either to renew the contract that expires in December or terminate it. As Nepali authorities are still unprepared to run the train, they are planning to extend the contract with the KRCL for another year. The Indian company provides 28 railway technicians, including engine drivers, whom the local railway administration has been paying hefty amounts in salaries and perks.

If the country continues to be neglectful of the support of its foreign friends, not only will it reflect poorly on Nepal’s standing as a trusted partner. It will also show that the country is uninterested in learning from its friends abroad and in time developing its own capabilities to run vital projects and ventures.

He has vowed to try to revive cheap Russian gas supplies and said he would meet with President Vladimir Putin if Moldovans wanted it.The outcome of the vote is likely to set the tone for next summer’s parliamentary elections where Sandu’s ruling party is expected to struggle to retain its majority and which will determine the stripe of the future government.Stoianoglo’s East-West balancing rhetoric contrasts with Sandu’s four years in power, during which ties with the Kremlin have unravelled, a slew of Moscow’s diplomats have been expelled and she has condemned Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine.Moscow has said that her government is “Russophobic”.Sandu portrays Stoianoglo as the Kremlin’s man and a political Trojan horse, painting Sunday’s vote as a choice between a bright future in the EU by 2030 and one of uncertainty and instability.Stoianoglo says that is untrue and that she has failed to look out for the interests of ordinary Moldovans. He accuses Sandu of divisive politics in a country that has a Romanian-speaking majority and large Russian-speaking minority.Fresh meddling allegationsThe police have cracked down to try to avoid a repeat of what they said was a vast vote-buying scheme deployed by Russian-backed fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor in the first round and a referendum on the EU’s aspirations on Oct. 20.Russia denies interfering, while Shor has denied wrongdoing. He lives in Russia and has openly called on people via social media to vote against Sandu and promised payment for following his instructions.Sandu has said the meddling affected the Oct. 20 results and that Shor sought to buy the votes of 300,000 people, more than 10% of the population.A Moldovan government source said Chisinau had notified several EU nations that it believed Russia would try to disrupt voting by Moldovan expatriates on Sunday at polling stations in their countries.The source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters polling stations in Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Canada, Romania, United States and Britain might be targeted by disruption including with the use of bomb hoaxes.Moldovan voters living in the West are seen as largely pro-European and therefore more likely to support Sandu, who has championed Moldova’s effort to join the 27-nation bloc by 2030.The referendum result went to the wire, delivering a slender win of 50.35% for the pro-EU camp.Sandu won 42% of the vote in the first round, falling short of the 50% needed to win outright. Stoianoglo came second with 26%.Stoianoglo is expected to benefit from protest votes against Sandu’s handling of the economy in the poor agricultural nation of fewer than 3 million people.Moldova struggled with the aftermath of the COVID pandemic and the effects of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of neighboring Ukraine. That sparked a huge influx of refugees and sharply reduced Russian gas supplies, causing high inflation.Ahead of the vote, Sandu campaigned with the slogan “Save Moldova”.

It’s not easily digested. But we didn’t play our best cricket and we accept that. New Zealand played better than us throughout.“There were a lot of mistakes that we made, we accept it ... As a captain, I wasn’t at my best leading the team and with the bat as well.”New Zealand resumed their second innings on 171-9 earlier, but India needed only 14 balls to bowl the Black Caps out, as Jadeja had Patel caught in the deep to end with 5-55, after bagging five in the first stanza.

We’re just a bunch of Kiwis taking on the world.”The tourists won the opening match in Bengaluru by eight wickets for their first test victory in India in 36 years, and wrapped up the series in Pune with a 113-run win.New Zealand’s maiden series triumph in India going back to 1955 also snapped the hosts’ home streak of 18 straight series triumphs since a 2-1 loss to England in 2012.Sharma threw the first punch by stepping out of his crease to hit Matt Henry for a four in the opening over of the day, but the skipper’s disappointing recent run of form continued as he fell for 11 after a rash shot against the same bowler.Patel made it two wickets in two overs as Shubman Gill, who had scored a splendid 90 in the first innings, left a ball that crashed into the stumps and departed for one.Virat Kohli did not last long after arriving at the crease as he edged Patel back to slip on one to leave India in trouble at 18-3 on a tricky Wankhede Stadium pitch.The crowd fell silent again as Yashasvi Jaiswal was trapped lbw for five by Glenn Phillips and Sarfaraz Khan hit a full toss from Patel straight to Rachin Ravindra in the deep on one.Ravindra Jadeja steadied the ship alongside Pant in a 42-run stand, but a stunning catch by Will Young meant India were on the ropes at 71-6.Patel dismissed Pant following a New Zealand review after lunch, although the batsman appeared to suggest that he had not made contact with the ball before it was caught.The runs dried up after that and India collapsed in a heap with Washington Sundar the last to go while looking to go big.“Losing a series, losing a test match is never easy. It’s not easily digested. But we didn’t play our best cricket and we accept that. New Zealand played better than us throughout.“There were a lot of mistakes that we made, we accept it ... As a captain, I wasn’t at my best leading the team and with the bat as well.”New Zealand resumed their second innings on 171-9 earlier, but India needed only 14 balls to bowl the Black Caps out, as Jadeja had Patel caught in the deep to end with 5-55, after bagging five in the first stanza.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) announced that the Montreal Convention liability limits for death, injury, delays, baggage, and cargo issues will increase on December 28, 2024. Nepal implemented the Montreal Convention for the first time on December 15, 2018. Millions of air passengers worldwide are entitled to compensation for yearly flight delays, cancellations, and overbooking. Because passengers are unaware of their rights and airlines make it so hard to get their money, less than 2 percent receive their flight compensation, according to a study. Here is what you need to know about the Montreal Convention and your air passenger rights. Claim what you owe.What is the Montreal Convention 1999 or MC99?The Montreal Convention is a multilateral treaty adopted by a diplomatic meeting of International Civil Aviation Organisation member states in 1999. Ratified in 1999 and enacted in 2003, the Montreal Convention was a successor to the Warsaw Convention 1929.Formally known as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, the Montreal Convention 1999 (or MC99) has established a comprehensive and unified framework for the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air. It introduced several elements to balance the interests of travellers, cargo shippers, and the aviation industry. The Convention sets liability limits for airlines, ensuring fair compensation for consumers in cases of injury, death, delay, baggage and cargo issues. ICAO has informed the 140 State Parties that the limits will increase in line with the Convention’s built-in review mechanism, which adjusts for inflation every five years. This ensures that passenger and cargo compensation remains appropriate over time. This is the fourth review since the treaty came into force in 2003. \"ICAO continues to advocate for the universal ratification of MC99,\" said Juan Carlos Salazar, the ICAO secretary general, in a statement. \"This Convention is fundamental in protecting consumer interests in international air travel. By promoting harmonisation and codification of rules governing international carriage by air, MC99 benefits passengers and cargo shippers while enabling the unified and equitable development of air services.\"What are the liability provisions?The liability limits are indicated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a unit of account defined by the International Monetary Fund. For indicative purposes, 1 SDR has been valued at US$ 1.33318 on October 18, 2024. What are the revisions? The limits will be revised as follows: 1. The death or bodily injury limit will increase from 128,821 SDRs to 151,880 SDRs (about US$202,500). It originally was 100,000 SDRs in 2003. 2. The limit for passenger transport delays will rise from 5,346 SDRs to 6,303 SDRs (about US$8,400). 3. The limit for baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay will increase from 1,288 SDRs to 1,519 SDRs (about US$2,000). 4. The limit for cargo destruction, loss, damage, or delay will rise from 22 SDRs to 26 SDRs per kilogram (about US$35). ICAO has invited the States Parties to MC99 to make provisions as necessary in accordance with their domestic legal requirements, to give full effect to the revised limits as of December 28, 2024.What’s the case of Nepal?The Montreal Convention allows air passengers on international flights to claim compensation for damages caused by travel disruptions and luggage problems. Since travellers in Nepal are not aware that they can file a compensation claim, many passengers protest at the airport against the delays, cancellations, baggage damages and other issues caused by the airlines' negligence. For example, if the passengers' baggage is damaged, under the rule, passengers can claim up to $2,000 with the particular airline.However, the Montreal Convention waives the airline’s liability in cases where extraordinary circumstances caused the flight disruption. Such cases include adverse weather, Air Traffic congestion and restrictions, lightning strikes, bird strikes, strikes at the airport, medical emergencies, security threats, and political unrest, etc. You can also claim when … ?On November 30 last year, Flight RA229 of the state-owned Nepal Airlines flew two hours before its scheduled departure, leaving 31 passengers stranded at midnight at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. The reason for the rushed departure was the flight’s VVIP status. Then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was on the same flight. The flight was planned for Dahal, who left for Dubai leading the Nepali delegation to the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28). According to experts, the case is severe negligence by the airline company, and passengers can still file compensation cases as per the Convention.The MC99 extends a time frame within which a passenger can claim compensation for damages – up to two years following the occurrence of the flight disruption. If the claim pertains to damaged, lost, or delayed luggage, it's imperative to report the issue expeditiously. Claims for damaged baggage should be filed within seven days, while claims for delayed baggage must be initiated within 21 days. If your bags remain unclaimed for more than 21 days and are considered lost, you still can file a claim within two years.Where to file the claims?According to Vijay Shrestha, vice-president of administration at Himalaya Airlines, passengers can file a compensation claim by filling out a “property irregularity form” at the airline office or the airline’s ground handling agent in any destination airport.Luggage will be categorised as lost if the airline cannot trace it for 21 days from filing the property irregularity report. All claims shall be substantiated with an itemised list of contents, description, age, and proof of purchase or ownership of all items. At Kathmandu airport, passengers can file compensation claims for loss, delay, or damage at the lost and found unit of Nepal Airlines. “The compensation provision used to be printed on tickets, but since airlines issue e-tickets nowadays, passengers can go to the ‘contract of carriage by air’ on the airline's website to know the information regarding the loss, delay, or damage,” said Shrestha. Is MC99 applicable to domestic airlines? The MC99 makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury.A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparations for adopting a similar law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill for domestic airlines has been sent to the finance ministries for their comments before being tabled by the Cabinet. After the Cabinet nod, the bill will be tabled in Parliament.What’s the provision in the proposed domestic law? As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.

The flight was planned for Dahal, who left for Dubai leading the Nepali delegation to the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28). According to experts, the case is severe negligence by the airline company, and passengers can still file compensation cases as per the Convention.The MC99 extends a time frame within which a passenger can claim compensation for damages – up to two years following the occurrence of the flight disruption. If the claim pertains to damaged, lost, or delayed luggage, it's imperative to report the issue expeditiously. Claims for damaged baggage should be filed within seven days, while claims for delayed baggage must be initiated within 21 days. If your bags remain unclaimed for more than 21 days and are considered lost, you still can file a claim within two years.Where to file the claims?According to Vijay Shrestha, vice-president of administration at Himalaya Airlines, passengers can file a compensation claim by filling out a “property irregularity form” at the airline office or the airline’s ground handling agent in any destination airport.Luggage will be categorised as lost if the airline cannot trace it for 21 days from filing the property irregularity report. All claims shall be substantiated with an itemised list of contents, description, age, and proof of purchase or ownership of all items. At Kathmandu airport, passengers can file compensation claims for loss, delay, or damage at the lost and found unit of Nepal Airlines. “The compensation provision used to be printed on tickets, but since airlines issue e-tickets nowadays, passengers can go to the ‘contract of carriage by air’ on the airline's website to know the information regarding the loss, delay, or damage,” said Shrestha. Is MC99 applicable to domestic airlines? The MC99 makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury.A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparations for adopting a similar law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill for domestic airlines has been sent to the finance ministries for their comments before being tabled by the Cabinet. After the Cabinet nod, the bill will be tabled in Parliament.What’s the provision in the proposed domestic law? As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.

Amid the festive atmosphere, Matrika Bhandari sat on the terrace with his five-year-old son, Soham. Soham tugged at his father’s sleeve, eager to show him the kites his cousins were flying outside.However, Bhandari’s attention was elsewhere—he was engrossed in his phone, scrolling through TikTok videos.After several failed attempts to get his father’s attention, Soham gave up. He wandered over to a corner of the room, found his tablet, and started playing a game. Later that evening, during dinner, Bhandari complained to his relatives, “I just don’t know what to do with Soham. Children of today can’t live without phones… He’s always glued to his tablet!”Ironically, as he voiced this concern, he was checking a WhatsApp message on his phone. What Bhandari failed to notice was the reflection of his habits in his son’s growing attachment to screens.It’s the time of festivals again, and familiar scenes of families and relatives coming together are playing out. Yet another common sight will be children and teenagers huddled in the living room, their heads bowed over their phones. Conversations will often start with parents and relatives lamenting that children have become ‘addicted’ to their phones—a topic that is sure to come up at almost every Nepali family gathering this festive season.However, what often goes unnoticed is that in many such living room gatherings, it’s not only the younger generation immersed in screens; their parents are just as preoccupied.It’s common to see parents handing their phones to children to keep them entertained or distracted while they focus on work, or playing videos like ‘Baby Shark’ during mealtime to help their kids eat. And the parents are busy with social media.Research says parents’ excessive use of phones influences their children’s screen habits—and this link is often overlooked.This isn’t without consequences. A study published in PubMed found that greater child and parental exposure to electronic media was linked to a smaller expressive vocabulary at age 2 and negatively impacted language development by age 5. Another study involving parents of 421 Estonian children between the ages of 2.5 and 4 years old revealed that parents who spent more time on screens had children who also used screens more frequently. These children exhibited poorer skills in grammar and vocabulary. The study, which was published in the journal ‘Frontiers’, emphasises the importance of parent-child verbal interactions in language development.Consider Dipika Jha from Maitighar, Kathmandu, a mother who once enjoyed imaginative tea parties with her daughter Kenjal. By the time Kenjal turned four, Dipika’s attention had shifted to her phone during their playtime. As Dipika scrolled through her social media feeds, Kenjal’s attempts to engage her mother grew increasingly desperate. Over time, Kenjal stopped trying and became increasingly silent. It was only a year later through Kenjal’s teacher that Dipika realised that her emotional absence was stunting Kenjal’s emotional development.Kenjal has begun to mimic her mother’s detachment. This lack of parental engagement was diminishing her ability to express emotions and build meaningful relationships.Research supports this growing detachment. The 2024 study published in ‘Frontiers’ also found that children’s emotional intelligence is negatively impacted by their parents’ phone use. When parents use screens in the presence of their children, the outward appearance of distraction sends a powerful message, “I’m not present.” This leads to what researchers call ‘still face,’ an expressionless appearance that can further inhibit a child’s ability to develop emotional skills.This parental ‘technoference’—the interference of technology in routine parent-child interactions—has far-reaching effects. According to a 2023 cohort study published in ‘JAMA Network’, children whose parents frequently used phones reported higher levels of anxiety, attention issues, and hyperactivity. The study, which tracked over 1,300 children aged 9-11, found that parental phone use disrupts important emotional and social cues, contributing to developmental delays in children. However, in today’s fast-paced work environment and digital landscape, many parents feel they have no choice.Laxmi Upadhyay, a grocery shop owner and a parent of a nine-year-old from Lalitpur, says, ‘These days, everything from paying bills to shopping and work is tied to our phones. It may seem like parents are always on their phones, but it’s hard to avoid using them.”Psychologist Bina Shrestha from “Mankaa Kura” (a mental health platform) says the solution isn’t for parents to avoid phones entirely, but tailoring the content they consume and their device habits. She adds, “With work now tied to gadgets and phones, especially for parents juggling jobs and further studies, people spend a lot of their time on devices. In the past, it was easier to separate work from home, but now, phones blur that line, leading to a lack of emotional and social connection for children.”According to her, from a child’s perspective, it often seems like their parents are constantly on their phones, and with the already poor communication patterns in many Nepali families, this lack of interaction creates a gap in parent-child relationships.Anuja, a 16-year-old from Kalanki, has seen this play out firsthand. Anuja (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) shared how her father, a reporter for an online media outlet, is always busy with his phone or laptop, even during family time. “Even at home, during dinner or family time, his attention is divided between us and his devices. I miss having real conversations with him, and now my eight-year-old brother is following the same habit, constantly playing video games on his phone”, said Anuja.The effects of this detachment are not only emotional but also behavioural, says psychologist Shrestha. Children, like Soham and Kenjal, mimic their parents’ screen habits, reinforcing a cycle of phone dependency that starts early and persists into adolescence. Dangers though don’t end with emotional detachment.With greater exposure to the internet comes heightened vulnerability. Research conducted by Voice of Children and KNH Germany in 2023 showed that 38.6 percent of girls and 32.3 percent of boys reported receiving sexual calls and messages.In fiscal year 2023-24, the Nepal Cyber Bureau recorded 635 cases of cyber violence involving children, up from 176 cases in fiscal year 2022-23—for a 260.8 percent rise.As parents manoeuvre the digital age, the responsibility of guiding their children through it has never been more critical. The irony of parents lamenting their children’s phone addiction while mirroring the same behaviour is a cycle that must be broken. Children are not born obsessed with screens—they learn it from the adults around them, says Shrestha. According to Shrestha, parents should establish work timetables, just as children have study schedules, to help kids understand when it’s time for work and when it’s family time. Parents should also explain to their children the purpose behind their phone or gadget usage. “As a work-from-home parent, I’ve made it a point to help my young child understand that when I’m on my phone, I’m working, as this differentiation is crucial for young children to learn….Otherwise, children may simply mimic our behaviour of spending time on gadgets and become isolated.”Many parents fall into the habit of giving their phones to their children to keep them occupied while they manage household chores. Shrestha warns that this practice diminishes critical parent-child interaction. Instead, she suggests watching appropriate and fun content together, which can create bonding and interaction for the emotional and language development of children.“Regulating screen time shouldn’t solely focus on limiting children’s usage; parents also need to manage their device habits. Children imitate parent’s behaviour so parents should model healthy interactions with technology”, she adds.

The death toll of the calamity crossed 200, thousands have been homeless, and the damage it has inflicted upon the national economy is still to be fully assessed.

He had been a victim of the monkey menace for years. But these days Magar of Phek Dangsinghdanda, Ribdikot rural municipality-8 is not much worried. He plans to earn Rs700,000 from the same land which until two years ago yielded nothing because monkeys, including other wild animals, ate up all the crops. Some farmers even left the village.Magar's life suddenly changed after he started growing chillies. Monkeys don’t like chillies and they don't even come close to the crop. Till October, he sold chillies worth Rs 350,000 and plans to double the income by the end of this year. He has cultivated round chillies on three ropanies of land.“Previously, the crops were destroyed by monkeys, porcupines, boars and other animals. My income was just zero two years back,” said Magar. “This year, I expect a good earning as the chilli variety I’ve grown is highly demanded in the market.”Bishnu Bahadur Karki from Bhairabstan, Ribdikot rural municipality-4 hopes to earn Rs800,000 this year from round chilies. He has already made nearly a half of that. He still plans to earn Rs450,000 from the sales of round chillies.Karki, who has cultivated round chillis on six ropanis, said that the price of round chillies has nearly doubled this year.“We have not only got the value for our products, but market access too,” said Karki. “As the price is fixed in advance, it is less risky for farmers.”Besides Magar and Karki, nearly 1,500 farmers from Ribdikot rural municipality-8 are making an income from the crop. Ribdikot, once known for ginger production, now sees a future in round chilli cultivation.Round chillies were primarily cultivated in Ilam, Panchthar, Dhakuta of the east. Four years ago, round chillies were planted in Ribdikot as a trial but later the rural municipality earned more than Rs60 million from the commodity, and encouraged more farmers to grow the crop in a commercial way.With the increase in the value of round chilli this year, farmers easily managed the expenses for their festivities.“We used to take loans to celebrate festivals. But with the round chilli farming boom, we need no loans from anyone,” said Sita Khamcha of Phake, Ribdikot rural municipality. She hopes to earn Rs500,000 from round chillies.Last year, round chillies fetched Rs150 per kg but this year the minimum price has been set at Rs220 per kg. The floor price was set in coordination with Ribdikot rural municipality, said Sita. Farmers are getting Rs260 per kg.Farmers said the market is no problem for round chillies—both red and green varieties. Narayan Bahadur GC, a former ward chairman, is the director of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udyog. He introduced round chillies to local farmers with the support from the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project. “In Palpa, it is now grown commercially,” said GC.

He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well.

In a show of dissent, the party organised a protest rally in Kathmandu on October 26.As the main opposition party in the House, the Maoist Centre marked the new government’s 100th day with the protest rally, but its leaders say they have no specific programmes planned until the by-elections for the local level.The Election Commission is set to hold the by-elections for vacant seats in 39 local units on December 1. “Before the local-level by-election, our party may not organise any major event,\" Yubaraj Chaulagain, a Bagmati Province lawmaker and politburo member of the party, told the Post. “Now our focus will be on the by-elections.” Chaulagain also said that the party will convene a central committee meeting soon after the by-election to chart out the party's strategy ahead. Lekhanath Dahal, a federal lawmaker from the party, echoes Chaulagain, stating that while the party does not have any event, they were encouraged by public participation in their protest rally. He further adds that public interest in the Maoist Centre was evident from the turnout at the rally.“With the support of the people, we will come up with protest programmes against the steps taken by the current KP Sharma Oli-led government, which appears to be encouraging corruption and inefficient governance,” Dahal told the Post.Although Maoist Centre leaders assert that more people support their party because of their effective performance in the immediate past government, political analysts refuse to buy such claims. Like most other political parties, the Maoist Centre has also struggled with a lack of political agenda, which has caused a void in party activity, political analysts claim. “It is one thing to claim that the government under your leadership was better and more effective than others, but to claim that the Maoist Centre’s performance attracting the masses is farcical,” professor of political science Krishna Pokharel told the Post. In Pokhrel's opinion, the lack of a pro-people agenda has caused parties to drift away from the public. A clear example of this is their failure to come up with an effective programme for a long time, he said.Maoist Centre can provide a tough competition in the upcoming general elections if the party establishes itself as a strong opposition in Parliament, Pokharel adds.But the leaders of the Maoist center claim that it is wrong to say that they lack a pro-people programme and agenda. They say that they are working to reunite with the factions that split from the original Maoist party, to attract more public support.Since losing power, the Maoist center has made many efforts to strengthen itself, including reviving the Socialist Front. The party, which later forgot the Socialist Front that it created while in power, organised a meeting in July, right after losing power, and announced plans to reactivate it.However, with other parties affiliated to the Socialist Front focussed on their own internal issues, the front’s activities have stalled. The Front is an alliance of smaller, like-minded political parties with a socialist orientation.However, Lekhanath Dahal, the Maoist Centre leader, claims that the Socialist Front will hold a meeting soon. The Front’s meeting in July had formed a three-member task force to strengthen the front, and based on their recommendations, a full meeting will be scheduled soon.

A clear example of this is their failure to come up with an effective programme for a long time, he said.Maoist Centre can provide a tough competition in the upcoming general elections if the party establishes itself as a strong opposition in Parliament, Pokharel adds.But the leaders of the Maoist center claim that it is wrong to say that they lack a pro-people programme and agenda. They say that they are working to reunite with the factions that split from the original Maoist party, to attract more public support.Since losing power, the Maoist center has made many efforts to strengthen itself, including reviving the Socialist Front. The party, which later forgot the Socialist Front that it created while in power, organised a meeting in July, right after losing power, and announced plans to reactivate it.However, with other parties affiliated to the Socialist Front focussed on their own internal issues, the front’s activities have stalled. The Front is an alliance of smaller, like-minded political parties with a socialist orientation.However, Lekhanath Dahal, the Maoist Centre leader, claims that the Socialist Front will hold a meeting soon. The Front’s meeting in July had formed a three-member task force to strengthen the front, and based on their recommendations, a full meeting will be scheduled soon.

Congress is the largest party in the government led by KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML.Koirala, who contested for the post of party president and got defeated by Sher Bahadur Deuba three years ago, leads the anti-establishment faction in the party.Koirala has been raising critical questions against the government’s wrongdoings, causing apprehension among those in government. At times, he has even taken a stance against the government’s moves.For instance, Prime Minister Oli and Energy Minister Dipak Khadka are at loggerheads with Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Managing Director Kul Man Ghising over whether or not to disrupt power supply to the companies defaulting in paying the NEA’s bills.In this prolonged dispute, Koirala has supported Ghising, who is backed by the main opposition, the CPN (Maoist Centre).Koirala was once a proponent of the Congress-UML coalition when Maoist Centre ditched the Congress to join hands with UML. He also played a role in forging an alliance with the UML to form a provincial government led by a Congress lawmaker in Koshi.Observers say that his latest stances are part of his strategy to present himself as a strong candidate for the party president in the next general convention, which should be held by the end of 2025 in accordance with the party statute.“It is possible that he is trying to establish himself as the main contender of the party leadership for the next convention, making the party rank and file believe that no other leaders can give alternatives to the party other than him,” Rajesh Gautam, a historian who has written multiple books on Congress, told the Post.As party president Sher Bahadur Deuba has already announced not to contest for the top post in the general convention, second-rung Congress leaders have already started making assumptions about the next leadership.Koirala, who lost to Deuba by a small margin for the party’s top post in 2021, is considered an untested leader because he hasn’t taken any key position in the party and has not even become a minister so far.Party leaders close to Koirala say that he was making comments based on the merit of the government’s performance.They say that by making such comments, Koirala has been trying to bring the government on the right track when it fumbles. Sometimes, he might seem harsh towards the government, but that is aimed at correcting the coalition and not toppling it, they argue.“Before Congress-UML came together to form the government, Koirala was one of the leaders who had advocated for the coalition of the two biggest parties,” Govindaraj Pokharel, a Congress leader close to Koirala, told the Post. “Therefore, as the proponent of the present coalition, he might have thought it was his moral duty to question the government if it cannot live up to its promise.”But Gautam differs.The performance of the government is below par and even the layman can find faults in its functioning, Gautam says.The Congress-UML government was formed in July based on a seven-point agreement, and its basic duty is to work to fulfill it. When the government deviates from its promised objectives to other issues, Pokharel says, Koirala sometimes becomes critical of the government to remind it of its objectives.In the recent party programme held on October 10, Koirala mentioned the three areas where the government had unnecessarily poked its nose: by not allowing the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) chief Kul Man Ghising to work as per his plan, by trying to unseat the Deputy Speaker Indira Magar Rana, and by planning to issue an ordinance related to Political Parties.Pokharel argues that Koirala has supported the government’s right move. When the government decided to constitute a high-level commission to recommend reforms to revitalise the ailing economy under the leadership of former finance secretary Rameshwar Khanal, Koirala welcomed it, Pokharel says.Apart from that, he adds, Koirala never criticised the government when it decided to take the tasks of the peace process ahead, pay the due amounts of sugarcane farmers, or form a committee to revitalise the country's tourism sector. However, the wrong act of the government should be questioned, and even though he is a leader from the coalition partner and he is not mincing words, Pokharel says.Jeevan Pariyar, a Congress joint general secretary, also says that Koirala's opinion on holding the government accountable should not be misinterpreted.“However, the government is still to fulfill its promises,” Pariyar told the Post.Two days ago, the government decided to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at government hospitals. Pariyar describes it as a latest example of the positive initiatives taken by the government.Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel decided on Sunday to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at Kanti Children’s Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital and BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital Bharatpur.There is no point in getting disappointed by the government since it has only completed 100 days, Pariyar says.However, some Congress leaders think the government is not working as per their expectation.In Monday’s meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives, Congress lawmaker Hirdayaram Thani raised several questions to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, a Congress leader, about the home ministry’s performance.“Where has the investigation on the irregularities on Giri Bandhu tea estate reached?” Thani questioned Home Minister Lekhak. The Giri Bandhu land scam is linked to Prime Minister Oli and Congress, which officially made its position clear through its parliamentary party meeting on May 14 and demanded an investigation into the decision-making process of the land swap permit. Thani also asked the home minister why investigations on various other corruption scams weren’t moving ahead satisfactorily.Pokharel, the Congress leader, says questioning the government does not mean the Congress leader does not favour this coalition government.“The duty of leaders who are representing the party in the government is to do better work,” Pokharel says. “It is also the duty of leaders out of the government to question it to make it accountable to the people.” ","summary":"As the government completes 100 days in office, some leaders from its major coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, have started to comment on the government’s performance—often unfavourably.Remarks by some key Congress leaders, particularly by senior Congress leader Shekhar Koirala, have alarmed a section of the governing parties.

He to be honest with the people hereon.“Rest assured and run the government, don’t worry much about whether the Maoists will again come to power.”Observers, however, doubt Dahal’s claim as it has only been just over 100 days since the Maoist party was ousted from the government. They also say the party, while being in the government for most of the past decade or so, hasn’t achieved much.Moreover, whatever Dahal might say, there is no way to remove the government unless there is a tussle between the two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.The observers thus see the Maoist Centre’s protest as an outcome of the Maoist leaders’ restlessness over being out of the government for some months. In the 275-strong House of Representatives that elects the prime minister, the biggest coalition partner, the Congress, has 88 seats while the prime minister’s UML party has 78 seats. Thus the two largest coalition partners alone command a comfortable majority. Some other fringe parties have also joined the government. Maoist Centre General Secretary Dev Gurung says Dahal addressed the issue after a meeting of the ruling parties on Friday concluded that efforts were on to topple the government.“Attempts to seek an alternative to the democratic system and government cannot be acceptable,” said the seven-point joint statement of the ruling parties. Gurung said that they just tried to clear the misconception. “Despite having a majority in the House, the way they are panicking about a possible government change is something unusual,” he said.Political experts said the only way to change the government at present is by proving a majority in the House.“The Maoists always get restless when they are not in the government, and it is no different now,” Mumaram Khanal, a political analyst, told the Post. “Today’s agitation is nothing but a means to show that the party’s relevance will remain intact until the next elections.”The Maoist Centre is a party that has been in power for most of the nine years since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015.But why did the party have to call for a protest no sooner than it had left the government? Maoist Centre General Secretary Gurung refused to answer the question. But when the same query was put before Agni Sapkota, vice-chair and spokesperson for the Maoist Centre, he accused the Oli government of failing on all fronts save for its initiative to push for the completion of the peace process. “That is one reason which compelled us to organise a meeting of this kind,” Sapkota said.After the formation of the UML-Congress coalition in mid-July, the ruling parties including the main opposition have amended the transitional justice related law.Similarly, the party leaders who spoke at the mass gathering on Saturday raised questions about the prime minister’s prolonged absence from the country even as Nepal was being ravaged by floods and landslides.Prime Minister Oli was in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly at the time. Some people then accused the prime minister of showing insensitivity after he refused to cut short his US trip. When the Post talked to some participants of Saturday’s mass gathering, they struggled to come up with a rationale for the protest programme. But a few of them did question the Oli government’s record on governance and the prime minister’s supposed protection of the corrupt people in the government even while cracking down on those from opposition parties. They also questioned the UML’s acceptance of a piece of expensive real estate from a controversial businessman.

Dahal accused the government of protecting corrupt officials and sidestepping accountability measures. “This government appears to have been formed to shield—not expose—corruption,” he said.The Maoist chief also questioned why leaders from the UML and the Congress who have also been accused of misappropriating funds from various cooperatives, have faced no action. “Those named in the [parliamentary panel] report should be investigated and arrested if guilty,” he said, adding that selectively targeting opposition members for investigation is unjust.But political analyst Khanal doesn’t buy the argument. “Until today, which government has taken action against powerful people?” he questions. “What Dahal is saying is propaganda,” Khanal told the Post.

While presenting his accomplishments, Oli committed to take action against cooperatives frauds and to refund the money of depositors.As the prime minister claimed that the government was making progress in terms of creating the environment for returning the savings of cooperatives depositors, the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors has announced the fourth phase of protest, accusing the authorities of not implementing the agreements reached with them in the past.Alleging the government’s non-commitment to implementing its earlier promises made with the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors, leaders of the campaign on Thursday organised a press meet in Kathmandu on Thursday where they announced to start the fourth phase of protests from November 20.They said they would still wait for the government to implement the agreements until the deadline. The representatives of the victims claimed that the fourth phase of the protest would be a decisive one.“Despite reaching an eight-point agreement one-and-a-half months ago, the government has not cared to address the problem since. Therefore, we planned to resume our protest,” Kusluv KC, chair of the campaign, told the Post.“Minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation [Balaram Adhikari]’s claim at a press conference on Wednesday that they addressed our concerns made us furious.”The government had reached an eight-point agreement with the cooperatives victims on September 9. It was the third agreement signed between the government and the depositors who lost their savings within a year.“Not only are cooperatives frauds being prosecuted, but initiatives are also being taken to formulate a cooperatives authority act, and establish a cooperatives credit information centre and debt recovery tribunal that are necessary to refund depositors’ money,\" Prime Minister Oli said, while presenting the government's progress in its 100 days in office on Wednesday.Cooperatives victims resumed their third phase of protests on June 24, accusing the government of failing to implement agreements signed with two ministers in the past.The victims staged the first phase of their agitation in June last year. They reached a seven-point agreement with Ranjita Shrestha, then-minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation.As the agreement was not implemented, they launched the second phase of agitation. On March 22 this year, they signed an eight-point agreement with Minister Adhikari.The victims suspended their 108-day protest following the eight-point agreement of September 9 as the government reiterated its promise to return their savings. The eight points were agreed upon after a negotiation between the representatives of the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors and government officials in the presence of Arjun Prasad Pokharel, the secretary at the ministry.As per the agreement, a committee was formed with the sub-registrar of the Cooperatives Department as coordinator. Its mandate was to continuously assist in collecting and analysing data to address issues, including the return of depositors’ savings. The committee comprises representatives from the ministry and the national campaign. The campaign chair, Kushluv KC, said Singh KC, a Kuleshwar-based Gautam Shree Cooperative victim, agreed to represent them on the committee. “The committee agreed to monitor the inspection of crisis-ridden cooperatives, collect all the details, and categorise cooperatives,” Kushluv KC told the Post. “The committee was supposed to present its findings and recommendations to the department after analysing the collected data.”But one and a half months after the third-phase agreement, government agencies did not seem positive about holding the meeting as agreed to solve the problem, KC blamed.The committee agreed to conduct financial analysis of the inspected cooperatives, categorise them as well-functioning, crisis-oriented, and crisis-ridden, and recommend necessary actions. It was also agreed that a review meeting would be held at the Ministry of Land Management on the last Sunday of every month to assess the committee’s progress. However, the cooperatives victims say no point of the agreement was implemented.Similarly, the agreement reaffirmed the government's commitment to implementing the previous agreements made with cooperatives victims.“The victims might have thought that the execution of the agreement means immediate receipt of money, which has not happened,” Tola Raj Upadhyaya, deputy registrar and information officer at the Department of Cooperatives, said. “But the government is seriously working to implement the agreement.”In a separate announcement, the government had announced to return the money of small depositors in troubled cooperatives during the budget presentation. It has, however, defaulted on this pledge as well.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024-25 on May 28, the government announced a plan to refund the savings of these small depositors.“To solve the problem in the savings and credit cooperatives, arrangements will be made to return depositers’ money up to Rs500,000 by using the property of cooperatives operators or of their immediate kin as collateral,” then-finance minister Barsha Man Pun said in his budget speech in Parliament.The Post talked to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation officials shortly after the budget presentation for clarification on how the refund plan would go ahead.At the time, ministry officials had said the government policy, already endorsed by Parliament, would take effect from the start of the new fiscal year. However, five months into the new fiscal year, the government is still busy drafting guidelines to carry out the refund.“Apart from drafting guidelines, we also are waiting for the real data on the cooperatives victims; we are yet to receive the data from the provincial and local governments,” Upadhyaya told the Post. “Once the data is obtained, the money of the victims will be returned by selling the property of the people who misappropriated cooperatives funds.” ","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli presented his government’s 100-day report on Wednesday.

The eight points were agreed upon after a negotiation between the representatives of the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors and government officials in the presence of Arjun Prasad Pokharel, the secretary at the ministry.As per the agreement, a committee was formed with the sub-registrar of the Cooperatives Department as coordinator. Its mandate was to continuously assist in collecting and analysing data to address issues, including the return of depositors’ savings. The committee comprises representatives from the ministry and the national campaign. The campaign chair, Kushluv KC, said Singh KC, a Kuleshwar-based Gautam Shree Cooperative victim, agreed to represent them on the committee. “The committee agreed to monitor the inspection of crisis-ridden cooperatives, collect all the details, and categorise cooperatives,” Kushluv KC told the Post. “The committee was supposed to present its findings and recommendations to the department after analysing the collected data.”But one and a half months after the third-phase agreement, government agencies did not seem positive about holding the meeting as agreed to solve the problem, KC blamed.The committee agreed to conduct financial analysis of the inspected cooperatives, categorise them as well-functioning, crisis-oriented, and crisis-ridden, and recommend necessary actions. It was also agreed that a review meeting would be held at the Ministry of Land Management on the last Sunday of every month to assess the committee’s progress. However, the cooperatives victims say no point of the agreement was implemented.Similarly, the agreement reaffirmed the government's commitment to implementing the previous agreements made with cooperatives victims.“The victims might have thought that the execution of the agreement means immediate receipt of money, which has not happened,” Tola Raj Upadhyaya, deputy registrar and information officer at the Department of Cooperatives, said. “But the government is seriously working to implement the agreement.”In a separate announcement, the government had announced to return the money of small depositors in troubled cooperatives during the budget presentation. It has, however, defaulted on this pledge as well.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024-25 on May 28, the government announced a plan to refund the savings of these small depositors.“To solve the problem in the savings and credit cooperatives, arrangements will be made to return depositers’ money up to Rs500,000 by using the property of cooperatives operators or of their immediate kin as collateral,” then-finance minister Barsha Man Pun said in his budget speech in Parliament.The Post talked to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation officials shortly after the budget presentation for clarification on how the refund plan would go ahead.At the time, ministry officials had said the government policy, already endorsed by Parliament, would take effect from the start of the new fiscal year. However, five months into the new fiscal year, the government is still busy drafting guidelines to carry out the refund.“Apart from drafting guidelines, we also are waiting for the real data on the cooperatives victims; we are yet to receive the data from the provincial and local governments,” Upadhyaya told the Post. “Once the data is obtained, the money of the victims will be returned by selling the property of the people who misappropriated cooperatives funds.” "},{"hash":"f51b346f5eb3192f2d957a1a6713f515ca2a4705cbe4c3cc76c857baa3848e8c","title":"ruling-coalition-dismisses-opposition-protests-as-undemocratic-unacceptable","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/10/26/ruling-coalition-dismisses-opposition-protests-as-undemocratic-unacceptable","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Untitled4-1729906619.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1729900800000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"As opposition parties hit streets against the coalition government, the ruling parties unanimously have said no act to seek alternatives to the current political system and government from the streets is acceptable.A meeting of the seven ruling parties has affirmed that the government’s alternative should be sought only through the parliamentary process or through people’s fresh mandate.

The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways.

An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways.

The report recommended that Developing Asia be made more committed to tackling climate change.Based on a 2023 study supported by the ADB, over 2041–2070, case numbers could rise by as much as 69 percent for malaria and 113 percent for dengue. However, the study said better access to drinking (tap) water and improved household waste management can reduce disease risks by eliminating informal water storage that serves as mosquito breeding sites.The study also showed that Nepal’s investments to reach the Sustainable Development Goals on water and sanitation and improving waste management could reduce infections from malaria by 17 percent and from dengue by 41 percent in urban areas. “Improving WASH services can also deliver other health benefits, such as lessening diarrhoeal disease and increasing good hygiene practices, as well as helping to build resilience to vector-borne diseases.”The ADB research finds the impacts of climate change could reduce gross domestic product (GDP) in developing Asia and the Pacific by 17 percent by 2070 under a high-end greenhouse gas emissions scenario, rising to 41 percent by 2100.Rising sea levels and falling labour productivity would cause the most significant losses, with lower incomes and fragile economies hardest hit. The new research in the inaugural issue of ADB’s Asia-Pacific Climate Report details a series of damaging impacts threatening the region. The report said that if the climate crisis continues to accelerate, up to 300 million people in the region could be threatened by coastal inundation, and trillions of dollars of coastal assets could be damaged annually by 2070.The Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that the risk of vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria and dengue) will increase if individual economies do not take climate change adaptation measures. Due to increased temperatures and altered weather patterns, more localities will become suitable breeding grounds for disease vectors, such as mosquitoes.“Climate change has supercharged the devastation from tropical storms, heat waves, and floods in the region, contributing to unprecedented economic challenges and human suffering,” said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. “Urgent, well-coordinated climate action that addresses these impacts is needed before it is too late.”The report finds that regional public sentiment supports climate action. In an ADB climate change perception study this year, 91 percent of respondents across 14 regional economies said they view global warming as a serious problem, with many seeking more ambitious government action. To address growing climate risks, adaptation responses need to be accelerated, and adaptation-focused climate finance must be greatly upscaled.The report values annual investment needs for regional countries to adapt to global warming at between $102 billion and $431 billion—far exceeding the $34 billion of tracked adaptation finance in the region in 2021–2022. On the mitigation front, the report shows that the region is well placed to embrace renewable energy and drive a transition to net zero and that forging ahead with domestic and international carbon markets can help achieve climate action goals cost-effectively.Investments in WASH can help reduce health risks exacerbated by climate change. The report said that agriculture is vulnerable to increased frequency of extreme climatic events due to climate change. However, achieving goals under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is likely to depend on expanding carbon sequestration through forests, limiting land availability for agriculture.In most Paris Agreement-compatible emissions pathways scenarios, bioenergy use rises, often combined with carbon capture and storage. Bioenergy production also reduces the land area available for growing food crops.The report said that in 2023, the ADB released a study that models a set of scenarios compatible with the Paris Agreement, then contrasts these scenarios with current policies. This modelling considers both the deployment of bioenergy and expanded forest cover and other energy-related mitigation options. The Paris Agreement compatible scenarios find that the land area for growing food crops in developing Asia will decrease by 36 million hectares by 2050 and 58 million hectares by 2070. Much of this is driven by the expansion of bioenergy crops, which will reach 97 million hectares in the region by 2070. As a result, food prices will reach values 35 percent higher than they would be under current policies by 2065.“Agriculture, therefore, clearly needs adaptation to emissions mitigation policies, as well as to the impacts of climate change, to avoid adverse food security outcomes,” the report said. Climate change will lead to new disease burdens, including new and emerging climate-related vector-borne diseases (e.g., chikungunya, dengue). The G20 High-Level Independent Panel calls for more robust disease surveillance and detection networks, coordinated regional action and information sharing.This will require a significant expansion of surveillance networks and the development of global, regional, and national expertise. Embodied agricultural innovations, including stress-tolerant varieties, can help address climate shifts using existing extension systems. Agricultural research has a key role in adaptation, and related studies provide very positive cost-benefit ratios for investing in research to address climate change risks. High-returns research products include stress-tolerant crop varieties, especially for drought and floods. They require transmission of much more information among farmers. More iterative and interactive extension approaches, such as farmer field schools, demand responsive approaches, such as farmer contracted extension, and gender-sensitive approaches all show promise to improve the adoption of knowledge-intensive practices, according to the report.As climate change may affect the energy sector, the report said there is potential to build climate resilience into energy supply. The Asia and Pacific region is receiving some of the most significant flows of investment into energy supply, with an increasing share of this investment being in green and renewable energy. However, this new infrastructure is vulnerable to climate change, especially given its long lifetime, and it is important to address these climate risks during design, a concept known as ‘climate-proofing’.“Doing so involves low additional costs and is highly cost-effective, generating benefits four times greater than the costs,” the report said.Several smaller economies, including Bhutan, Nepal, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan, generate most of their electricity (86 percent-100 percent) through hydropower.According to the report, substantial investments are needed in generation capacity and energy storage, grid enhancement, and smart grid technologies to manage the intermittent nature of sources such as wind and solar energy and achieve net zero emissions.Meanwhile, the extensive hydropower resources in developing Asia can support grid stability as wind and solar power capacity increases, and enhanced grid interconnection can help mitigate intermittency challenges further.However, effective climate-proofing often requires enabling actions by the government, including changes to design standards.Nepal’s second Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, is each country's national climate action plan under the Paris Agreement. The submission provides more details than the first plan. It includes quantified targets for agriculture, energy, forestry, and waste and a commitment to gender equality and social inclusion by empowering women, Indigenous people, and youth in climate policy.Despite these updates, the report said that NDC commitments across developing Asia remain insufficient to align with the Paris Agreement goals.The report said that 44 economies of developing Asia with submitted NDCs all include targets for the energy sector. Still, only 40 include targets for the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sectors.Moreover, just 30 economies have targets for the industry sector despite this sector's crucial role in decarbonisation.Forty- four economies, representing 98 percent of the region’s emissions, have ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement and submitted nationally determined contributions (NDCs) with commitments to cut GHG emissions and adapt to climate change.In addition, 36 of these economies have announced or adopted net-zero targets. However, according to the report, current actions fall short of what is needed to limit the global temperature rise to 2°C or, ideally, 1.5°C.The NDCs and net zero targets lack concrete, sector-specific emission reduction road maps.Implementing decarbonisation plans faces key challenges, including institutional capacity gaps, governance issues, insufficient financing, limited access to technology and expertise, and vulnerability to climate events that divert resources from decarbonisation efforts.The ADB climate change perception survey conducted in 2024 finds that 91 percent of people in 14 economies in developing Asia view climate change as a severe problem. Additionally, 84 percent of respondents report that they and their families are already experiencing climate change impacts or expect to within the next decade.  ","summary":"Without appropriate intervention on universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation and adequate hygiene (WASH) services, the number of malaria and dengue cases in Nepal could increase by up to 27 percent and 44 percent, respectively, over 2011–2040, according to the new study of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) released on Thursday.

Tihar goods are costly.” Some traders say they had to offset losses by increasing prices because transport costs rose heavily due to the damage to roads, mainly those connecting the Kathmandu valley.Sisters gift packets of nutritious nuts, seeds, and other items to their brothers during the ceremonies, and sales soar during this time of the year.According to the association, Tihar accounts for 40 percent of dry fruit sales. As demand increases fourfold during festivities, prices rise. This year, the road from the Chinese border in the north was severely affected, halting trade for a month.The Rasuwagadhi border was opened on Tuesday after a month of closure. Customs officials say one-way traffic has resumed on the 24 km road stretch from Rasuwagadhi to Kerung in China, which was damaged by the late September floods.Due to the road's closure, commercial goods worth millions of Nepali businessmen were stored in warehouses at the border and various cities in China for months. Traders say rotting has damaged fruits and spices worth millions of rupees. Cargo coming to Kathmandu, the country’s commercial hub, from the southern border points was also affected, as the road connecting the Valley was severely affected by floods and landslides.According to the association, the price of cashews has swelled from Rs1,600 per kg last year to Rs2,000 per kg. The price of almonds has jumped to Rs1,700 per kg from Rs1,300 per kg last year.The price of walnuts has reached Rs650 per kg this festive season, up from Rs450 per kg a year ago. The price of pistachios remains unchanged at Rs2,100 per kg.“Prices of other dried fruits like raisin, dates, coconut, green cardamom, cloves and betel nuts have also increased by Rs100 to Rs150 per kg,” said Bajracharya.The dried fruits sold in the bazaars of Kathmandu are imported from diverse sources like Brazil, Afghanistan, Vietnam, the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Central America and the Middle East.Similarly, according to florists, marigold flowers, one of the Tihar essentials, are set to become costlier this year.Garlands—makhamali or marigold flowers strung together for the occasion—hold huge cultural significance during this festival, as sisters put them around their brothers' necks on a special day to honour their sacred bond.“The late monsoon rains have caused loss to flower producers. Marigold flowers ready to be supplied to the market have been damaged by the insistent rains and flooding in many parts of the Kathmandu valley, including the neighbouring districts,” said Min Bahadur Tamang, president of Floriculture Association Nepal. “This will create a gap between demand and supply, increasing prices.”He added, “We expect the price of metre-long marigold garlands to reach Rs125 this year compared to Rs100 during last year’s Tihar.” A metre-long garland contains 40 flowers.Vibrant yellow marigolds and milky white chrysanthemums are necessary offerings to the goddess of wealth, Laxmi, during Tihar. Colourful blossoms are a major item during the festival, as people adorn the doors and windows of their houses with strings of flowers as part of the rituals.“We expect transactions of Rs400 million from 4 million marigold garlands across the country and around 30,000 chrysanthemum (Godavari) garlands,” said Tamang.According to the Floriculture Association Nepal, the globe amaranth (makhamali) is in demand for 500,000 garlands. This includes 150,000 garlands for export. Tamang said that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is seizing illegally imported flowers for Tihar in Kathmandu. Recently, the metropolis took control of marigold flowers from three cold stores in Balaju.“Even today [Tuesday], a truck of flower garlands was impounded at Jaya Bageshwori in Kathmandu,” said Tamang.Indian marigolds are not being legally imported this festive season as India’s agriculture ministry failed to issue a declaration letter.Tamang said plant quarantine authorities in Nepal issue an import permit for marigold only after the Indian authority issues a declaration letter that the flower is free of 16 types of insect diseases.

Seeking help for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is often a last resort.Seema Kumari Pasman, a 20-year-old from Karmahi village in Dhanusha who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy, is one such example.Married at 16 in 2019, she quickly became a mother of two children by 2022.After two child births, her menstrual complications worsened, yet she had no frame of reference to understand that what she was experiencing—menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding—was a medical condition.Pasman endured a year of painful, prolonged periods that she had been taught were simply part of a woman’s life—a burden, not a condition needing treatment.Daily chores became unbearable for her but those around her continued to dismiss her symptoms.One night in December 2023, after collapsing while fetching water from a hand pump, Pasman’s family rushed her to Janakpur Provincial Hospital.There, doctors diagnosed her with severe anaemia from untreated menorrhagia. “The doctors told me that if I had received earlier intervention, my suffering could have been prevented...but I only thought it was normal,” Pasman says.The culture of silence around SRH issues means that women like Pasman get help only when their conditions are critical.A 2018 study in the Journal of Health and Allied Sciences reported low awareness of SRH rights among 384 married Madheshi women in Sarlahi. Three-fifths were unaware of these rights, and the same proportion reported experiences of physical and dowry-related violence.Chandra Rekha Issar, a gynaecologist at Janakpur Provincial Hospital and assistant professor at the Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences (MIHS), says that for many women, the concept of openly talking about SRH—especially with male doctors—is almost unthinkable.In rural Madhesh, as part of ‘ghunghat pratha’, married women have limited interaction with unrelated men outside their family. They are often expected to wear a veil in front of everyone except their husbands and rarely go outside alone for extended periods.This restrictive environment creates a hesitation among women to discuss their SRH. When these women visit a gynaecologist and are assigned a male doctor, it often leads to discomfort.Health consultations can thus become uncomfortable or are avoided altogether, exacerbating a pattern of undiagnosed and untreated conditions.At Janakpur Hospital, this cultural barrier plays out every single day.Kamala Devi Mandal, a 30-year-old woman from Khariyani, Janakpur, sat clutching her veil in the waiting area of the Department of Gynaecology, with her mother in law on the side.When her turn came, Mandal hesitated upon seeing a male gynaecologist, Raj Kishor Pandit, at the door. Despite a female attendant’s presence, Mandal’s mother-in-law ultimately did the talking, while Kamala remained silent, visibly uncomfortable.For Issar, these hesitations are all too familiar. She works alongside male gynaecologists in a department where only four of the 13 doctors are female.“In a setting where women are uncomfortable speaking about reproductive issues, especially with male doctors, we have to proceed carefully, often through the person accompanying the patient,” she says.Most of the female patients are accompanied by family members, as husbands are often working abroad.For something as basic as the date of their last menstrual cycle, the patient often defers to the person accompanying her. “Most of them are under a veil,” Issar added, “and removing it, even for an eye check to assess anaemia, takes coaxing… It requires long counselling for women to open up. At times, the information we receive is incomplete, which creates challenges in treatment.”If patients still hesitate to see a male gynaecologist after counselling, a female gynaecologist is assigned when possible, says Issar. However, this is often unfeasible during busy hours due to limited staff compared to the high patient load.Gynecologist Issar says that about 85 percent of the hospital’s gynaecology and obstetrics cases involve pregnancy-related complications, often worsened by malnutrition, lack of prenatal care, and early marriages.General gynaecology accounts for 15 percent of patients, with menstrual issues like dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding common among adolescents under 19, while older patients face infections, cervical cancer, and uterine prolapse.Due to early marriages, multiple childbirths, and home deliveries without medical supervision, many women develop uterine prolapse—a condition typically seen in older women but increasingly common in those as young as 30 in rural Madhesh.The gendered expectations that govern interactions in rural Madhesh leave women ill-equipped to advocate for their health.“During a health camp in Saptari, I found that over ten percent of women under 35 had uterine prolapse,” Issar says. “Early marriage and childbirth in an environment without health education or postnatal care have serious consequences.”The barriers also include outdated beliefs and superstitions which affect women’s diet and recovery after childbirth.“Although the situation has improved, women in remote Madhesh are often prohibited from consuming protein-rich foods like chicken soup or meat after giving birth,” says 24 year old Sapana Ray, a bachelor’s student in public health at Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences. “They are typically allowed only one meal of roti and are discouraged from more water and meal, as it’s believed that this prevents colds and other illnesses in the child,” Ray added, “This lack of nutrition contributes to malnutrition and anaemia, exacerbating their health issues.”When rural women lack basic health literacy, common gynaecological issues go unchecked, leading to preventable complications. For instance, over 80 percent of cases at Janakpur Provincial Hospital are critical.“Most of these severe cases could have been prevented with early intervention or just an understanding of basic health,” Issar says.As Issar sees it, comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial for educating women about sexual and reproductive health.“The government should consider monthly outreach programmes in rural areas. Women in far rural communities need direct, consistent health education,” Issar says. Further, local health posts with trained personnel could provide preventive care and answer questions women may hesitate to bring up in a hospital setting.The hospital’s efforts to include female attendants in male doctors’ consultations and to counsel women on gender-neutral healthcare only go so far. Often, patients’ deep-seated fears and hesitation prove challenging to overcome.While Madhesh’s women struggle with silence and a lack of resources, healthcare professionals are left piecing together fragmented stories, trying to heal patients who are often reluctant to share their suffering. It is a race against time and tradition.Dr Issar says that it’s unfair to blame women for hesitating to discuss their issues with gynaecologists. “We need to understand and empathise with their background,” she says.Many women, living in conservative settings, rarely have the freedom to speak openly. Given this, she questions, “How can we expect them to feel fully comfortable discussing their sexual and reproductive health, especially with a male doctor?” Even for educated urban women, she adds, these conversations can be challenging.According to Ray, consistent ground-level awareness and counselling programmes on SRH are essential, alongside changes to the conservative and predominantly patriarchal settings in rural areas. “These social barriers, even more than medical intervention, are often the primary obstacles to healthcare access for women in these communities,” she says.

Last week, Paudel pledged free care for poor burn victims who cannot afford treatment. However, most health facilities offering burn care provide only basic treatments, which often puts patients' safety at risk. Since taking office three months ago, Minister Paudel has announced several other populist programmes.While most of these initiatives—which include reducing hospital wait times, increasing government health insurance coverage to Rs500,000, and providing outpatient care on public holidays—have yet to be implemented, Paudel continues to announce more free programmes.Experts have questioned the effectiveness and sustainability of such programmes stating that previous ministers and governments would also have made similar decisions if there were simple solutions.“Only those who are unaware of the limitations and working style of our health system could be impressed by these populist announcements, but the reality is quite different,” said Sagar Rjbhandari, a health expert. Many other health programmes, including nutritious food for pregnant and nursing mothers and children in Karnali Province, as well as maternal and perinatal death surveillance, among others, have been affected by budget constraints in the current fiscal year.Health Ministry officials said they have requested UNICEF for financial help to impart mental health screening training of children for health workers.“We need around Rs700,000 to train health workers, including doctors, nurses, and paramedics, on mental health screening for children and adolescents,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “UNICEF has responded positively to our request.

The report also shows that 0.6 percent of children and adolescents were found to have been suffering from depression.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, lifetime suicidal attempts, and the future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to affect 7.2 percent of the population.Experts say that mental health problems in children and adolescents could be several times more than what the survey portrays. They say that around 10 to 15 percent of the total children and adolescent population could have been suffering from various types of mental health issues, and due to methodological problems, the survey may not accurately portray the actual problems.Health officials say that there are only around half a dozen child and adolescent psychiatric doctors in the country, and only a few are serving in state-run health facilities. Similarly, the major contributors to the treatment gap are societal beliefs, traditions and stigma associated with mental disorders, according to experts.“This training will help health workers identify problems and refer patients to health facilities with child psychiatrists and psychologists,” said Thapa.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.

The federal government has already been providing Rs100,000 in relief to each cancer patient, including children, while the provincial government provides another Rs100,000. Officials said that the Health Ministry will cover any additional amount required for the treatment of children under 14 years with cancer from its internal sources.A few days ago, Paudel also promised free care for impoverished burn victims who cannot afford treatment costs.However, most health facilities that offer burn care provide only basic treatment, which often do not ensure patient safety.Experts have welcomed the government’s decisions. However, they questioned the effectiveness and sustainability of the programmes announced by Paudel. They say that previous ministers and governments would have made similar decisions if there were simple solutions.“Most programmes announced by the current health minister cannot be implemented due to various limitations,” said Dr Sagar Rajbhandari, a health expert. “Those who are unaware of the limitations and working style of our health system could be impressed by these populist announcements, but the reality is quite different.”Due to the lack of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transplants, and other tests available for children, patients are often compelled to travel to India for treatment. Health facilities providing cancer care for children said that they lacked support staff, including trained nurses and paramedics. “Along with the decision to provide free care to children with cancer, we hope the government will invest in improving health facilities with the necessary equipment and trained human resources, which will help ensure quality care within the country,” said Dr Sudhir Sapkota, a pediatric oncologist at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. “Many patients cannot afford to go to India for these tests.”According to doctors, PET scans are essential for determining the stage of cancer. This test provides more accurate reports than any other in identifying local or metastatic tumours (which spread to other areas of the body).Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is commonly used to diagnose cancer, predict response, and determine likely disease outcomes. It also helps distinguish between different types of cancer.Likewise, bone marrow replacement is necessary when existing bone marrow fails to work properly with new stem cells. Bone marrow transplantation provides new stem cells, which help kill cancer cells directly.“‘If we can start offering the aforementioned services within the country, patients do not have to go India or other countries for treatment,” said Sapkota. “I hope the government will also work to address these shortcomings in the coming days.”It is estimated that every year in Nepal, around 1,500 children under 14 years of age suffer from various types of cancer. Of them, around 200 seek treatment at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. Doctors at the hospital said that around 50 percent of the patients suffer from blood cancer. Those seeking care at the first and second stages of cancer have a chance of full recovery.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” ","summary":"Chaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan, from November 11 to 22, COP 29 is a critical platform for nations to collectively chart and negotiate a course of action on climate change.Alongside other negotiations, this year’s COP will especially focus on establishing a new era in climate finance with the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), which will determine the financial support that developed countries provide developing nations for climate action. The goal builds upon a previous commitment made by developed countries in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020. This target was met for the first time in 2022, albeit with ongoing debates about its accuracy, adequacy and effectiveness.The NCQG is not merely a financial instrument; it embodies accountability, equity and justice principles. Developed countries bear historical responsibility for the climate crisis, while developing countries, often disproportionately vulnerable to its impacts, require significant support to mitigate risks and adapt to a changing climate. The devasting floods ravaged Nepal in the last week of September, claiming more than 200 lives and causing widespread destruction with estimated economic losses of Rs17 billion. This reminds us of this vulnerability and the urgent need for increased investment in climate adaptation measures. Importantly, the floods also highlight the escalating intensity of climate impacts and the skyrocketing demand for climate finance, particularly for adaptation. Yet, the disbursement of funds falls far short of what is required, and access to existing funds remains a significant challenge for vulnerable nations. For instance, a 2024 report by OECD/IEA reveals that of the $1,265 billion tracked in global climate mitigation and adaptation finance between 2021-22, developing countries received only an average of $179 billion, with just $30 billion going to the least developed countries (LDCs). These figures are despite the claims of overreporting of climate finance funds from developed countries, meaning that actual amounts could be even less. This illustrates the meagre reach of climate finance for low-income and least developed nations. The modality of climate finance disbursement is another contentious issue. A report by Climate Policy Initiative in 2023 shows that 61 percent of financial flows are in the form of debt instruments, while 33 percent are in the form of equity, and only 5 percent are in the form of grants. Approximately $561 billion was provided at market rates of the total debt, making up 53 percent of total tracked climate finance. This heavy dependence on debt as finance disbursement modalities to developing nations further exacerbates their financial burdens, many of which already face stagnant economies highly reliant on vulnerable sectors such as agriculture. Extreme weather events can further strain their resources, forcing them to divert significant portions of their budgets towards debt repayment instead of crucial adaptation and resilience-building measures.Charting a new courseA decisive shift is needed in how we approach climate finance. Given the increasing urgency to invest in climate action, the role of negotiators from LDCs like Nepal at COP29 can be instrumental in shaping the NCQG. To ensure that no nation is left behind in the fight against climate change, the NCQG should prioritise the following things.It is unacceptable that only 2 percent of global climate finance reached LDCs in 2021-22. The core challenges hindering LDCs from accessing climate finance include a lack of technical resources for project preparation, limited project management capacity, burdensome and inconsistent financier requirements, an inability to coordinate effectively with donors and financiers, weak public financial management practices and insufficient technical expertise in climate change programming. Therefore, when setting targets, the NCQG should incorporate elements that make finance more approachable and accessible for LDCs, considering the challenges they already endure.Climate finance has disproportionately focused on mitigation rather than adaptation for far too long. Despite global climate finance surpassing $1 trillion for the first time in 2021–22, only $63 billion (5 percent) was tracked as adaptation finance. The Adaptation Finance Gap 2023 estimates that the financial gap of adaptation is projected to reach as high as $415 annually by 2030. Closing this gap is where the NCQG could set strong targets, potentially leading to estimating and creating binding agreements to bridge the adaptation finance gap.Business, as usual, is fueling a climate catastrophe. The total cost of inaction could cost the global economy $1,266 trillion by the end of the century, according to the State of the Global Climate 2023 report. This is even if warming is limited to the ambitious target of 1.5 degrees Celcius. Annual climate finance will need to grow more than six-fold, reaching nearly $9 trillion by 2030 and further increasing to $10 trillion by 2050. In light of this, the NCQG must act as a catalyst for the urgent mobilisation of resources for adaptation and mitigation. Every dollar invested today will save countless dollars—and lives—tomorrow. While the need for increased climate finance is undeniable, ensuring it is fairly distributed and reaches the needy is equally crucial. Developing countries, often lacking the capacity to navigate complex funding mechanisms, are either being left behind or are struggling for years to access urgently required climate finance. The NCQG must champion equity, accessibility and faster disbursement, empowering vulnerable nations to take ownership. This means simplifying procedures and ensuring that funding reaches local communities where it can make the biggest difference.The World Economic Forum emphasises that the climate crisis is too big, too serious and too urgent to rely solely on the resources of public institutions. The NCQG negotiations must incentivise private sector involvement by creating an enabling environment in climate-friendly initiatives such as clean energy, sustainable transport, green infrastructure and climate-resilient agriculture. Although climate investments often require a long-term perspective, such projects’ social benefits and sustainability can offer a win-win for both the private sector and society. Finally, transparency is the bedrock of effective climate action. This means accurately tracking climate finance and distinguishing it from traditional development aid. Furthermore, innovative and equitable mechanisms are needed to maximise the impact of limited funds. By promoting greater transparency and developing innovative mechanisms to measure the effectiveness of climate investments, we may be able to ensure that these limited funds can be meaningfully used to achieve a sustainable future. This requires robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks that track progress, identify challenges and inform adaptive management strategies.These considerations are just the tip of the iceberg. Addressing the climate crisis demands a long-term commitment to transformative change, encompassing financial mechanisms, technological innovation, policy reforms and shifts in societal behaviour. The NCQG negotiations at COP29 represent a critical opportunity to lay the foundation for this transformative change, which is crucial for tackling the climate crisis. ","summary":"This year, like every year, global leaders are preparing to convene for the 29th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 29), a pivotal international summit on climate change. Taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan, from November 11 to 22, COP 29 is a critical platform for nations to collectively chart and negotiate a course of action on climate change.Alongside other negotiations, this year’s COP will especially focus on establishing a new era in climate finance with the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), which will determine the financial support that developed countries provide developing nations for climate action. The goal builds upon a previous commitment made by developed countries in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020. This target was met for the first time in 2022, albeit with ongoing debates about its accuracy, adequacy and effectiveness.The NCQG is not merely a financial instrument; it embodies accountability, equity and justice principles. Developed countries bear historical responsibility for the climate crisis, while developing countries, often disproportionately vulnerable to its impacts, require significant support to mitigate risks and adapt to a changing climate. The devasting floods ravaged Nepal in the last week of September, claiming more than 200 lives and causing widespread destruction with estimated economic losses of Rs17 billion. This reminds us of this vulnerability and the urgent need for increased investment in climate adaptation measures. Importantly, the floods also highlight the escalating intensity of climate impacts and the skyrocketing demand for climate finance, particularly for adaptation. Yet, the disbursement of funds falls far short of what is required, and access to existing funds remains a significant challenge for vulnerable nations.

Flood frequency and severity have increased with erratic and unpredictable rainfall and heightened climate variability. For instance, in 2014, Western Nepal experienced its worst flood event, claiming 222 lives and destroying infrastructure and property. Similarly, the country experienced floods in 35 districts affecting over a million people in 2017, inundating 80 percent of land in Terai. The recent September floods took more than 200 lives, destroying homes, infrastructure and farmlands across the country. The Government of Nepal and its development partners have implemented mitigation measures such as early warning systems and flood response and preparedness guidelines to reduce the impacts of flood hazards. However, these efforts are inadequate to combat the impending flood risk. The government must overcome multiple obstacles to achieve effective emergency preparedness and response (EPR). There is a reluctance to adopt risk-informed disaster risk reduction governance, which leaves gaps in translating policies into practice. Nepal has ample policies, laws, guidelines and frameworks that enable EPR, but the implementation is lacking. For instance, the National Disaster Response Framework (NDRF) and standard operating procedures in emergency operation centres (EOCs) guide the EPR activities of stakeholders. Despite this, the absence of effective readiness and response resulted in the loss of lives and damage to property, crops and critical infrastructure in the September 2024 floods. Nepal’s capability to respond to a major disaster is highly constrained by the lack of high-tech equipment and capacities to run effective search and rescue operations. According to the Emergency Preparedness and Response Assessment 2022-23 report, the government has established emergency operation centres nationwide. Still, most of these are non-functional due to the lack of trained human resources, appropriate equipment, information technology and communication systems. Further, a few disaster information systems such as the Building Information Platform Against Disaster and the disaster risk reduction (DRR) portal exist in the country. However, these systems are weak with limited and scattered information on long-term flood forecasts.Some local governments are struggling to solve the emergent flood problems in their jurisdiction at the local level as they have limited emergency preparedness and response knowledge and skills. This is a critical obstacle in disaster response planning and policymaking, ultimately weakening the overall disaster management mechanism. Competing interests between the district’s bureaucratic actors and local governments result in a reluctance to cooperate in decision-making for local recovery and response and preparedness needs. Although new policies and actors demand effective EPR, flood risk reduction efforts are generally focused on response and recovery. For example, the Red Cross, which is the DRR secretariat for the District Administration Office, collaborate with the key federal and local actors with mandate and responsibilities to regulate first responders (Army and APF) for response and relief operation. These actors effectively respond and recover but have limited expertise in disaster risk reduction and resilience building in vulnerable communities.Damage and loss in flood-prone areas are frequently linked to a lack of community knowledge and preparedness for flood risk. Several initiatives are in place to raise community awareness, including awareness campaigns, training, school disaster curriculum, TV broadcasts and installation of early warning systems. However, such information-based approaches are futile as they only disseminate the content one way and often treat the public as passive consumers. According to research, information dissemination is ineffective in closing the knowledge gap or encouraging behavioural change. The role of individuals in response to flood risk is vital while developing effective flood preparedness.Moreover, inadequate financial readiness involving low budget allotments and dependence on external funding sources for disaster risk reduction is also hampering effective emergency preparedness and response. Pathways to strengthen it include promoting risk-informed DRR governance, increasing investment in DRR and community resilience and building capacity to change the mindset of stakeholders and communities. Risk-informed governance involves understanding multi-hazard threats, making risk-based decisions, integrating DRR strategies in development, and investing in mitigation and preparedness for effective management and recovery at all levels. Preparing and implementing localised national Disaster Risk Reduction and Management strategic action plans, multi-hazard risk assessment tools and methodologies, risk-informed development plans and investment decisions is necessary. We must increase investment in DRR and community resilience focusing on innovative and sustainable financing mechanisms such as public-private-people partnerships and forecast-based financing to strengthen disaster risk governance and community resilience. Only by changing the mindsets of stakeholders and communities can we strengthen risk-informed governance. Nepal’s disaster emergency preparedness and response need serious attention from the government, communities and individuals. Their concerted efforts in implementing a proactive and risk-informed approach can significantly improve preparedness and response capabilities. This will ultimately safeguard lives, property and livelihoods from the devastating impacts of floods.

They provided valuable insights into the state of local governance under federalism. This article captures their perspectives, highlighting the successes and obstacles encountered as local governments adapt to Nepal’s evolving federal structure.Pokhara’s mayor Acharya expressed frustration with the perception of local government as mere administrative extensions rather than fully empowered entities. He lamented that local governments have authority over basic services like education and healthcare, yet they face constant resistance from employees unwilling to recognise their jurisdiction. Additionally, the persistence of District Coordination Committees and federal control over resources, such as drinking water and local infrastructure, continues to blur authority and accountability. For Pokhara, a tourism capital, he envisioned support from both federal and provincial levels to realise its full potential. He also noted that without proper intergovernmental coordination, such ambitions remain challenging.In a similar vein, Chairperson Krishna Bahadur Thapaliya of Benighat Rorang Rural Municipality, Dhading, voiced concerns over federalism’s sustainability. Reflecting on the sacrifices of the past, Thapaliya remarked, “We fought for this structure, but educated elites seem to distort it through convoluted interpretations.” He urged leaders to stay grounded in federalism’s original principles to prevent misinterpretations that could weaken the system. Echoing this sentiment, Dan Bahadur Gurung from the Ichchhakamana Rural Municipality of Chitwan underscored the interconnectedness of all three levels of government, stating, “Without empowering local governments, neither the provincial nor federal levels can thrive.”Dambar Bahadur BK, Chairperson of Khajura Rural Municipality in Banke, underscored the need for stable executive provincial governments and called for provincial control over administrative matters like staffing, which currently suffers due to unestablished provincial laws.For many local leaders, decentralisation and fiscal empowerment are central to the federalism debate. Dilip Kumar Rai, Mayor of Pathari Shanishchare Municipality in Morang, raised concerns about the lack of resources and autonomy despite constitutionally granted powers. He highlighted that as per the constitution, land registration should be handled locally, but this authority remains centralised. Furthermore, healthcare expansion has been hindered by budgetary constraints and workforce shortages. “In my municipality with 72,000 residents, we are restricted to a 15-bed hospital, whereas smaller local levels in other regions enjoy greater healthcare facilities,” Rai noted. He stressed that budgeting should reflect population and need, not rigid allocations set without local input.For Nagesh Koirala, Mayor of Biratnagar, the question of provincial relevance is as critical as environmental conservation in Nepal’s Chure region. In response to questions about the viability of federalism, Koirala argued that provinces are integral to governance, likening them to essential ecological systems. “Provinces must remain as pillars of local governance,” he asserted, adding that development programmes should be seen as long-term investments rather than temporary projects. He highlighted that federal and provincial policies must better align with local priorities, suggesting that overemphasising centralised decision-making stifles local autonomy.Nim Bahadur KC, Chairperson of Darma Rural Municipality, Salyan, highlighted fiscal transfers as a significant change but argued that federalism’s survival requires more support for local governance. He expressed concerns over the federal government’s reluctance to transfer administrative authority and reduce fiscal equalisation grants, which weakens fiscal stability at the local level.In Bheri Ganga Municipality, Surkhet, Mayor Yagya Prasad Dhakal pointed out that federalism has no alternative if Nepal aims to achieve good governance and prosperity. He proposed that the federal government focus on national and international affairs, provinces on infrastructure and development and local governments on service delivery. Dhakal argued that mayors need adequate political connections to operate effectively and noted the imbalance in local powers, where municipalities have local police, but provinces lack provincial police forces.Several leaders raised concerns over budgeting and revenue collection constraints. Meena Kumari Lama, Mayor of Hetauda sub-metropolitan city shared the challenges of expanding the local tax base and maintaining good governance amid clashes with contractors and illegal activities. She contended that the lack of a proper fiscal federalism mechanism has hindered the delivery of services and development goals. Sher Bahadur Shahi, Chairperson of Shivalaya Rural Municipality in Jajarkot, voiced concern over the practical implementation of federalism, particularly in the underdeveloped Karnali Province. Shahi criticised the inadequate budget allocation for provincial projects, noting that funds provided are insufficient to address local infrastructure needs, such as purchasing essential supplies like pipelines. He questioned the federal government’s focus, suggesting it seems out of touch with provincial realities and needs.Moreover, many mayors emphasised the importance of federal and provincial collaboration to address local needs and strengthen the country’s federal structure. Vaikuntha Neupane, Mayor of Byas Municipality Tanahun, highlighted the inefficiencies resulting from centralised processes, remarking that local governments still lack essential resources, such as legal officers, for effective administration. This administrative shortfall, he argued, has constrained Nepal’s ability to implement federalism effectively. According to Neupane, the federal government must prioritise local capacity-building to achieve meaningful progress.Rajan Paudel, Mayor of Jitpur Simara Submetropolitan City, suggested a fundamental rethink of federalism implementation. He called on federal authorities to ensure local governments can exercise constitutionally granted rights. “We are the closest to the people,” Paudel said. “Our role is to assess service delivery and local development outcomes that directly impact lives.” This sentiment was echoed by Manoj Kumar Sah, Mayor of Janakpurdham Sub-Metropolitan City, who stressed that questioning federalism’s validity undermines Nepal’s progress. Sah highlighted the need to enforce rights granted to local governments, such as employee management, local law enforcement and public trust in the federal system.For Jawaharlal Yadav, Chairperson of the National Association of Rural Municipalities in Madhesh Provincial Committee, the struggle for federalism and local empowerment goes hand in hand. Yadav pointed out that many government services, from agriculture to tourism, remain tied to the federal level, leading to inefficiencies and limited local impact. “The federal government has retained authority over essential services like agriculture and education that local governments should manage,” Yadav stated.The journey of federalism in Nepal stands at a crossroads, demanding the active engagement of all levels of government, political leaders, policymakers, administrators and citizens. Local government representatives have voiced a clear vision for empowered governance that genuinely reflects the needs of their communities. As Nepal continues this transformative process, federal, provincial and local governments must align to foster accountability, unity and a shared commitment to realising the full potential of federalism. Collective action and sustained support can help Nepal build a federal system that meets the aspirations of its people and enhances the nation’s path toward inclusive development and prosperity.

As Nepal continues this transformative process, federal, provincial and local governments must align to foster accountability, unity and a shared commitment to realising the full potential of federalism. Collective action and sustained support can help Nepal build a federal system that meets the aspirations of its people and enhances the nation’s path toward inclusive development and prosperity.

But better sense prevailed, they took to the field again, and then went on to register one of the most memorable victories in the annals of Nepali sports. What was impressive was not just the spectacular victory of our women’s national team against India, the five-time champions, 4-2 on penalties, but also their manifest sportsmanship despite being at the end of some very iffy refereeing decisions.India has always been a formidable team, and this was only the second time our ladies had defeated the southern juggernaut. Although India must have anticipated a competitive match after their 1-0 defeat to Nepal in the tournament’s last edition, surely, they couldn’t have foreseen such a massive turnout of Nepali supporters eager to witness their women players take the field. This, combined with Nepal’s compact defence holding strong despite being down to 10 players, left the Indians formless after the second-half pause, which lasted over an hour following Preeti Kulung Rai’s disallowed equaliser to India’s Sangita Basfore’s 30-yard goal.The umpiring team’s decision to rule out Nepal’s goal following the referee’s restart while the Indians were celebrating Basfore’s strike sparked widespread criticism. The Nepali team had the right to protest; a goal cannot be disallowed after the referee restarts a match. The enraged crowd threw bottles and shouted, “Referee out,” alerting the security personnel in the overflowing stadium. In time, things calmed down and the Nepali women decided to fight back. The star players were Sabitra Bhandari, “Samba,” who scored the equalising goal as well as a penalty kick, and Anjana Rana Magar, the keeper who saved two penalties. The resilience and determination the national women’s team showed on the field touched every Nepali. Yes, the times are changing, and female players are finally getting the appreciation they deserve. However, the country should aim higher. The monthly salary for the women’s team is only around 30,000 per player as of August 2024. Nor do women get many chances to play domestically. Given the inability to earn in Nepal, many players go abroad in search of better opportunities. Likewise, while male footballers are busy playing several national-level leagues around the year, women’s leagues rarely take place and are poorly managed. In terms of prize money, men are usually rewarded with huge cash prizes, whereas the amounts are substantially less for women. Samba, the all-time highest-scoring footballer in Nepal and the only Nepali to play and score in a European league, was discovered by a National team referee in her home district’s women’s football tournament when she was 16. Other female footballers have similar stories. So having more grassroots leagues and tournaments that bring out hidden talents is vital to encourage women. Now, all eyes will be on our ladies who face Bangladesh in the finals today. The absence of Rekha Poudel, Samba’s attacking partner, will be felt as Bangladesh is a strong opponent we failed to defeat last time. But again, win or lose, the Nepali women’s fortitude and sportsmanship displayed last Sunday have already won the hearts of millions of Nepali football fans. They will be happy today so long as the Nepali team gives its 100 percent.  ","summary":"No matter what happens in the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) women’s championship at the Dashrath Rangasala today, Nepali football has already won.

He again accused the Oli government of protecting the corrupt while selectively targeting opposition leaders for prosecution. Dahal re-emphasised how his government was toppled because it was preparing to take action against top Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders on corruption charges. Dahal and other top Maoist leaders who spoke before him lamented the ‘complete failure’ of the Oli government’s 100 days in office. Perhaps the most interesting part of Dahal’s statement was that the ruling parties need not fear that the Maoist Centre would try to topple the government. In fact, the party was now in a soul-searching phase and there was no question of the Maoists joining the government soon. That the Maoist supremo managed to say all this with a perfectly straight face speaks volumes about his chameleon-like ability to deceive folks—or at least about his belief that he can continue to do so indefinitely. His harangue on Saturday made one thing clear though: He still feels deeply hurt by the ‘deceit’ of KP Sharma Oli who ditched him to join hands with the Congress in order to cobble together a new ruling coalition. Nevermind that there is perhaps no one better at the deceit game than Dahal, who only four months ago used to publicly boast of the ‘magic number’ he had to be a long-term prime minister, apparently by endlessly playing off the Congress and the UML against each other. As Dahal held forth on Saturday, the pain of unexpectedly being booted out of office was also pasted all over his face. If Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba or UML chair Oli offered him to be the prime minister again, he would accept the offer in a heartbeat. No one is fooled by his commitment to soul-searching. He has played that card before. Even when he became the prime minister for the third time back in December 2022, he had promised to learn from his past mistakes and this time train all his focus on good governance and service delivery. Yet when we look back at his year and half of premiership, there is little to show for it.It is nothing but self-deception if Dahal believes people still heed his public utterances. Nothing he said on Saturday will change the public perception that Dahal is an ace manipulator whose sole goal is to connive his way back to power. Otherwise, it is hard to see how the Maoists can make a political comeback. Dahal continues to run the party like a personal fief. His successor as party chair is nowhere in sight. The party’s popular base continues to shrink and on current course, the outfit might be obliterated in the next election cycle. When the Maoist leader thundered from Tundikhel in the past, a sizable section of farmers, labourers, daily wage earners and all those who yearned for a break with the past paid some attention. Unlike the ‘bourgeois’ Congress and UML, the Maoists, with some justification, claimed to have championed the cause of the downtrodden. Now the very proposition sounds laughable. The Maoist Centre these days is a party without a core ideology or stable support base. With Dahal uninterested in putting in the hard work to gradually rebuild the organisation while champing at the bit to get back into Singhadurbar, the Maoists’ downslide will be hard to halt.  ","summary":"While addressing party workers in Kathmandu on Saturday, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition, stuck to a familiar script.

He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  ","summary":"Former chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle.

He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance.

The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance.

At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies.

Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. ","summary":"Nepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential.

The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority.
