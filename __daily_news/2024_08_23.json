Dozens of victims even staged a sit-in in New Baneshwar, near the Parliament premises, to pressure upper house members to endorse the bill only after necessary changes in the provisions that they claim undermine the quest for justice.However, their appeal went unheard as the upper chamber passed the bill without going into the revision process. The House of Representatives had forwarded the bill to the Assembly after endorsing it on August 14. Along with some victim’s groups from the 1996-2006 insurgency, three international human rights organisations and the National Human Rights Commission have expressed their reservations to some provisions of the bill.The constitutional human rights watchdog is particularly unhappy with the provision of reducing 75 percent sentencing even in serious violations of human rights. It allows the attorney general to lodge the case demanding just 25 percent of action as per the existing law.“It is inappropriate to give sweeping authority to the attorney general to reduce the sentencing while filing cases,” Surya Dhungel, a member of the National Human Rights Commission, told the Post.He is also against the provision for extending the terms of the commission beyond four years. The bill gives four years to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of the Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons, with provisions for conditional extension.The National Assembly will forward the bill to the lower house, which then will dispatch it to the Office of the President for authentication.

Along with the reservation in the reduced sentencing, they say the definition of serious violations of human rights is not consistent with international law and excludes other serious crimes. They claimed that the prohibition of torture and the need for its criminalisation are absolute; there can be no qualification for “inhuman or cruel” torture, since torture, by nature, is inhuman or cruel.The Supreme Court in 2015 had struck down several amnesty provisions in the Act, terming them unconstitutional and in violation of Nepal’s international human rights obligations. While the new bill contains several significant improvements and positive provisions, parts of it again appear designed to shield those responsible for wartime crimes from prosecution.Leaders of the ruling parties have said endorsement of the bill has opened the door to expedite the transitional justice process that has been paralysed for the last two years. Both the commissions have been without their office bearers since July 2022. Though former chief justice Om Prakash Mishra-led panel has been constituted to recommend candidates for the two commissions, it is yet to start work as the human rights commission has refused to send its representatives saying that the Act needs to be amended first.Along with human rights activists, the victims also claim that how the transitional justice process moves ahead will depend on the kind of persons that will be appointed to the commissions.

The government has given ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, a three-month deadline to comply with certain terms and conditions.“The government has decided to allow TikTok to resume operations, but under certain conditions,” said Prithvi Subba Gurung, minister for Communication and Information Technology.As per Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s instruction to treat all social media equally, and to formulate necessary laws and regulations, the ministry prepared a proposal that led to the decision, Gurung said.TikTok is now required to fulfil four conditions before it can resume operations in Nepal. “Now onwards, TikTok has to help promote Nepal's tourism; invest in digital literacy efforts; support to uplift Nepal's public education system; and be mindful of the language used on its platform,” said Gurung outlining the conditions.“After TikTok assured the government that it would fulfil these conditions, we decided in principle to allow TikTok to resume operations in Nepal,” he added. Gurung said that all social media platforms, not just TikTok, must comply with the rules and regulations. “They cannot allow content that disrupts social harmony.”On August 8, the prime minister had held a meeting with Minister Gurung and senior officials from several government agencies to discuss the issue.The ban was first imposed on November 13 by the then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government citing concerns about TikTok’s negative impact on society.Observers say the TikTok issue is part of a broader global geopolitical struggle between the US and China.About two weeks ago, TikTok's South Asia division emailed Minister Gurung some two weeks ago, requesting that the ban be lifted and assuring compliance with all of the country’s rules and regulations. After internal discussions and negotiations with TikTok, the Singapore-based company agreed to the conditions, a senior official at the prime minister's office said. “Following this, the government decided to lift the ban.”The government restricted TikTok after introducing the ‘Directives on the Operation of Social Networking 2023’ in November last year.The directives require social media sites such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube, among others, to set up liaison offices in Nepal.The government had said that this measure was introduced in response to an increasing number of complaints from users. The absence of these companies’ representatives in Nepal had made it difficult for the authorities to address users’ concerns and remove objectionable content from these platforms.The directives also set forth a 19-point not-to-do list for users on platforms like Facebook, X, TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.The directives state that no one should create fake IDs on social media or share or make comments through such IDs. Likewise, people should not post any text, audio, video or picture that spreads hatred against any gender, community, caste, religion, profession, or people from any particular group.The directives also ban posts that promote illegal activities such as child labour, human trafficking, child marriage, or polygamy.According to the officials, in recent communications, the Policy Committee Division of South Asia office of TikTok has expressed its commitment to follow all the rules and regulations and comply with the conditions set by the government of Nepal. This led the government to reconsider and eventually lift the ban. Earlier TikTok had sent seven letters to the Nepal government, requesting the ban be lifted.In the letter, TikTok said that the ban was causing financial losses both to the company and the country.After the ban, many people started using virtual private networks (VPNs) to bypass local censorship. But gradually, most of them have switched to Facebook and Instagram Reels, which also allow users to create and upload video clips.A VPN establishes a secure connection between a user’s device and a remote server operated by a VPN provider. This creates an encrypted tunnel that masks the user’s internet protocol address, protecting personal data and allowing them to bypass website blocks and firewalls.Internet service providers said that TikTok accounts for nearly 40 percent of internet bandwidth consumption in Nepal. Even after the ban, overall internet usage did not decline as many users continued to use VPNs.Before the ban, there were around 2.2 million TikTok users in Nepal, according to the Internet Service Providers’ Association of Nepal.Following the government decision, two telecommunications service providers—Nepal Telecom and Ncell—along with more than 30 internet service providers blocked TikTok.The former government's decision to ban TikTok was widely criticised by experts and the public, who cited it as an attack on freedom of expression and speech.Internet experts said that it is difficult to ban technology entirely. People often find alternative ways to access service, so a complete ban is counterproductive. Instead, they suggested that the government should focus on implementing ‘regulatory technology’ or RegTech.RegTech is the use of information technology to enhance regulatory and compliance processes.

Failing to operate regular international flights from the airport, the authorities are now using it for domestic flights. Therefore, successive governments in Nepal requested the Chinese side to convert the loan into a grant, multiple times in the past as well. Responding to a lawmaker’s query, former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, while addressing a meeting of the House of Representatives in March, had said that diplomatic efforts were underway to convert the loan received from China into grant.He had told lawmakers that during his China visit there had been ‘an agreement in principle’ for operating international flights from China to Pokhara. “I believe some international flights will arrive in Pokhara and the problem will be resolved soon,” Dahal had assured lawmakers.

Landslides blocked some of the major highways while several settlements, mainly in the southern plain, have been flooded.More than 800 families have been displaced as floods triggered by heavy rains inundated several settlements in Kailali, a western Tarai district in Sudurpaschim Province. Bhajani Municipality is hardest hit by the inundation. As per the preliminary report of the municipality, around 750 families have been displaced while 4,127 families have been affected.The displaced people have been staying on the Postal Highway, which is higher than the ground level, by pitching tents while some others are taking shelter in schools and other community buildings.Several settlements in all nine wards of Bhajani were waterlogged as the rain-swollen Kandra, Kanda, Pathariya, Kataini and Mohana rivers breached their banks and entered the settlements. Around 75 percent of land in Bhajani has been under water since Wednesday night.Similarly, Kailari Rural Municipality, Ghodaghodi and Gauriganga municipalities have been also affected due to the floods and inundation. “My house collapsed after being submerged, and the floodwaters damaged our food grains. We have nothing to eat,” lamented Mahanu Chaudhary of Khonpur in ward 3 of Kailari. Chaudhary’s family is currently staying with relatives.Security personnel rescued 16 people who were trapped in the floods in Kailari and Gauriganga. According to Chief District Officer Dharmendra Kumar Mishra, 12 people were rescued in Kailari while security personnel rescued four people in Gauriganga. The flooded Kataini river swept away Ramkrishna Chaudhari and his wife Lokmaya in Bayaspur, ward 5 of Kailari, on Wednesday evening. The Armed Police Force personnel rescued the Chaudhary couple from a tree some 500 metres downstream from the incident site.Similarly, a massive landslide blocked the Damauli-Dumre section of the Prithvi Highway at Ghansikuwa in ward 1 of Byas Municipality in Tanahun district, for 24 hours. Hundreds of passengers were stranded on the highway that connects the country’s two major cities—Kathmandu and Pokhara—for hours.The mudslide erupted from approximately 50 metres above the highway at around 5pm on Wednesday. “Following the relentless efforts, single-lane traffic resumed along the road section from 5:40pm on Thursday,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Deepak Kumar Raya.The security personnel and employees of the road division office started clearing the debris early in the morning, but the sheer scale of the landslide caused significant delays in reopening the road.Earlier, the authorities urged motorists to use alternative routes. Small and medium vehicles have been advised to take a detour through Damauli to Talghare and rejoin the highway via Ranigaun, or alternatively, take the Ranigaun-Ghansikuwa route towards Dumre, Tanahun.Likewise, a landslide disrupted transportation along the Dumre-Besisahar road section on Thursday. The landslide at Ramailodanda in ward 1 of Bhanu Municipality blocked the road section at around 1pm. The traffic was diverted through Bhansar-Nareshworta-Armed Police Force Battalion road section.Similarly, the Dang-Salyan-Surkhet and the Kapurkot-Phalawang roads under the Madan Bhandari Highway have been blocked since Thursday morning due to landslides triggered by continuous rainfall.According to the District Police Office, Salyan, a landslide at Tateli in ward 4 of Kalimati Rural Municipality has blocked the Dang-Salyan-Surkhet road, while the Kapurkot-Phalawang road has been obstructed at Kimuchaur after the road was swept away by the landslide.A team of security personnel has been deployed to the site to clear the debris and restore traffic movement, said Police Inspector Resham Bahadur Khatri, the information officer at the District Police Office, Salyan.Efforts are ongoing to reopen the blocked roads, but continuous rainfall and difficult terrain are hampering the progress. Authorities have urged travellers to avoid the affected routes until the situation is resolved.In Darchula, residents of Kotila settlement in ward 4 of Mallikarjun Rural Municipality are hugely affected after a landslide damaged a drinking water project on Monday. According to Pawan Singh Dhami, a local resident, the landslide damaged the Kotila Lifting Drinking Water Project. “The settlement is experiencing a severe shortage of drinking water. The villagers have to walk for hours to find drinking water,” said Dhami.It started raining heavily in various parts of the country on Tuesday night. The Meteorological Forecasting Division says that the monsoon trough's axis, which shifted north of its normal position (close to Nepal), has been driving continuous rainfall across the country since Tuesday night. Additionally, a low-pressure area or cyclonic circulation that has formed near Pokhara further contributed to the continuous rainfall. Around 200 people have died and dozens have been injured in rain-related incidents—landslides, floods, lightning strikes, and others since the start of the monsoon on June 10 this year.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year southwest monsoon entered Nepal on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than the normal onset date.A normal monsoon, supported by the timely arrival of rain, translates into favourable agricultural production, mainly of paddy, and is further linked with the country’s overall economic growth.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s annual rainfall, generally lasts 105 days. However, in recent years, its withdrawal has taken more time.The Met Office has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events, such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.The department’s climate section has issued a weather forecast for four months, from June to September. It said most parts of the country will likely experience above-average minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall due to weakened El Nino conditions and the development of La Nina conditions.El Nino refers to climatic patterns in which ocean surface temperatures warm unusually. La Nina is the opposite, in which the ocean surface cools off.Data from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology show that the country has already received around 80 percent of the average rainfall for the entire monsoon season this year.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius yearly.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority estimates that the monsoon will affect 1.81 million people and 412,000 households this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly impacted, and 18,000 families will require rescue due to monsoon-related disasters.(With inputs from our local correspondents) ","summary":"Heavy monsoon rains disrupted life in several districts over the past two days. Landslides blocked some of the major highways while several settlements, mainly in the southern plain, have been flooded.More than 800 families have been displaced as floods triggered by heavy rains inundated several settlements in Kailali, a western Tarai district in Sudurpaschim Province. Bhajani Municipality is hardest hit by the inundation. As per the preliminary report of the municipality, around 750 families have been displaced while 4,127 families have been affected.The displaced people have been staying on the Postal Highway, which is higher than the ground level, by pitching tents while some others are taking shelter in schools and other community buildings.Several settlements in all nine wards of Bhajani were waterlogged as the rain-swollen Kandra, Kanda, Pathariya, Kataini and Mohana rivers breached their banks and entered the settlements. Around 75 percent of land in Bhajani has been under water since Wednesday night.Similarly, Kailari Rural Municipality, Ghodaghodi and Gauriganga municipalities have been also affected due to the floods and inundation. “My house collapsed after being submerged, and the floodwaters damaged our food grains. We have nothing to eat,” lamented Mahanu Chaudhary of Khonpur in ward 3 of Kailari. Chaudhary’s family is currently staying with relatives.Security personnel rescued 16 people who were trapped in the floods in Kailari and Gauriganga. According to Chief District Officer Dharmendra Kumar Mishra, 12 people were rescued in Kailari while security personnel rescued four people in Gauriganga.

But more often than not, it is because our drivers are overworked, and there is hardly any solid monitoring mechanism in place to check their physical and mental status. Providing resting time for drivers becomes even more crucial during monsoons, when landslides obstruct roads and the journeys become longer.Realising the need to provide drivers with resting time and place, the Lumbini Province Government started building five “smart refresh centres” in Bardaghat in Nawalparasi West, Sainamaina in Rupandehi, Chandrauta in Kapilvastu, Lamahi in Dang, and Bardiya along the East-West Highway four years ago. These centres promise washrooms, eateries, restrooms, shower rooms, charging stations, parking area, among other amenities, to help drivers and passengers tackle fatigue during long-distance travels. However, due to budget constraints, the project hasn’t seen the light of day yet. While the idea of starting the refresh centres is laudable, there is a clear lack of coordination among political parties to complete the project. The ambitious project took shape in Lumbini during the CPN-UML government when it set aside around Rs110 million. But the government was ousted even as it began construction work, and the new government, led by the Maiosts, slashed the budget for the project. The project got shelved by subsequent governments. Even though the first phase of the project (only the construction of the building) has been completed in Sainamaina, its operation has been halted as it lacks proper guidelines for functioning. The experiment in Lumbini has been a failed project.Nepal’s Motor Vehicle and Transport Management Act mandates drivers to rest after six hours of driving. However, the authorities have failed to enforce the rules, let alone arrange proper rest areas for the drivers. Safer roads not only improve road safety but also help the country's tourism flourish. As we strive to expand our tourism agenda by attracting more tourists, the importance of ensuring basic resting facilities along the highways cannot be overstated. Providing the best services for tourists will attract them to the country, thereby boosting our economy and buttressing international reputation. While it is encouraging that several other provinces have rest centres along highways, the conditions are far from decent. Most of these centres lack basic sanitary and hygiene services. Moreover, such small projects lack sufficient construction as well as maintenance funds, as has been the case in Lumbini. The governments’ tendency to consider them “trivial” is equally concerning. Such a mindset not only hinders our journey towards making roads safer but also other opportunities that come along with it, including tourism promotion and passenger satisfaction. As highway accidents become a regular phenomenon in Nepal, we need more smart refresh centres. The federal government should therefore come on board and help provincial and local governments construct these centres through enough budget allocation on need basis. It is also necessary to devise a plan to maintain and renovate existing ones that lack enough amenities for drivers and passengers. Meanwhile, political parties should heed the projects that are in the best interests of people, and not weigh them on the basis of whether they fall under their party’s priority or not. ","summary":"Our roads are becoming increasingly unsafe due to poor and haphazard construction, natural disasters. But more often than not, it is because our drivers are overworked, and there is hardly any solid monitoring mechanism in place to check their physical and mental status. Providing resting time for drivers becomes even more crucial during monsoons, when landslides obstruct roads and the journeys become longer.Realising the need to provide drivers with resting time and place, the Lumbini Province Government started building five “smart refresh centres” in Bardaghat in Nawalparasi West, Sainamaina in Rupandehi, Chandrauta in Kapilvastu, Lamahi in Dang, and Bardiya along the East-West Highway four years ago. These centres promise washrooms, eateries, restrooms, shower rooms, charging stations, parking area, among other amenities, to help drivers and passengers tackle fatigue during long-distance travels. However, due to budget constraints, the project hasn’t seen the light of day yet. While the idea of starting the refresh centres is laudable, there is a clear lack of coordination among political parties to complete the project. The ambitious project took shape in Lumbini during the CPN-UML government when it set aside around Rs110 million. But the government was ousted even as it began construction work, and the new government, led by the Maiosts, slashed the budget for the project. The project got shelved by subsequent governments. Even though the first phase of the project (only the construction of the building) has been completed in Sainamaina, its operation has been halted as it lacks proper guidelines for functioning. The experiment in Lumbini has been a failed project.Nepal’s Motor Vehicle and Transport Management Act mandates drivers to rest after six hours of driving. However, the authorities have failed to enforce the rules, let alone arrange proper rest areas for the drivers. Safer roads not only improve road safety but also help the country's tourism flourish. As we strive to expand our tourism agenda by attracting more tourists, the importance of ensuring basic resting facilities along the highways cannot be overstated. Providing the best services for tourists will attract them to the country, thereby boosting our economy and buttressing international reputation. While it is encouraging that several other provinces have rest centres along highways, the conditions are far from decent. Most of these centres lack basic sanitary and hygiene services. Moreover, such small projects lack sufficient construction as well as maintenance funds, as has been the case in Lumbini. The governments’ tendency to consider them “trivial” is equally concerning.

Vulnerability arises from governance crises, elites’ incompatibility with basic democratic rule, and all kinds of human frailties developed by rulers’ irrational behaviours and myopic decisions. Commonly, resistance to misrule and elected leaders’ absurdities create conditions for systemic and extra-systemic changes or revolutions. The crisis of legitimacy in all its manifestations works against the longevity of governments. Apart from the electoral legitimacy that helps form a government, psychological legitimacy, a part of performance legitimacy, makes situations more fertile for mass rebellion.Small incidents or faulty decisions the leaders make prepare grounds for major upheavals.

They revolted against the Sheikh Hasina government’s decision to implement the 30 percent reservation quota for the children of liberation fighters—Muktibahinini, perceived as the Awami League Party members.Legitimacy crisisPolitical awareness has both positive and negative sides. A ruler’s positive picture provides governmental stability, whereas an egregious picture fuels instability. Popular consciousness holds governments accountable. Any democratic government that ignores widespread sensitivity and rights loses its moral ground. Thomas Hill Green, a political philosopher, writes, “Human consciousness postulates liberty, liberty involves rights, rights demand the state”. According to him, the state is organic to the elements of consciousness and rights, and the state must “hinder the hindrances” that come in the way of liberty. John Locke, much before Green, gave people the right to revolt if the government failed to be legitimate and responsible for protecting their rights. Thus, democracy is as attractive a concept and practice as it is impregnated with seeds of movement. Holding periodic elections, along with the design of power separation, is for controlling disruption or breakdown of government or even the political system. Elections, too, demand people’s consciousness because they are expected to circulate elites to provide a safety valve for the system. If different methods and excuses plunder the elections, the scope for extreme actions becomes inevitable. Many instances in South Asia, Latin America and Africa have proved that legitimacy claimed on the grounds of electoral victory alone is weird, as people rise to revolt sooner or later if leaders fail to be sensitive. A few days ago, the Colombian president was forced to resign when his legitimacy grounds became suspect. Democracy contains the sparkle of fire that needs to be carefully handled. Movements are violent and non-violent, and their methods vary depending on their very nature. Democracy produced by violent upheavals is short-lived, as it is fraught with uncertain elements and is not conducive to the smooth functioning of a political system. Moreover, in countries where rulers and systems are organic to each other—arguing that one is exclusive to the other—the fall of rulers would also be the fall of the regime. In Nepal, the monarchy was identified with the regime's endurance created by the king. When people revolted against the regime, the monarchy became weak despite the king’s confidence that his grip on power would not dwindle, even when the people rejected the Panchayat system. As King Gyanendra failed to fathom the anger and resentment of people against his authoritarian proclivities, both the monarchy and the regime collapsed.South Asian democratic crisesIn Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, people involved in the movement seemed to be sensitive to the cause of democracy. In addition to rooting out the system, they also didn’t allow the army to wield power after the ouster of leaders Sheikh Hasina and Gotabaya Rajapaksha. They soon displayed their maturity in realising the need for communal harmony and peace despite the vandalisation of Hindu temples and houses of minority communities in Bangladesh. The choice of a scholar, Professor Muhammad Yunus, in spite of his animosity with Hasina, augured well from a democratic point of view. Bangladesh, like Sri Lanka, is expected to return to electoral politics and maintain constitutional order soon. However, the agitators and other parties must learn a lesson: Winning elections by foul means would be dangerous. Hasina’s greatest failure was to concentrate power in her own hands, depriving her political rivals of the fight for election. She used draconian methods to decimate opposition. Her decent track record of faster economic development, making Bangladesh a development model for South Asia, has been overshadowed by her authoritarian governance style. Nevertheless, Hasina’s party is likely to continue to be a significant force because of its long history and tradition, which gave birth to the Republic of Bangladesh. South Asian countries, in general, have demonstrated that any form of authoritarian dictatorship is not a substitute for democracy. The military in Pakistan might have continued to play politics from behind; there, too, the civilian’s share of power is not absent. However, it is assumed that in any system, democratic or authoritarian, the military, which is one of the core elements of national security, shows its influence in politics. Although the elected government is supreme in India, it has to consult the army while making vital security decisions. In South Asia, democracy suffers from parties and politicians whose minimum moral standards are blurred, causing them to be highly self-centred and parochial in running the system. In Nepal, bad image projections of leaders are fraught with the danger of being overturned by quick events, as in the past. People easily link external factors with political upheavals in countries of the region. However, the governance crisis and negative image of leaders seem crucial for electoral defeats or government toppling. Hasina’s allegation that the US was behind the movement against her is untenable, despite her not-too-friendly relationship with the country. Her view that the US wanted to use St Martin’s Island and the Bay of Bengal for security purposes lacks veracity and cannot be the sole reason for her ouster.

Just like in most places in the subcontinent, on the night of August 8, on-duty doctors at the RG Kar Hospital in Kolkata in India were also watching Arshad Nadeem and Niraj Chopra compete against each other. A lot was at stake and India was the favourite. We all know what happened in the competition, as Pakistan won its first individual Olympic gold medal.However, nobody, it seems, knows what happened at the RG Kar Hospital. It has been two weeks since the news broke that a trainee doctor who was on duty that night was brutally raped and killed in the early hours of August 9. Ever since then, Kolkata and many other Indian cities have been in a state of turmoil. Out-Patient Department services have been suspended in several hospitals in the country and questions are being raised about how such a brutal crime could have taken place in a fully staffed hospital.According to news reports, the second-year resident was completing a 36-hour shift at the hospital and was attacked while she was apparently resting in a seminar room. The doctor’s parents were not called until much later. They were first informed in a telephone call that their daughter was very sick. They were later told that their daughter had died by suicide. When the shocked and panicked parents arrived at the hospital, they were prevented from seeing their daughter’s body for four hours.When finally they were allowed to see their child’s body, they saw that she had been beaten and badly bruised. The glass from her spectacles had been smashed on her face and even her eyes were bleeding from the shards. The postmortem report, that hinted at gang-rape, was horrifying, and said that the victim had been strangled to death. Suspecting a move to destroy evidence, the father of the rape victim questioned the haste with which the body of his child was cremated.The incident is brutal and horrifying and it brings to the fore a safety problem that has also been faced by working women in Pakistan. Doctors, including women doctors, work long hours in very difficult circumstances—whether they are at the understaffed wards at government hospitals in the cities or in far-flung areas where amenities are few and living conditions difficult.Doctors, including those with labour-room responsibilities, have to work at all hours of the day and night and may be singlehandedly responsible for dozens of patients at the same time. The situation is made more complicated by the fact that patients are often accompanied by entire crews of family members. If something goes awry or the patient passes away, one doctor is left to face a crowd of angry family members. While such a situation can be faced by both male and female doctors, the latter category is more vulnerable in a patriarchal society, where misogyny and gender discrimination are par for the course.Medical premises in Pakistan are often not equipped with safe and adequate facilities for female doctors whether these are bathrooms or rooms where female medical staff working long hours can rest safely. This means that women doctors, who are already a target of aggression in the wards, are unable to feel safe even outside them.In the Kolkata case, the person who has been arrested was a civilian police volunteer, who appears to have had easy access to all parts of the hospital. The same conditions apply to many hospitals in Pakistan where people have easy access to all parts of medical premises, thus posing a potential threat to women doctors and nurses.It is understandable why the medical community in India is on the streets protesting against the rape and the conditions that led to it. Unsurprisingly, as time passes, the matter is being given a political colour because the ruling Modi administration—which has done nothing to make working conditions safe for women in the country—wants to undermine the state government in West Bengal whose capital Kolkata is. However, the issue is not one of politics or the government’s ineptitude but rather a wider culture of patriarchal violence in the entire subcontinent. The fact is that women are routinely targeted, raped and forgotten in all of South Asia. Men commit these crimes because they know that most of the time they will get away with it; in fact, there will be no consequences whatsoever.One ridiculous solution that someone offered in the Kolkata case is that women doctors should not be permitted to do night duty at all. This solution seeks to further punish women who have already been held back for centuries for a variety of flawed reasons, including the belief that allowing them independence would compromise their safety vis-à-vis men with uncontrollable bestial instincts.If women anywhere in South Asia are to be safe, this kind of thinking needs to go. The root of the problem—men with depraved thoughts and capable of expressing these in the most horrific way—has to be addressed. The young doctor in Kolkata was saving lives in an under-resourced environment and at an hour where only medics can save you.

Some encouraging news brightened the country’s mood even as the overall economy remained stagnant. In June last year, Nepal and India inked a long-term power trade agreement, whereby the southern neighbour would import 10,000 MW of hydroelectricity from Nepal in 10 years. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the announcement at a joint press meet with Nepali counterpart Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was on a visit to India. Based on the same deal, India has been gradually increasing the quantum of energy it is importing from Nepal. On Monday, New Delhi approved a plan to import an additional 251 MW of electricity from Nepal, increasing the total imports to nearly 1,000 MW. Nepal, which was heavily dependent on India’s electricity until a few years ago, became a net exporter of electricity last fiscal. Encouraged by the potential market in India and other neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, investors have been injecting huge investments in this sector. Work to build transmission lines and substations has picked up in recent months. Nepal and Bangladesh were all set to sign an agreement last month on the export of Nepal’s 40 MW of electricity via India, only to be cancelled due to political unrest in the South Asian nation. Even as Nepal makes great strides in electricity production and exports, our villages still remain unelectrified. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority’s latest report, 18 of the country’s 753 local government units are not connected to the national grid. According to the NEA report published on Tuesday, 1 percent of the total population is still deprived of the basic facility. Even in the rest of the parts of the country covered by the national grid, electricity supply is still erratic. Moreover, while the import of electric vehicles (EVs) is rising, exhibiting a keen interest among Nepalis to switch from fossil fuel to electricity, the government doesn’t seem to be keeping pace. While it is yet to build the infrastructure for electric vehicles, including charging stations, its policy on import and sales of such vehicles isn’t consistent. Another important area where the government should concentrate its efforts on is increasing the consumption of electricity in the kitchens of Nepalis across the country. The ministry of energy should devise some attractive schemes to replace cooking gas with electric stoves. Authorities don’t seem to be seriously working on these fronts. Instead, the government at times looks derailed. At a time when it needs to expedite work to replace fossil fuel-based activities with electricity, the government is preparing to build oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa, a greenfield tank terminal in Charali, and an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan with India’s support.Promoting electricity and fossil fuel usage at the same time, the government seems to be trying to have it both ways. This approach is wrong approach. What the government should do is to formulate a clear policy of promoting clean energy-based activities and formulate a comprehensive plan on energy production and consumption. That should be guided by the approach of increasing domestic consumption and exporting surplus production. This strategy has multiple benefits. Replacement of the huge quantity of imported fossil fuels with electricity saves billions of rupees, helps rejuvenate the country’s economy and decarbonises the transport and other sectors.

The Indian community accorded a very warm welcome,” Modi wrote on X. The Ukrainian railways company showed footage of him stepping off a train carriage and being received by Ukrainian officials.In the run-up to the trip, he said he was looking forward to sharing “perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict”.Modi’s visit to Moscow last month coincided with a heavy Russian missile strike on Ukraine that hit a children’s hospital. The attack prompted Modi to use emotive language to deliver an implicit rebuke to Putin at their summit.But the trip elicited fierce criticism from Zelenskiy who said it was a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day”.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser in the Ukrainian president’s office, told Reuters Modi’s visit to Kyiv was significant because New Delhi “really has a certain influence” over Moscow.“It’s extremely important for us to effectively build relations with such countries, to explain to them what the correct end to the war is - and that it is also in their interests,” he said.India, which has traditionally had close economic and defence ties with Moscow, has publicly criticised the deaths of innocent people in the war.But it has also strengthened its economic ties with Moscow after Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia and cut trade relations with it over the invasion.Indian refiners which rarely bought Russian oil in the past have emerged as Moscow’s top clients for sea-borne oil since Russia poured troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

So many innocent lives lost, desperate hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking,” she said.“President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”In some of her strongest foreign policy statements to date, Harris said she would take whatever action was necessary to defend US interests against Iran and would not cosy up to tyrants and dictators.She said such leaders, including North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, “are rooting for Trump.”She vowed to stand with Ukraine in its war against Russia and with NATO allies.HARRIS WOULD BE FIRST FEMALE US PRESIDENTIf successful, Harris stands to make history as the first woman elected US president.She described the November 5 election as a “precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past. A chance to chart a New Way Forward.”Harris drew a series of contrasts with Trump, accusing him of not fighting for the middle class, planning to enact a tax hike through his tariff proposals, and having set in motion the end of a constitutional right to abortion with his picks for the US Supreme Court.Harris noted the Supreme Court’s recent ruling about presidential immunity and the risks that would engender if Trump gained power again.“Just imagine Donald Trump with no guard rails,” she said.Trump, who had promised to respond to Harris’ speech in real-time, posted a series of messages on Truth Social as she spoke about him, including: “She stands for Incompetence and Weakness – Our Country is being laughed at all over the World!” and “She will never be respected by the Tyrants of the World!”FINAL NIGHTChicago’s United Center brimmed with energy – and people. The arena’s 23,500 seats were filled and arena staff briefly blocked more people from entering the facility, saying the city’s fire marshal declared the building at capacity.After Harris ended her speech, 100,000 balloons descended on the crowd, a convention official said. Inflating them took 75 volunteers, 30 staff members and a dozen unionized stagehands.Biden called Harris to wish her luck before her speech, a White House spokesperson said.On Thursday night, Harris said she will pass a middle tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans.She discussed her plans to fight for abortion rights, voting rights legislation, boost the housing supply and ban what she has called “price gouging” by grocers. Her campaign has also proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.Before the speech, thousands of Palestinian supporters once again gathered to protest US support for Israel as it wages war in Gaza. The issue is one of the most divisive among Democrats and got little attention at the convention, which could hurt Democrats at the polls.Delegates from the Uncommitted National Movement, which mobilized nearly 750,000 voters to withhold support for Biden during the presidential primaries, entered the venue linking arms and took their seats. Members spent Wednesday night on the sidewalk outside the convention to protest the DNC’s rejection of their request for a Palestinian speaker.Harris has raised a record-breaking $500 million in a month and narrowed the gap or taken the lead against Trump in many opinion polls of battleground states. Nationwide, she leads Trump 46.6% to 43.8%, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight.

But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees.

This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepal’s high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from China’s biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the world’s first drone delivery test on Everest.“After a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,” said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the world’s largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the world’s tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.“Using drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,” said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the season’s expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.“Yes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  ","summary":"Come autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest.

This shift is vividly captured in Muna Bhadel's artistic practice, whose paintings reflect her grandmother’s life and the broader implications for women in Nepal.Early marriages and familial responsibilities profoundly influenced many older female generations, including Bhadel’s grandmother. Bhadel’s artistic practice delves into her grandmother's life experiences and dreams, offering personal insight into the generational differences between older women and their younger counterparts.With her exhibition, ‘Silent Whispers’, which opened at Siddhartha Art Gallery on August 19, she hopes that young Nepali women who view her work can relate to and connect to her experiences.Bhadel shared that her grandmother was eight years old when she married her husband, who was 13. This left her grandmother with many unfulfilled dreams and repressed desires, which her granddaughter has had the chance to pursue. Her artwork, supported by an Australian Himalayan Foundation Art Award, seeks to bring this generational divide to light in a way that resonates with contemporary Nepali women.Bhadel’s recent work consists of large acrylic paintings featuring elderly Nepali women, often based on her grandmother. These paintings are distinctive due to her use of two different painting styles, which signify the separation between her grandmother and her dreams. While her grandmother is depicted in a hyper-realistic style, the rest of the scenes are in a pictorial style inspired by old Nepali and Indian Mughal/Rajput miniature paintings.In addition, the artist intentionally chooses the colours and patterns worn by the women in her paintings, adding another dimension to the meanings behind her paintings. Traditionally, clothing changes depending on a woman’s marital status, meaning that clothing can signify what stage of life a woman is in. For example, as the artist explained, when a woman is married, she usually wears red, but when she is widowed, she must wear white. In most of her paintings, her colour palette is predominantly red. One of her paintings particularly stood out to me. It features her grandmother looking downwards, longingly, out of a traditional Nepali window frame. To her right are three vertical scenes of lovers, reminiscent of a Patachitra narrative scroll.The first scene features Krishna attending to Radha’s hair, the second is a man bowing to his lover, and the third is two lovers sharing a meaningful conversation. Bhadel described these scenes as the love and intimacy that her grandmother wished she had felt from her husband and the life she wished she had had the opportunity to pursue.The painting evokes a strong sense of grief, grief over a life that never happened and experiences that were taken away before Bhadel’s grandmother was old enough to make her own decisions.In an interview, Bhadel reflected on how, just two generations later, she has experienced many freedoms that her grandmother had not—falling in love and pursuing her artistic career.The artist’s work not only honours her grandmother's journey but also serves as a broader commentary on the societal constraints that have historically limited women’s opportunities in Nepal.Early marriages restrict young girls from pursuing their education and realising their full potential. Child marriage was officially made illegal in Nepal in 1963, and the nation has one of the highest legal ages for marriage at 20 years old (or 18 with parental consent). Unfortunately, statistics reveal a mixed picture: while there has been progress in reducing child marriage rates, substantial barriers remain, particularly in rural areas where the law is harder to implement.Various women’s rights activist groups have pushed for stricter laws on child marriage and more focus on women’s education, resulting in the Nepal Government endorsing a National Strategy to End Child Marriage in Nepal by 2030 in 2016.This governmental promise is incredibly important, as a lack of autonomy over one’s body restricts freedoms in nearly every aspect of life. According to a UN study conducted in Nepal in 2016, only 47.7 percent of women aged 15-49 said that they make their own decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use, and reproductive healthcare.In partial correlation with the dropping child marriage rates, girls’ access to education has greatly increased, which is another major contributor to the generational divide that Bhadel has experienced.A study conducted in 2018 by UNESCO showed that the literacy rate of women aged 15-24 was 90.88 percent, while the literacy rate of all women ages 15+ was only 59.72 percent. This reveals a huge difference in the number of women in the new generation who have had access to schooling and have the opportunity to pursue their dreams beyond building a family. Her paintings vividly depict the unrealised dreams of women who have navigated the complexities of familial responsibilities. The contrast between realistic portrayals and imaginative Mughal-style scenes underscores the tension between personal aspirations and societal expectations. These artworks testify to the resilience and untold stories of women whose voices are often marginalised.Through her art, Bhadel emphasises the importance of understanding and learning from the older female generation’s experiences rather than simply highlighting feminist struggles. Her art memorialises personal histories rather than advocating for an avenue for societal change.With her paintings, she hopes to foster a deeper understanding among her audience, particularly younger women grappling with similar societal pressures.

","summary":"In a world shaped by technological advancements and shifting societal norms, traditional roles of women as primary caretakers have undergone significant transformation. This shift is vividly captured in Muna Bhadel's artistic practice, whose paintings reflect her grandmother’s life and the broader implications for women in Nepal.Early marriages and familial responsibilities profoundly influenced many older female generations, including Bhadel’s grandmother. Bhadel’s artistic practice delves into her grandmother's life experiences and dreams, offering personal insight into the generational differences between older women and their younger counterparts.With her exhibition, ‘Silent Whispers’, which opened at Siddhartha Art Gallery on August 19, she hopes that young Nepali women who view her work can relate to and connect to her experiences.Bhadel shared that her grandmother was eight years old when she married her husband, who was 13. This left her grandmother with many unfulfilled dreams and repressed desires, which her granddaughter has had the chance to pursue. Her artwork, supported by an Australian Himalayan Foundation Art Award, seeks to bring this generational divide to light in a way that resonates with contemporary Nepali women.Bhadel’s recent work consists of large acrylic paintings featuring elderly Nepali women, often based on her grandmother. These paintings are distinctive due to her use of two different painting styles, which signify the separation between her grandmother and her dreams. While her grandmother is depicted in a hyper-realistic style, the rest of the scenes are in a pictorial style inspired by old Nepali and Indian Mughal/Rajput miniature paintings.In addition, the artist intentionally chooses the colours and patterns worn by the women in her paintings, adding another dimension to the meanings behind her paintings. Traditionally, clothing changes depending on a woman’s marital status, meaning that clothing can signify what stage of life a woman is in. For example, as the artist explained, when a woman is married, she usually wears red, but when she is widowed, she must wear white. In most of her paintings, her colour palette is predominantly red. One of her paintings particularly stood out to me. It features her grandmother looking downwards, longingly, out of a traditional Nepali window frame. To her right are three vertical scenes of lovers, reminiscent of a Patachitra narrative scroll.The first scene features Krishna attending to Radha’s hair, the second is a man bowing to his lover, and the third is two lovers sharing a meaningful conversation.

He served as the UN's assistant secretary-general and Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF. He serves on the boards of several international and national organisations, charitable foundations, and public-private partnerships.In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Gautam discusses the impact of reading books on his diplomatic career and his self-authored books. What role did literature play in your career as a diplomat?I was a bookworm from my early childhood. When I was in middle school at Janata Vidyalaya in Tansen in the early 1960s, I used to spend several hours every day at Palpa’s historic Dhawal Pustakalaya library reading all kinds of Nepali literature and some Nepali literary magazines like Ruprekha and Madhuparka. I also wrote poems and essays in Nepali that were published in my school’s magazine. I received several awards for my writings and was given a medal as a child poet (baal-kavi) by the then District Commissioner of Palpa in 1964. During my studies at Kathmandu’s Juddhodaya Public High School and Tri-Chandra College in the mid-1960s, I spent much of my spare time visiting the American, British, Chinese, Indian and Russian libraries every day to read books as well as newspapers and magazines. By the time I finished my intermediate of arts (IA), I had read most of the books written by Laxmi Prasad Devkota, Lekhnath Paudyal, Bal Krishna Sama, Siddhicharan Shrestha, Bhim Nidhi Tiwari, Bijaya Malla ‘Gothale’, Bhupi Sherchan, among others.During my university days at Dartmouth College and Princeton University in the US, I continued to read books on various subjects ranging from literature, politics, economics and international relations. Among the books I recall reading were those by Chinua Achebe, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Leo Tolstoy, Marx, Lenin, Milovan Djilas, Edgar Snow, Han Su Yin, Pearl Buck, William Fulbright, John Kenneth Galbraith, Gunnar Myrdal, Dag Hammarskjold, among others.Reading all these books and my anti-war student activism at Dartmouth in the late 1960s and early 70s got me deeply interested in international relations and the work of the United Nations. That led to my life-long career in international diplomacy and development.You’ve written three books. What motivated you to write them, and how do they complement each other?After I retired from the UN and returned to Nepal in 2008, many Nepali friends and my UN colleagues urged me to write about my long experience in international relations and how I had risen from my humble origins in the remote village of Gulmi to a position at UNICEF and the UN. As I had tried to be helpful in Nepal’s peace process during the Maoist insurgency and following their safe landing in peaceful politics, I was also asked to reflect on my perspectives on Nepal’s contemporary political and development scenarios. I tried to write about these issues in a single volume, but the manuscript became too long. Therefore, the publishers advised me to split it into two volumes. The first volume was published as ‘Lost in Transition: Rebuilding Nepal from the Maoist Mayhem and Mega Earthquake’. It contains my views on Nepal’s political economy, including the role of our external development partners during the peace process.The second volume, ‘Global Citizen from Gulmi: My Journey from the Hills of Nepal to the Halls of the United Nations,’ is an autobiographical memoir. A third volume in Nepali, ‘Kul Chandra Gautam: AtmaKatha,’ was recently published. Besides chronicling my life's journey, this Nepali version also dwells on my views and vision for Nepal’s development. I hope these books will inspire young Nepalis to pursue their dreams of personal growth and prosperity in Nepal.You’ve seen the world through multiple lenses—as a global leader, an advocate, and an author. How does your writing process help you make sense of these different identities and experiences?I am a voracious reader but not much of a writer. I have written many UN reports on weighty subjects like child survival, global health, women’s rights, human development, and many speeches and articles on similar themes. Writing such documents required extensive reading and research. This helped me deepen my knowledge, form my views on many subjects, and hone my advocacy skills on crucial public policy issues.In my professional career, I have worked in several French and Spanish-speaking countries. To advocate in those languages, I had to familiarise myself with their unique expressions and nuances and learn their culture and customs. This was both a challenging and enriching experience that helped broaden my horizons. Thanks to this exposure, I felt as much at ease in Spanish-speaking Latin America or French-speaking West Africa and Europe as I did in the English-speaking world. My memoir is replete with accounts of my joyful experiences in those far-off continents, which helped transform me into a global citizen with deep roots in my native Nepal.Given your experiences, how do you think literature can bridge cultural divides? Have you explored this theme in your books, and if so, how?I have always felt that literature, music, art, and sports touch people’s heartstrings in ways that politics and economics can never do. Politics divides people, especially regarding ideological variety and religious faiths of self-righteous convictions. Our ancestors correctly surmised “Sahitya, sangeeta, kalaa biheena, sakshat pashu puchchha bishana heena,” which roughly translates to people who are bereft of literature, music, and art are uncultured like animals.Although I have not explicitly addressed these issues in my writings, literature does indeed help bridge cultural divides. I have witnessed this firsthand when attending literary forums like the Jaipur Literature Festival.Your books often reflect on the challenges facing Nepal’s democracy and development. As an author, how do you ensure your critical analysis is constructive and forward-looking rather than merely critical?Having lived and worked in countries with different political, ideological, and economic systems, I have learned that all human beings have the same aspirations for their children. We all want our children to live long and healthy lives and get a quality education that enables them to learn and live in a peaceful society in a clean environment that is culturally fulfilling and intellectually stimulating. If we focus on such joint “ends” rather than engaging in endless debates on the ideologically blinkered “means”, it is eminently possible to find constructive and forward-looking strategies for national development and international cooperation. As an author and development professional, I advocate for this. As someone with an abiding faith in the ideals and principles of the United Nations, I think that the broad consensus reached in the UN system on sustainable development goals, peaceful coexistence, and respect for universally agreed human rights provide a conducive framework for our national development and international relations.The last two chapters of my memoir reflect such a constructive, unifying, and forward-looking vision. They are entitled ‘My Dream for a Sundara, Shanta, Samriddha Nepal’ and ‘My Dream World—Markers of Some Momentous Changes for Humanity’.In your writings, you emphasise the importance of education and global citizenship. How do you think books and literature contribute to fostering a sense of global responsibility and awareness in today’s interconnected world?I have never seen any country achieve a high level of broad-based sustainable development without quality public education. Education opens people’s eyes to the possibility of doing things differently from what our ancestors and neighbours have done for generations.We live in an increasingly globalised world, where technological breakthroughs or political events in one part of the world directly impact the well-being of people in other parts of the world. Therefore, we must know how people in different parts of the world, who speak different languages, profess different religions and have cultural heritages that are different from ours, think and act. Only then can we compete and cooperate effectively with them.Quality education is the first step in understanding the world beyond our neighbourhood and daily life experiences. The advent of information and technology and the digital revolution have expanded our access to knowledge and skills beyond our grasp. But the fast-paced digital revolution has also brought many undesirable trends, including hate speech, disinformation, and new forms of violence online and offline.I have often found that reading books slowly and studying literature can help cultivate a sense of soberness, foster a spirit of solidarity, and teach a feeling of what our ancestors called “vasudhaiva kutumbakam”, the essence of global citizenship.Kul Chandra Gautam’s book recommendationsSapiens: A Brief History of HumankindAuthor: Yuval Noah HarariPublisher: Dvir Publishing House LtdYear: 2011This is a remarkable account of human evolution spanning thousands of years.

The government will work seriously to instill hope in the people.”At least three lawmakers raised questions about constitutional amendment to the Prime Minister. While answering their questions, Prime Minister Oli said that constitutional amendment is not a matter of courage. “We will amend the constitution taking into account the experience of eight years of its implementation,” Oli said.Meanwhile, lawmaker Narayani Sharma asked whether the current government formed with the objective of amending the constitution dares to revise the constitutional provision related to the electoral system and introduce the provision of a directly elected executive head.“Amendment of the constitution is not a matter of courage,” Oli said. “The government won’t dare to amend the constitutional provision that does not need revision, but where it is needed, the government will not hesitate to show the courage.”Likewise, Pashupati Shamsher Rana of Rastriya Prajantra Party also asked which of the articles of the constitution was the present coalition government of Nepali Congress and CPN-UML vying to amend.“There is no definite article that the present government is aiming to amend as of now,” Oli answered. “It would be determined during the amendment process and it will be done based on the discussion with the lawmakers.”Congress lawmaker Khadka had also put forth his queries related to constitution amendment.The coalition government led by Oli was formed after the seven-point agreement between Nepali Congress and CPN-UML on July 1. With the agreement between two of the largest parties in the country, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government, formed in support of UML on March 4, was unseated from the position on July 12.One of the objectives the two parties came together to form the government is to amend the constitution, leaders have said.During the quizz with the prime minister, CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker Purna Bahadur Gharti Magar raised the issue related to the State Partnership Program (SPP) and the recent visit of US Deputy Secretary of State Management and Resources Richard R Verma to Nepal.Verma was on a two-day visit to Nepal, starting on August 16. Beside vowing to continue US support to Nepal in various sectors, Verma also informed the prime minister that the US intends to support $100 million in foreign military finance to support Nepal’s rotary wing capabilities.“During the meeting with Verma, we discussed the multifaceted relations between two countries,” Oli said. “Verma said that the US will provide two helicopters to the Nepal Army.

","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has said that efforts are being made to incite people in the name of disenchantment towards the political parties.Responding to questions from lawmakers during a House of Representatives meeting on Thursday, Prime Minister Oli said that those who do not like healthy competition between the political parties or those who are dissatisfied with the current political system are trying to stir up people against the political parties and create political unrest.There have been efforts to make people more dissatisfied with the political system than they actually are, Prime Minister Oli said.Addressing Parliament before Oli, Nepali Congress lawmaker Narayan Khadka had warned the government to be cautious about the use of social media.“The current government is trying to instill hope in the people by taking everything into consideration,” Prime Minister Oli said in reply. “Positive results have started to appear in the short period of time since the formation of the government in my leadership and the current government has no excuse not to work. The government will work seriously to instill hope in the people.”At least three lawmakers raised questions about constitutional amendment to the Prime Minister. While answering their questions, Prime Minister Oli said that constitutional amendment is not a matter of courage. “We will amend the constitution taking into account the experience of eight years of its implementation,” Oli said.Meanwhile, lawmaker Narayani Sharma asked whether the current government formed with the objective of amending the constitution dares to revise the constitutional provision related to the electoral system and introduce the provision of a directly elected executive head.“Amendment of the constitution is not a matter of courage,” Oli said. “The government won’t dare to amend the constitutional provision that does not need revision, but where it is needed, the government will not hesitate to show the courage.”Likewise, Pashupati Shamsher Rana of Rastriya Prajantra Party also asked which of the articles of the constitution was the present coalition government of Nepali Congress and CPN-UML vying to amend.“There is no definite article that the present government is aiming to amend as of now,” Oli answered. “It would be determined during the amendment process and it will be done based on the discussion with the lawmakers.”Congress lawmaker Khadka had also put forth his queries related to constitution amendment.The coalition government led by Oli was formed after the seven-point agreement between Nepali Congress and CPN-UML on July 1.

The Congress held its 14th general convention in Kathmandu in December 2021. Almost two and a half years after the party's general convention, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, appointed the heads of 37 departments on August 5. Deuba also appointed 17 department heads last year. The party has yet to name 16 heads, including those of organisational, foreign affairs, and public relations departments. The Congress must hold its next general convention by the end of 2025, as per the party statute. However, it can be deferred by a few months citing special reasons. If the party is to hold its general convention on time, that should be done within over a year from now. But the party has also not appointed some office-bearers, let alone the departmental heads and its members, Congress leaders say.The treasurer remains to be appointed. The largest party in the House of Representatives has 70 departments. During last year's central committee meeting, the party increased its department count from 48 to 70. Though the party president appointed the various department heads, the leadership still needs to finalise the members of those departments. The party statute provides for each department to appoint 51 members. According to the party leader, the department head has the right to appoint ten members, whereas the party president appoints the rest, as per the statute. Govinda Pokharel, the head of the Economic Policy and Planning department, says the upcoming central committee meeting will appoint members of various departments. The party's prorogued central committee meeting will resume on Friday. The party central committee meeting commenced on August 7. After the five-day meeting, it was postponed for ten days, arguing that the party leaders needed to give time in Parliament and the parliamentary committee.“The party department could have shown the result by now had it been formed in time,” Pokharel told the Post. “But, if we look at the history of Congress, no president in the recent past has formalised the party department in time. Deuba is no exception.”Before Deuba, Sushil Koirala and Girija Prasad Koirala were the party presidents, and Pokharel added that both leaders failed to make the party department vibrant during their time.Arjun Narasingha KC, who has worked in various positions in the party, effectively under Girija Prasad's Koirala, partially agrees with Pokharel. “Forming the party department and making them vibrant was not a problem during Girija Prasad Koiral’s tenure. However, during Sushil Koirala and Deuba’s tenures, it became a major problem,” KC told the Post.“Forming the party department should not have been a problem for the president, but why are they hesitant? I just can’t say,” KC said.The party's statute mentions that the party president is responsible for appointing the department head and its members. However, the party leaders say that when other leaders, especially a senior one, show interest, the appointment gets delayed. “Various party departments are the organisational tools for the leaders to exercise power within the party,” Pokharel added. “If the leaders can install their favourite as the department head, it can amplify their strength within the party. Many of the party's senior leaders are interested in selecting the department heads and their members.”Last year, during the party's central committee meeting, which increased the number of departments, General Secretary Gagan Thapa had formalised a calendar of party activities. It mentioned appointing the department heads within two months. However, the party failed to follow the calendar passed by the central committee meeting. Thapa’s proposal was a good initiative but it failed in implementation, KC told the Post. As time passed, Deuba appointed some department heads. But can the departments formed late work effectively? For Pokharel, it depends on the leadership of the department. “But, chances to perform well will be slim.” “The lack of discipline in Congress, as seen lately, and the weakness in building party organisation are some of the reasons for not having effective party departments,” Pokharel argued. “Had our departments been functional, our local leaders and cadres would have known the party's thought process through various departmental programmes.” He adds that the party needs working departments.But political analyst Geja Sharma Wagle has a different take. Congress follows the traditional system of party operation. As long as the party is run in a traditional way, Wagle says, whether it forms the departments or not won’t matter.“The only way to make the Congress functional is to change its system,” Wagle told the Post. “The Congress should have a directly elected party president, in a departure from the traditional system, to make the party functional.” ","summary":"The Nepali Congress statute says that six months after the party's general convention, it should elect the heads of various party departments along with its members.

In the same deal, the two largest parties also agreed to take turns to head the government and amend the constitution, purportedly to ensure political stability, among other things. “The national consensus government will prioritise reviewing the strengths, weaknesses, and complications observed in implementing the constitution and will focus on amending the constitution and enacting related laws to ensure political stability,” Prime Minister Oli stated in Parliament on July 21, during his floor test. Some parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives, have raised serious concerns about the intentions behind the proposed amendments, accusing the big parties of attempting to revoke some progressive features of the statute. Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted from the position of prime minister on July 12 after the two largest parties joined hands to form a government. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, the fourth largest in the lower house, has also questioned the motives behind the Congress-UML deal. The JSP-Nepal, however, is comparatively more open to the idea of revising the constitution. The party has demanded that its certain concerns must be addressed should there be any amendments to the statute. The party has called for the formation of a constitutional review commission comprised of experts to propose amendments. The party’s central committee meeting held from August 11 to 14 decided to support amendments based on the recommendations of an elite commission. The party has also demanded amending the constitution to place local units under the provincial government. Likewise, it has demanded a directly elected executive head, a fully proportional election system, a federal justice system with proportional and inclusive representation, and self-governance based on national and ethnic identity. Yadav, who led a different political party, had submitted these proposals in the Constituent Assembly while drafting the statute as well.“The names of provinces should reflect their identities,” mentions the decision of the party’s central committee meeting.Many of JSP-Nepal’s demands related to amendments echo Yadav’s previous positions. Although the party had compromised on its demands during the constitution-making process for consensus, it is now advocating for a directly elected executive head, among other things. “Most of our current demands are the same ones that we had registered during the constitution-drafting process,” Prakash Adhikari, a party leader and a federal lawmaker from the party, told the Post. “If the two major parties address our demands, we are open to revising the constitution.”But Chandrakishore, a political analyst from Madhesh, finds the JSP-Nepal’s demands as irrelevant. Except for the directly elected executive head, the issues the party now has raised are old ones, he told the Post.“The party’s latest demands are the issues of the Madhesh Movement, but Yadav then chose to align with the ruling parties and betrayed the movement,” Chandrakishore told the Post. “Now he is again raising the same old issues in an attempt to placate the Madheshi people.” “If JSP-Nepal wants to truly engage with the people, it needs a leadership overhaul. Repeating past demands won’t work.” Despite lending support to Prime Minister Oli during the trust vote, the party was not accommodated in the Cabinet, while its splinter faction, the Janata Samajbadi Party holds a key portfolio in the Oli government. After Ashok Rai, then federal chair of the party, along with six lawmakers, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party, the JSP-Nepal’s strength in the House has diminished markedly.The party concluded its general convention in June unanimously electing Yadav as party chair. Even after over two months of the convention, the party is still to elect its office bearers, though it has formed a central executive council. A party’s central committee meeting last week demanded that the parliamentary and provincial constituencies be redrawn based on the latest census. Likewise, the party has also called for proportional representation in the National Assembly. Similarly, the party also vows to dissolve District Coordination Committees, arguing they are redundant under the federal structure.  "},{"hash":"ccf616b9210a2be7bc1b6d589d8dfc2b0ee1571e81485259abb165da17bb5c84","title":"maoists-thought-their-internal-rift-was-plugged-not-quite-so","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/08/18/maoists-thought-their-internal-rift-was-plugged-not-quite-so","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb-1723942524.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1723939200000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"Barely a month after exiting from the government, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third-largest party in the House of Representatives, has faced a power struggle between party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma.The conflict between a wartime Maoist commander Sharma and his “supreme leader” Dahal, which had been simmering for quite a while, surfaced at the party’s standing committee meeting that concluded on Thursday.Sharma not only spoke against Dahal but also presented a written document to the standing committee. At the meeting, Sharma asked Dahal to step down as party chairman. Dahal has led the party uninterruptedly for over three-and-a-half decades.At the end of the standing committee meeting, leaders had said that the differences between Dahal and Sharma were resolved. But that conclusion seems premature. The two were busy accusing and criticising each other at a public function in Kathmandu. Dahal had to pacify Sharma on Saturday as he complained of not being trusted by Dahal and other Maoist leaders. “When I was assigned to build an alliance with the CPN-UML, I worked for the same but was tagged as KP Oli’s man,” Sharma said at the function. Later, the Maoist Centre decided to ally with the Nepali Congress, and he worked for the same as directed by Dahal, Sharma claimed. “But I was dubbed Sher Bahadur Deuba’s man. When will I be called the Maoist party’s man? When will you call me Prachanda’s man?” said Sharma, pointing to Dahal, who was sitting at the same podium as the chief guest.Taken aback, Dahal seemed to be consoling Sharma saying that comrade Prabhakar [Sharma] would never split the party, contrary to some media reports.Dahal rubbished reports that Sharma was trying to split the party as baseless and that the days-long standing committee meeting had dispelled all rumours.The Maoist party chief and former prime minister, however, admitted that there were still some confusions and that the meeting had decided to look into the matter and make things clear and resolve them with joint effort.Soon after the party was out of the government, it called the meetings of the standing committee and the secretariat and discussed the Maoist CEntre's future course, including unity with other fringe parties, strengthening the Socialist Front, and building the party’s organisation.“There were some matters of serious suspicion and some still exist. And the meeting has decided to study and find how such a situation of suspicion emerged,” Dahal said. The Maoist leader promised to study the issue jointly with Sharma and, if needed, the party may form a probe committee.“We have reached an understanding to properly address the remaining concerns as well,” Dahal added.Sharma is not alone in demanding that Dahal handover the party’s reins.Even Maoist Centre senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha has asked Dahal to quit the leadership position. A large number of Maoist leaders at the central as well as lower committees want to see an overhaul of the party, said a central member.“If we fail to transform the party, there will be no hope for us besides surrendering to other parties in the 2027 elections,” the leader said.Another central committee member however doesn’t trust Dahal to build the party organisation. “Dahal would rather forge unity with other left parties and, if possible, explore options to contest the upcoming elections jointly with CPN-UML, the country’s largest communist party,” said the central member.The leader said he was unsure if the ruling UML would turn down Dahal’s proposal to join hands once again. According to him, Dahal’s strategy is to bring together left-leaning parties and put pressure on the UML, which leads the government with the backing of the Nepali Congress, to make an electoral alliance with the Maoists. The leader argues that the UML is preparing itself internally to contest the elections on its own, without allying with anyone.“This is the beginning of an infighting in the Maoist Centre because we abandoned the agenda of strengthening the federal, republican and secular Nepal,” said Ram Karki, secretary of the Maoist Centre. “This tussle is unlikely to stop anytime soon.”Because the conflict emerged under Dahal’s ‘schooling’, Karki claimed.He recalled that Mohan Baidya, who supported Dahal’s school of thought, engaged in a similar tussle before leaving the party. That conflict did not subside but intensified, leading Baidya to finally split the party, Karki observed.Later, Baburam Bhattarai, who also emerged allegedly from Dahal’s schooling, led a similar revolt, Karki recalled. “He also deserted the party. This time, too, the tussle has surfaced among those schooled under Dahal, so no one knows the outcome,” said Karki.For decades, Sharma remained a close confidant of Dahal. But he grew up to be a dissident after Dahal refused to appoint him the general secretary last year. Another deputy general secretary, Barsha Man Pun, was also an aspirant for the post of general secretary.Sharma and Pun are taken as Dahal’s lieutenants, right from the launch of the Maoist insurgency in 1996. Sidelining both during the 2022 party general convention, Dahal picked Dev Gurung, who had little influence in the party.Karki described the Congress-UML alliance’s move to oust the Maoist Centre from the government as a good opportunity to strengthen the Maoist party.“If the Nepali Congress and the UML hadn’t ejected our party from the government, we would have been finished by the time of next elections,” said Karki. “As we have been removed from power three years ahead of the election, there is some room for transformation.”Senior party leaders have given Dahal two options: transform himself and the party or vacate the chair that he has been occupying for over 35 years.Another central committee member said that if the conflict was an internal matter and the fight genuine, the party would emerge unscathed. “Otherwise, if external factors are working within the party, then the party will face a serious crisis,” said the leader.However, some Maoist leaders are confident that the party will not face a grave crisis. “Janardan ji questioned the party leadership. Isn’t that a good practice in the party?” said Yubaraj Chaulagain, a central committee member. “However, Chairman Dahal is addressing them.”Chaulagain said that the party leadership would collect reports from the party’s provincial committees and sister organisations and take the right decision based on them. “There’s the proposal for the party’s transformation. It will be discussed. We will gather more feedback and ideas from the lower committees, and follow them,” said Chaulagain. “Gradually, we will address the issues raised by Janardan ji.” ","summary":"Barely a month after exiting from the government, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third-largest party in the House of Representatives, has faced a power struggle between party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma.The conflict between a wartime Maoist commander Sharma and his “supreme leader” Dahal, which had been simmering for quite a while, surfaced at the party’s standing committee meeting that concluded on Thursday.Sharma not only spoke against Dahal but also presented a written document to the standing committee.

This time, too, the tussle has surfaced among those schooled under Dahal, so no one knows the outcome,” said Karki.For decades, Sharma remained a close confidant of Dahal. But he grew up to be a dissident after Dahal refused to appoint him the general secretary last year. Another deputy general secretary, Barsha Man Pun, was also an aspirant for the post of general secretary.Sharma and Pun are taken as Dahal’s lieutenants, right from the launch of the Maoist insurgency in 1996. Sidelining both during the 2022 party general convention, Dahal picked Dev Gurung, who had little influence in the party.Karki described the Congress-UML alliance’s move to oust the Maoist Centre from the government as a good opportunity to strengthen the Maoist party.“If the Nepali Congress and the UML hadn’t ejected our party from the government, we would have been finished by the time of next elections,” said Karki. “As we have been removed from power three years ahead of the election, there is some room for transformation.”Senior party leaders have given Dahal two options: transform himself and the party or vacate the chair that he has been occupying for over 35 years.Another central committee member said that if the conflict was an internal matter and the fight genuine, the party would emerge unscathed. “Otherwise, if external factors are working within the party, then the party will face a serious crisis,” said the leader.However, some Maoist leaders are confident that the party will not face a grave crisis. “Janardan ji questioned the party leadership. Isn’t that a good practice in the party?” said Yubaraj Chaulagain, a central committee member. “However, Chairman Dahal is addressing them.”Chaulagain said that the party leadership would collect reports from the party’s provincial committees and sister organisations and take the right decision based on them. “There’s the proposal for the party’s transformation. It will be discussed. We will gather more feedback and ideas from the lower committees, and follow them,” said Chaulagain. “Gradually, we will address the issues raised by Janardan ji.” "},{"hash":"838329c05d49c976d72f06418bc3a645c7f2baaf58000f1d431be3ebfe1ee606","title":"dahal-faced-a-storm-at-maoist-party-meet-then-he-pacified-two-lieutenants-who-led-opposition","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/08/16/dahal-faced-a-storm-at-maoist-party-meet-then-he-pacified-two-lieutenants-who-led-opposition","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/Untitled8-1723773368.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1723766400000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has been leading the party for over three-and-a-half decades, has yet again pacified the leaders who want him to hand over the leadership.Janardan Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—deputy general secretaries of the Maoist party—had demanded that Dahal hand over the party leadership to a leader of their generation. The two leaders raised the issue during the standing committee meeting that commenced on August 9.Leaders concluded the meeting on Thursday as they decided to strengthen the Maoist party through internal dialogue between the leaders on their disagreements.Party secretary Ram Karki said that responding to the questions raised during the standing committee meeting on August 10, party chair Dahal vowed to address their issues.The party will resolve the theoretical as well as ideological differences among the party leaders through dialogue, Karki told the Post, quoting Dahal.On August 9, the first day of the meeting, the Maoist chair presented a verbal proposal on current political affairs, party building, and other pertinent issues.After Dahal’s presentation, some leaders raised questions about the party’s policies and leadership. Among them, Janardan Sharma, a deputy general secretary, submitted a written proposal on August 10, calling for a review of Dahal’s leadership and suggesting that the party chair be limited to a ceremonial role as patron.In his document, Sharma alleged, among other things, that the party leadership was trying to use state power against him.In the 14-page document submitted to the meeting, Sharma accused the party leadership of ‘spreading disinformation’ about him and the other deputy general secretary, Pun. He also accused the top leaders of even misusing state power against him.“The fake information about the party split, which was generated from Khumaltar [the private residence of Dahal], spread widely after reaching Baluwatar [the prime minister’s official residence where Dahal was staying until last month when the government changed],” Sharma questions the party leadership in his document. “There are questions: why did the leadership disseminate fake information?”However, Maoist Centre leaders said the issue has been settled, for now, after Dahal pledged to resolve it through intra-party discussions.Party chair Dahal, while speaking to the press briefly after the conclusion of the standing committee meeting on Thursday, said the reports and rumours about party split were baseless.“Rumours related to the party split led by comrade Prabhakar [Janardan Sharma] are baseless,” Dahal told journalists.The meeting also decided to hold consultative meetings at the provincial level, where the party's office bearers will also participate. After the meeting, the party will call for a full-fledged meeting of the central committee in mid-September (Ashoj first week).Another party secretary, Devendra Paudel, said the upcoming central committee meeting will call the party's special general convention, as decided during the eigth general convention held in 2022.But Lilamani Pokharel, a party secretary, says no decision was taken with regard to convening a special general convention as only the central committee has a mandate to call a special general convention, the supreme body of a party that can take final decisions on the party’s policies and leadership.“The party will go for a special general convention only if a central committee meeting decides to go for that,” Pokharel told the Post.After the party was out of the government in mid-July, calls for Dahal to relinquish the top position have grown. Haribol Gajurel, a close aide of Dahal and deputy general secretary, also raised the issue of leadership change during a meeting of party officials before the standing committee meeting and demanded a special congress to address the issues.Gajurel proposed that all office-bearers should resign and make a fresh start to rejuvenate the party. He even submitted his own resignation as a starting point. Following this, on the second day of the standing committee meeting held on August 10, Deputy General Secretary Sharma questioned the central leadership in his political paper.However, party spokesperson Agni Sapkota, who is close to Dahal, argued that the questions raised by Sharma were aimed at strengthening the party. “The issue I raised during the standing committee meeting was for the betterment of the party and to strengthen the leadership of Dahal,” Sapkota quoted Sharma as saying.“The party leadership has also taken the issue raised by the standing committee members, including deputy general secretary Gajurel, Sharma, and Barshaman Pun, on a positive note.”During Dahal's tenure as prime minister, Gajurel, his political adviser, had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the party's lack of adherence to procedures and methods. As questions arose about the central leadership of the Maoist Centre, which is focused on organisational development, Dahal found himself in a defensive position during the standing committee meeting. According to party insiders, it was after a long time that Dahal faced tremendous pressure during a standing committee meeting as both Sharma and Pun, who have strong command in the party organisation, stood together to demand Dahal’s exit from the party leadership. It was something unusual for Maoist leaders as the two leaders, who defended Dahal in the past, joined hands by closing their ranks to fiercely criticise the party chief. Sharma and Pun, both former finance ministers, are deemed the two most powerful leaders after Dahal.Both leaders claimed the position of general secretary at the party’s general convention in early 2022. Though they were willing to contest for the post, Dahal instead chose Dev Gurung as the general secretary. After the general convention, Sharma has been maintaining a distance from Dahal and he challenges the party chief on various occasions. Of late, Pun, too, has joined Sharma to challenge Dahal. At the standing committee meeting, Pun said there should be a debate on the party's chairperson's term limit. \"Instead of discussing whether the leader should step down now, we need to determine the chair’s term limit,\" he added. Leaders said Dahal faced a pressure of this scale in a party meeting probably for the first time in nearly a decade, since the exit of key leaders Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya. Bhattarai and Baidya lead their own parties now.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” ","summary":"The rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers.

The company makes Rs450 million in transactions annually and has a Rs1 billion worth of production capacity in case of high demand.Rijal opened his own company after having worked in a dalmoth factory.“My uncle Tej Kumar opened a dalmoth factory at Urlabari, in eastern Nepal, in 1980,” said Rijal. He worked there in 1982.To sell the dalmoth produced at his uncle’s factory, Rijal travelled to many places around the country. While visiting Chitwan for sales, he saw the possibility of producing and selling dalmoth independently. In 1987, Rijal started the groundwork.In December 1987, he started production at his son-in-law’s house by frying it in a pan.Initially, the son-in-law helped Rijal. After a year, his brothers, too, joined him.Rijal then started to expand the business. “I learned the craft from production to sales and keeping accounts while working with my uncle. I had built a good network in the market. The skills I learned gave me confidence to start my own production,” he said.He visited Chitwan to Butwal and Tanahun to Bimalnagar to sell dalmoth.“My brother saw the potential every time he came to Chitwan from the eastern region to sell dalmoth. The bridge on the Narayani river had just been constructed. Narayangadh-Muglin road was being operated. All this gave him the thought of expanding the business from here,” said Purushottam Rijal, Rajendra's brother.At that time, raw materials of dalmoth could be brought on credit while the finished product sold in cash.Initially, Rijal introduced his products under the brand name ‘Shantkamal’. After six years, in 1993, he registered his firm as ‘Rijal Foods’ and started production. To give the firm a corporate structure, he renamed the company Rijal Food and Beverage Private Limited in 2015. That year, he bought 22 kattha land at Belshi, Ratnanagar municipality.There is a production plant on ten katthas. The remaining land is being used for storage.The factory currently produces 25 types of snacks, including bhujiya, chips, and furandana. The company sells snacks in 10-gram packages to 800-gram packages.“Our products reached across the country. We have 190 dealers from Taplejung in the east to Darchula in the west,” said Purushottam, the managing director.He said that the company's popular products are dalmoth, bhujiya, and chips. Made with whole dry chillies, peanuts, pieces of ginger, and curry leaves on beaten rice, furandana from Rijal Foods is consumed mostly by field and office workers.Consumers are attracted to products by their quality and packaging. Considering this, the company has adopted advanced techniques of production and packaging, said Purushottam.Rapid urbanisation has made shopping malls and department stores ubiquitous. Indian dalmoth and bhujiya brands are highly visible in these shopping centres.Nepali dalmoth used to be produced in a small area. The packaging was poor, and the marketing was not aggressive.“We were enrolled in the VAT system in 1997. This benefited us in getting support from a project in Denmark to produce unadulterated and qualitative products. For three months, they guided us,” Purushottam said.“The project helped us learn efficient fuel-saving methods, which helped increase productivity, packaging and marketing.”Rijal brothers often visited Rajasthan, India, mainly to observe various dalmoth and bhujiya factories. They even attended dalmoth and bhujiya-related fairs in India.This helped the Rijals learn about the equipment and technology used in similar factories.In 2011, Purushottam started using new technology for dalmoth production. Purushottam said that snacks like dalmoth, bhujiya, and Rijal chips have a 22 percent share of the Nepali market. Rijal's snack products have reached countries such as Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Malta, Germany, France, Australia and Japan, among others.Rajendra’s sons Swarup and Saurabh also produce pickles, ketchup, and sauce under the Rijal brand.

The festive season in Nepal is a perfect mixture of cultural celebration and economic activity.The economic slowdown had dampened the festival season last year, but traders say they are optimistic this year.While there is no official data on festival spending, economic activity in Nepal peaks during September-November. Some economists estimate that 40 to 70 percent of market activities occur around these three key festivals.It is estimated that many people save throughout the year to spend during these festivals.Business houses, banks, and government officials receive bonuses for the festivals, and suppliers are keen to capitalise on the anticipated increase in demand.Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to cut back on purchases. But this year, banks have sufficient liquidity, and traders are optimistic about sales growth.Ramu Paudel, spokesperson at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, said that the trend of opening letters of credit (LC) to import goods ahead of the festive season has been promising.“Based on this trend, we also expect a rise in international trade this year.” Nepal's imports declined for two consecutive fiscal years, reversing several years of surging imports.According to the central bank, merchandise imports decreased 1.2 percent to Rs1.59 trillion in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July, against a decrease of 16.1 percent a year ago. Earlier, Nepal's imports declined by 7.2 percent in the fiscal year 2001-02.The Post talked to a few traders about the demand outlook.Automobile dealers are particularly optimistic and excited about this year’s festive sales.“The automobile business slowed down after the pandemic. However, the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has made us hopeful this year,” said Puskar Ojha, vice president of Nepal Automobile Dealers’ Association.“The banks have enough liquidity and are ready to lend, especially for EVs. We hope EV sales will rise by 25 percent this festive season,” he said. EV sales cover 50-60 percent of the overall automobile market share. The association is organising the NADA Auto Show 2024 from August 27 to September 1. The show is expected to draw 75,000 visitors.“The new government has brought hope, and the market is also turning positive, so the overall sales of automobiles are expected to rise this festive season,” said Ojha.Automobile traders said that new models and variants of two-wheelers and four-wheelers have started arriving in the market, targeting the auto show. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high fueled by remittance inflows of Rs1.44 trillion, the highest amount on record.The distributors of consumer electronic goods are also optimistic and excited about extravagant festive sales.Alok Gupta, general manager of Samsung Consumer Electronic Goods, said, “There is optimism in the market.” “Observing the greening of the share market has given most businesses, including us, a sense of hope.”He said they anticipated a 25 percent growth in consumer home appliance sales this festive season.“There is a slowdown in market activities, but since banks have sufficient liquidity, it provides hope for all,” Gupta said. According to Him Electronics, the authorised distributor of Samsung electronics goods in Nepal, the company is launching new TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines just in time for the Dashain. The new offers are expected to be introduced at the beginning of September.“As we target 25 percent growth in sales, we plan for a good price offer to boost the sales. So, consumer electronic goods will not be expensive this festive season.” Bharat Karki, vice president of Nepal Trans Himalaya Border Commerce Association, said that imports of readymade garments, raw materials for apparel and shoes, as well as mobile phones and accessories have risen by 40 percent this year, mainly targeted for the festival season.“We have seen a rise in the number of distributors coming to Kathmandu and placing orders this year.”“The demand may not reach the pre-Covid levels, but it’s improving.” He said 40 cargo containers enter Nepal daily from the northern border points, loaded with festive goods.However, there are complaints from traders in New Road, once a major shopping hub.Kumar Karki, president of the Federation of National Traders Nepal, said that businesses in New Road may face repercussions since the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has not allowed roadside parking.“Shopper footfall has already dropped. Due to the parking restriction, we are not very optimistic about the upcoming festive sales.”According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's readymade garment imports increased 35.9 percent to Rs33.26 billion in the last fiscal year.

The KP Sharma Oli administration now wants to allow TikTok to operate with a slew of regulatory changes. Despite the public holiday, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology held an hour-long meeting on Tuesday to decide the fate of TikTok in Nepal. Observers say the TikTok issue is global and at the centre of a geopolitical contest between the US and China. TikTok's South Asia division emailed the Minister for Communication and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, ten days ago, requesting that the ban be lifted as it would follow the country's all rules and regulations. Gurung, however, declined to comment.The government restricted TikTok after introducing the ‘Directives on the Operation of Social Networking 2023’ in November last year.The directives made it mandatory for social media sites such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube, among others, to open liaison offices in Nepal.The government said the measure was introduced because an increasing number of people were complaining that the absence of the companies’ representatives in Nepal made it difficult for the authorities to address their users’ concerns and even remove objectionable content from the platforms.The directives include a 19-point not-to-do list for users on platforms like Facebook, X, TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.The directives say no one should create fake IDs on social media or share or make comments through such IDs. Likewise, people should not post any text, audio, video or picture that spreads hatred against any gender, community, caste, religion, profession, or people from any particular group.The new rule also bars any post promoting wrong activities such as child labour, human trafficking, child marriage or polygamy.“Now, the letter emailed by the Policy Committee Division of South Asia office of TikTok has said it is committed to follow all the rules and regulations,” said a top official at the ministry, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.“The government is positive.”The ministry is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss the issue further.“The agenda regarding lifting the ban will then go to the Cabinet seeking its approval in principle,” the official added.He said the exact date to lift the ban is unknown, but the upcoming Cabinet will decide on it.TikTok has written seven letters to the Nepal government requesting to lift the ban before.In the letter, TikTok says that the ban is causing financial losses to the country and the company. Another official at the ministry, requesting anonymity, told the Post that the government has been responding to TikTok, saying that the loss is one part, but rules and regulations are important.After the ban, people started using TikTok by installing a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass local censorship. But gradually, most of them have switched to Facebook and Instagram reels, which allow users to film or upload video clips. Sudhir Parajuli, president of the Internet Service Providers’ Association of Nepal, said that people downloaded VPNs immediately after the TikTok ban, which increased international bandwidth consumption by 20 percent. “As most users access TikTok via VPN, it didn’t impact the business much.”VPN establishes a digital connection between a computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts the user’s personal data, masks the internet protocol address and sidesteps website blocks and firewalls on the internet.Internet service providers said that TikTok accounts for nearly 40 percent of internet bandwidth consumption in Nepal. When it is banned, internet consumption does not decline due to the use of VPN. Before the ban, the association said there were around 2.2 million TikTok users in Nepal.Following the government decision, two telecommunications service providers—Nepal Telecom and Ncell—and more than 30 internet service providers blocked TikTok.The former government's decision to ban TikTok was widely criticised by experts and the public, who cited it as an attack on freedom of expression and speech.Internet experts said that it is difficult to ban technology.

Nepal now exports almost equal to what the country used to generate five years ago. Observers see the development as a sign of strengthened ties between the neighbouring countries. Last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July, Nepal became a net exporter of electricity. That means Nepal is selling more electricity than it buys. The country’s power utility, Nepal Electricity Authority, said it exported 1.94 billion units of electricity, or more than 700 MW, worth Rs17.07 billion in the last fiscal year. During the dry season, Nepal imported 1.91 billion units of electricity worth Rs16.93 billion. “We have estimated that the export revenue would increase to Rs27 billion in the current fiscal year if we succeeded in exporting the additional power or up to 1,000 MW,” said Chandan Kumar Ghosh, the authority spokesperson. “Our preference, however, is domestic consumption. We will export the surplus,” he said. “After we receive a no-objection letter from India, the export will begin or be formalised.”Currently, Nepal is exporting 620 MW of energy from the 400 kV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line, and 70 MW is being exported via the 132 kV Mahendranagar-Tanakpur transmission line. Nepal Electricity Authority has also entered medium-term power sales agreements with state electricity boards (power distribution companies known in short as discoms) in Haryana and Bihar. And for the first time, Nepal is exporting power to Bihar through a medium-term power sales agreement.“We are happy that Nepal exports about 1,000 MW of electricity to India. This is a new milestone.Our neighbourhood first policy and specific people-to-people and cultural ties have advanced our relationship,” the Indian Embassy in Nepal wrote on X.This is the first year of a long-term energy deal in which India has signed an agreement to buy 10,000 MW of electricity from Nepal in the next ten years.According to a statement by the Indian embassy in Nepal, the Designated Authority of India has approved importing additional energy from 12 hydropower projects in Nepal. This takes the total allowed quantum from 690 MW from 16 projects to 941 MW from 28 projects.In October 2021, India approved 39 MW of power imports from Nepal for the first time. This figure has grown more than 24-fold in less than three years.Nepal first began exporting power by selling in the day-ahead market of the Indian Energy Exchange. Since then, Nepal has also been granted access to the real-time market. Nepal has been selling 44 MW in the real-time market since the southern neighbour opened the door to competition in July last year.India has also opened the provision of counting hydropower imports from Nepal as a part of the Hydropower Purchase Obligation for buyers in India, which further incentivizes buyers to purchase power from Nepal.“With these developments, Nepal is on track to become the leading hydropower exporter in the South Asia region,” reads the statement. “An agreement to sell 40 MW power to Bangladesh has also been finalised. It was planned to be signed on July 28, 2024, but was postponed due to recent political developments in Bangladesh.”Despite political instability, Nepal is slowly but steadily moving towards realising its hydropower potential. Between 2007 and 2017, the country experienced a massive electricity supply shortage that caused up to 18 hours of daily load-shedding. That caused a severe dent in Nepal’s economy, stalling the growth of manufacturing, which ultimately forced thousands of youths to try their luck abroad due to the lack of job opportunities at home. Installed power generation capacity crawled from 706 MW in 2011 to 856 MW in 2016.Nepal signed the India-Nepal Power Trade Agreement in 2014 during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit, even though it was reeling from an acute power shortage.Nepal became a power surplus country during the wet season after the 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project came into operation in July 2021.According to the power utility, the installed electricity capacity has now increased to 3,156.96 MW, consisting of 2,990.6 MW of hydroelectric power, 106.9 MW of solar power, 6 MW of cogeneration, and 53.4 MW of thermal electricity.“We have estimated to add more than 1,000 MW of electricity this fiscal year to take the energy quantum to 4,500 MW,” said Ghosh, the spokesperson.Various reports show that electricity trade could significantly narrow Nepal’s trade deficit if there is a political will to attract foreign direct investment in the hydro sector. According to a report, Nepal can earn up to Rs310 billion annually in 2030 and as high as Rs1,069 billion annually in 2045 if it sells electricity to India by harnessing its hydropower potential.Nepal stands to generate these earnings provided it starts exporting 13 gigawatts of electricity to India by 2030 and doubles this capacity by 2045, according to a 2017 USAID report titled ‘Economic Benefits from Nepal-India Electricity Trade’.According to the report produced by Integrated Research and Action for Development, Nepal needs to invest up to Rs2,596 billion by 2030 and another Rs2,216 billion between 2031 and 2045 to harness the electricity of this quantum.In a statement issued recently by Kul Man Ghising, the managing director of Nepal Electricity Authority, Nepal plans to generate 28,000 MW of electricity by 2035. It said that in the next five years, or by 2028-29, Nepal's installed capacity would reach 10,000 MW. Projects totalling nearly 7,000 MW are currently in various stages of construction.”The electricity authority said it is also ready to sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) with solar projects up to 800MW.  ","summary":"India approved a plan to import an additional 251 MW of electricity from Nepal on Monday, bringing the total imports to nearly 1,000 MW. Nepal now exports almost equal to what the country used to generate five years ago. Observers see the development as a sign of strengthened ties between the neighbouring countries. Last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July, Nepal became a net exporter of electricity. That means Nepal is selling more electricity than it buys. The country’s power utility, Nepal Electricity Authority, said it exported 1.94 billion units of electricity, or more than 700 MW, worth Rs17.07 billion in the last fiscal year. During the dry season, Nepal imported 1.91 billion units of electricity worth Rs16.93 billion. “We have estimated that the export revenue would increase to Rs27 billion in the current fiscal year if we succeeded in exporting the additional power or up to 1,000 MW,” said Chandan Kumar Ghosh, the authority spokesperson. “Our preference, however, is domestic consumption. We will export the surplus,” he said. “After we receive a no-objection letter from India, the export will begin or be formalised.”Currently, Nepal is exporting 620 MW of energy from the 400 kV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line, and 70 MW is being exported via the 132 kV Mahendranagar-Tanakpur transmission line.

According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static. According to economists, everything from wages to business growth and social security to other state benefits will remain static, which will encourage youth to try their luck abroad.

Health workers at the local unit said that they expect federal agencies to monitor health facilities overwhelmed with infected patients and ensure that preventive measures have been properly enforced.“More than the directives, we need test kits, essential medicines and health workers to care for the patients in our hospitals,” Agam Raj Upadhyaya, health coordinator of the rural municipality, told the Post over the phone from Anbukhaireni. “Neither the Ministry of Health and Population of the federal government nor the agencies under the provincial government have taken the issue seriously, even after a massive dengue outbreak hit the entire local unit.”Health workers in the virus-hit local unit said that over 50 people test positive for the dengue virus daily in Aanbukhaireni Rural Municipality alone. Local health facilities are struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of seriously ailing people. Patients are being treated on benches and even on the floors of health facilities, according to health officials working at the municipality. Some patients go to Chitwan, Pokhara, and even Kathmandu for treatment.“Due to a human resource crunch, we have pulled health workers from peripheral health posts to help in hospitals overwhelmed with dengue patients,” said Upadhyaya. “Over 45 patients are being treated in a 15-bed hospital. We expect help from provincial and federal government agencies to care for seriously ailing patients.”Health workers said they are doing their best to contain the spread of the deadly disease, but their measures, including the search-and-destroy drive, have become ineffective. Officials concede that the drive was launched only after the massive outbreak of the virus, and the ongoing rainfall has been hindering the measures taken to destroy the breeding grounds of mosquitoes.”Officials admit that the actual number of dengue cases could be higher as people with mild symptoms are not getting tested and are resting at home.What worries health workers the most is that with the spike in positive cases, they also see an increase in seriously ill patients.Officials admit that the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Public health experts say that the ongoing spread of dengue infection could have been prevented had the authorities concerned taken the problems seriously and launched the search-and-destroy drive.“How can we expect to prevent the spread of the virus by waiting to take measures until there is a massive outbreak of the disease?” asked Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “We have created only the agencies to give directions, not the ones to take action. Agencies under the federal government must help local units carry out surveillance, determine the serotype of the virus and provide care to patients.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far this year, two died, and 3,755 tested positive for the dengue virus that has spread in 74 districts across the country.Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days in other districts as well, as heavy rainfall continues across the country and post-monsoons season, which is considered the main dengue season, is yet to start.Experts say a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections and major outbreaks have been reported from many districts.

The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far this year, two died, and 3,755 tested positive for the dengue virus that has spread in 74 districts across the country.Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days in other districts as well, as heavy rainfall continues across the country and post-monsoons season, which is considered the main dengue season, is yet to start.Experts say a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections and major outbreaks have been reported from many districts.

Reducing one-third of premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention, treatment and promotion of mental health and well-being is among the UN-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets to which Nepal is committed.Experts say the suicide rate is an indicator of premature mortality within the SDGs, which are a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).“At the time when the government committed to SDGs in 2015, around 16 people took their own lives every 24 hours,” said Basudev Karki, a consultant psychiatrist. “Now the number has risen to 20. Our government had committed to reduce the suicide rate to 9.7 per 100,000 each year by 2022, but this number rose to 24, and last year it increased further to 25.”The government aims to reduce the suicide rate to 4.7 per 100,000 population by 2030 to meet the SDG targets, but as the deadline nears, more people are killing themselves every day. Mental health experts say people do not attempt suicide for any single reason, but rather due to a complex mix of factors including the rising cost of living and struggle to manage even their most basic needs such as food, housing, healthcare, and job security.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting not only the individual but also families, friends, colleagues, communities, and societies, according to themA study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council before the start of the pandemic shows that more than 10 percent of the adult population had mental issues in their lifetime and 4.3 percent were undergoing some sort of mental crisis.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, past suicide attempts, and a future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.“Even those individuals who appear healthy on the outside could also be struggling with serious mental health problems,” said Karki. “People generally do not like to talk about mental health issues due to the social stigma attached, and lack of awareness. To tackle the growing mental health problems, authorities concerned have to take multiple approaches.”Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing burden of mental health issues and the rising suicide rate and have been taking various measures to address the problems.“Along with providing free medications for mental health problems at state-run health facilities, we have been taking several other measures that include imparting mental health screening training for health workers,” said Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the division. “We have been working to declare two local units—Palungtar Municipality of Gorkha and Bagchaur Municipality of Salyan—as model municipalities for mental health.”According to officials, various mental health programmes will be rolled out in these local units, including screening for mental health problems and training for health workers, community workers, teachers, female community health volunteers, and others. Awareness campaigns will be launched, and health facilities will be strengthened to provide basic services for mental health problems.“This programme will be launched as a pilot and will be gradually expanded to other local units,” said Thapa. “The main aim of the programme is to encourage the local bodies to take responsibility for addressing the growing mental health issues. We will also launch an awareness drive to reduce the suicide rate, alcohol consumption, and substance use.”The World Health Organisation says one in four people in the world are affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the following helplines.Nepal Mental Hospital suicide hotline: 1166Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital suicide prenvention hotline: 9840021600:Patan Hospital crisis helpline for suicide prevention: 9813476123The Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation: 16600102005 ","summary":"Nepal witnessed an alarming rise in the suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year.“Around 20 people killed themselves on an average every 24-hour in the last fiscal year,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The number is the highest ever recorded in any fiscal year.”Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates.Police data show that 6,993 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2022-023, followed by 6,792 in the fiscal year 2021-022.As many as 7,117 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2020-021, during which the country witnessed the second and third wave of the coronavirus pandemic.

The UN agency defines an international public health emergency as an “extraordinary event” that poses a serious public health risk.“We have also asked concerned agencies and officials to step up surveillance measures and send people suspected to have contracted the virus to the National Public Health Laboratory for the test,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the division. “We also held a discussion with the representative of the UN health body in Nepal and other officials concerned about the potential risk of the mpox virus spreading.”Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. It is the second time since the UN health body declared mpox a global health emergency in two years, as the virus has spread alarmingly in the African continents and is at risk of entering other continents. The WHO said that 524 people died and more than 14,000 cases of infection have been reported this year alone in Africa, which exceeded last year’s figure.The mpox virus is transmitted through close contact such as sex, skin-to-skin contact, and the respiratory tract or mucous membranes.Doctors say animal-to-human transmission often occurs through bites, scratches or direct contact with infected animals’ blood, body fluids or wounds. The virus causes flu-like symptoms.Nepal had confirmed mpox infection in June last year after a 60-year-old foreigner tested positive for monkeypox infection.Public health experts say that every disease seen in any corner of the world is possible to come to Nepal due to the high mobility of its own people and foreign tourists. They say it is relatively easier for people from any part of the globe to come to Nepal and that it increases the risk of any disease seen in any part of the globe arriving in Nepal.“We cannot keep repeating the same mistake. When Covid spread in China, we thought that since we did not have a direct flight from disease-hit areas, the chance of the disease spreading to Nepal was low, but this proved to be wrong,” said Dr Shrawan Kumar Mishra, director at the provincial Public Health Laboratory of Madhesh Province. “Many people from our country travel to Africa, and our UN peacekeepers also serve there and return home. Anyone coming back from disease-hit countries must be kept in isolation for three weeks.”Experts say screening at the health desks of international airports and land crossings alone is not enough to prevent a possible outbreak of monkeypox in the country since symptoms usually appear between five and 21 days after infection. Moreover, not everyone will have visible symptoms on their skin or limbs. They say that asymptomatic persons can also transmit the virus.Symptoms of the mpox virus include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it. Doctors say that even though monkeypox infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the authorities concerned should not underestimate the risks.Globally, more than 87,000 cases and 112 deaths from monkeypox were reported in 2022, according to the WHOThe UN health body said it is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations and coordinating with partners through the interim Medical Countermeasures Network to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. ","summary":"I can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  "},{"hash":"a90b9db6c3c38cf48a1d63805bc18a62428b153ecbe76daccdb8010d4b8e3b5d","title":"this-summer-i-saw-the-everest-up-close","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2024/06/23/this-summer-i-saw-the-everest-up-close","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/main-1719107987.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719100800000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask.

Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it.

That is up from 2% in 2000 when the census first allowed people to select multiple races.America has long been a self-styled “melting pot” of people who trace their origins around the world, but in practice some states legally segregated citizens by race until the civil rights laws of the 1960s and laws prohibiting interracial marriage were not overturned until 1967.Social change since, though, has been rapid. Barack Obama was elected as the country’s first Black president in 2008, and Harris would be the first Black woman and South Asian if elected in November.“We’re living in a situation 50 years later where we could be looking at our second mixed-race president, and it’s beautiful,” said Svante Myrick, president of People for the American Way, an advocacy group, whose father was Black and his mother white.America’s future will look even more diverse. The vast majority of multiracial people are younger than 44 and a third are still children.The trend has been met by confusion, upset and worse from some of the US’s shrinking white majority. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump drew groans at a gathering of Black journalists last month when he falsely portrayed Harris as pivoting from Indian to Black.“I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black,” Trump said. “But you know what, I respect either one.”Harris has long identified with both her parents’ ancestry. In Trump’s remarks, some multiracial people saw echoes of their own experience of being asked to choose one or the other.Harris’ upbringing makes her a better leader for America, Democrats in Chicago said.“When you have individuals who carry multiple experiences in the same person, that's an asset,” said Representative Maxwell Frost, who is Lebanese, Puerto Rican and Haitian, speaking at a Politico event on the sidelines of the convention. “That enhances her ability to legislate and advocate\" on behalf of a broad range of Americans.The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment, nor did spokespeople for Trump.As the US becomes more diverse and multicultural, white nationalist groups continue to thrive online, pushing conspiracy theories such as the “The Great Replacement”, while some Republican lawmakers have focused on banning books and cancelling classes focused on racial history.Thousands of racial hate crimes are reported yearly, with 232 aimed at people of multiple races in 2022, the most recent year for which FBI data is available.“Unfortunately, we’re really into a period of backlash,” said Matthew Belmont, a Dartmouth College history professor who has studied the demographic trend, despite the 2020 election of Harris as vice president and her administration's elevation of racial justice priorities.Tara Betrayer, an Afro-Latina and white conservative co-founder of political action committee the Seneca Project, said she was once attracted to the Republican Party in part because of its emphasis on color-blind policies.“Do Democrats take it too far at times with racial identity politics? Well, yeah,” she said.Now an independent, Betrayer said some of the Republican Party’s recent rhetoric on issues including illegal migration carried undercurrents of racism. Republicans reject those criticisms, saying their focus on border controls are aimed at securing the country for all Americans.“This is really their last gasp at trying to stop the country from evolving, and I think they’re missing out on something that’s beautiful,” Betrayer said. ","summary":"As the US becomes increasingly multiracial, Kamala Harris's nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate reflects the nation's changing demographics, representing the country's fastest-growing racial category, despite ongoing racial tensions and resistance from some."},{"hash":"67ee757fa377d96174c94f60cfcbe303d35f89d9ed1dd2f7938f3ab65d697463","title":"Protests erupt in Indonesia as Parliament delays a change to the election law.","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/08/22/protests-across-indonesia-as-parliament-delays-change-to-election-law","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/PFTCB2M7ERJ4JI7JHXF5QVQPKU-1724310243.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1724284800000,"source":"kp","category":"world","content":"Indonesia's parliament delayed a vote on election law changes amid protests.

It involves strategically using diplomatic skills and practices to build and maintain relationships and collaborations, fostering partnerships among various stakeholders to achieve common goals in the education sector. Countries view educational opportunities for international students as a critical strategy for advancing their soft power agendas. However, Nepal has yet to realise its value, as the outcry of international students facing visa-related and other issues in Nepal has still not received sufficient attention among policymakers and educators.A nation's internationalisation policy in higher education is crucial in promoting economic growth and projecting goodwill toward other nations. For example, China has successfully utilised public diplomacy, culture and international education as soft power instruments. The country attracted 255,720 students in 2021 alone by presenting a peaceful and friendly image of its growing economy. China's success is partly attributed to its seven universities, which are ranked in the latest Times Higher Education’s global top 100 world rankings. In contrast, India's foreign student population, which was approximately 46,000 in 2021-22, remains much lower than that of leading countries like the United States (US), the United Kingdom and Australia, indicating that the government hasn’t fully capitalised on this diplomatic tool. However, India has made a notable progress, as there has been an increase of nearly 42 percent in foreign student enrollment over the past seven years. As part of its rebranding as a net aid provider, India has emphasised education diplomacy by reducing incoming aid, increasing foreign assistance and promoting internationalisation in higher education through initiatives like scholarships, the South Asia University proposal and global outreach expansion through institutions like Indira Gandhi National Open University.Cultural diversity is a vital aspect of education diplomacy. Many countries, like the US, China and India, engage in extensive cultural exchange programmes rather than just awarding degrees. The International Visitors Leadership Programme (IVLP), a premier professional exchange initiative of the US Department of State, is one of the oldest programmes. Every year, nearly 5,000 International Visitors participate in the IVLP. Through short-term visits to the US, current and emerging foreign leaders in various fields gain firsthand experience and build strong relationships with their American counterparts. Similarly, China fosters cultural exchanges through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), while India has institutions like the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) to promote cultural interactions.Education diplomacy is becoming a significant revenue source for governments. Attracting international students by signing a memorandum of understanding with various universities contributes to the universities' reach, reputation and revenue. When a nation positions itself as a higher education centre, its global influence increases. As more international students enrol in higher education institutions (HEIs), the institution's reputation will amplify, aiding in branding and internationalisation. The influx of foreign students also provides a substantial revenue stream for the host country. India is working to internationalise its education system by promoting students, faculties, programmes and campus mobility; all these initiatives support education diplomacy. For instance, an Indian student studying in Nepal will be exposed to the Nepali lifestyle and culture, fostering cultural understanding and bonding between the two countries. Attracting international students can also create a broad base of supporters.Status of Nepali universitiesNepali universities’ efforts in international relations and collaborations are far from encouraging. With the mass exodus of students abroad, the situation is bleak. There is no evaluation or national ranking system for Nepali HEIs, making it difficult to achieve even moderate rankings globally. The main issue with Nepali HEIs is employability rather than the quality of education. While universities are experiencing low enrollment, no concerted efforts have been made to compensate for this loss by attracting international students to Nepal. Additional challenges include low investment in research and innovation and a lack of competent faculty, leading to fewer university collaborations worldwide. Procedural challenges such as unclear visa policies and difficulties opening bank accounts and payments aggravate the situation. There is also ambiguity regarding the status of dependents or family members accompanying students while coming to Nepal.Despite the inherent challenges, Kathmandu University (KU) has taken steps to promote internationalisation. For example, foreign faculty members are offered a salary 1.5 times higher than local faculties, a modest effort to attract international talent. The Vice-Chancellor Scholarship Scheme has been introduced, providing scholarships to at least one foreign student in each school based on merit. Moreover, KU is running several programmes in collaboration with international HEIs, such as the M-Tech in Energy Systems (KU-Indian Institute Of Technology (IIT) Madras, India), Bachelor in Yogic Science and Well-being (KU-Sri Visweswara Yoga Research Institute, Tirupati, India), Bachelor of Information Technology (KU-Crown Institute of Higher Education, Australia) and a Joint PhD Program (KU-IIT Hyderabad), among others.Role of stakeholdersTo unleash Nepal’s education sector's potential, continuous support from a robust policy ecosystem, institutional strengthening, and increased investment are required. Although education diplomacy has been limited so far, Nepali diplomats must proactively find solutions. In other countries, presidents or heads of state often visit HEIs to assess the situation and initiate educational activities; however, such practices are uncommon among Nepali diplomats. The government should immediately work to ensure a smooth and hassle-free entry process for students wishing to study in Nepal. Necessary steps should be taken to make it easier for foreign students to pay tuition and other fees. The process for converting tourist or visit visas to student visas should be expedited. Universities should also provide insurance for foreign students, ensuring their sense of security in a new country. Moreover, universities should mobilise the Nepali diaspora and alums community to market local courses in niche areas, increasing global awareness and interest in Nepali Universities.

Following its adoption by the National Assembly and the approval of the President, the bill will be enacted as a third amendment.Addressing the lower house before passing the bill, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal expressed their shared views on the bill, claiming it was victim-centric, met international standards and complied with Supreme Court orders. However, except for rape cases and serious sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture, the bill doesn’t meet their claim. The primary concerns lie in categorising crimes, which remain unaddressed. While some groups have welcomed and supported the bill, mainstream victim groups, nevertheless, are advocating to make the process ‘victim-centric’ to attain tangible results. They have continuously pressed the lawmakers to improve the objectionable flaws and seize the opportunity that comes with the amendment. Serious flawsNot recognising “surviving enforced disappeared” people as victims is one of the flaws contradicting the international definition. Engaging child soldiers (verified by UNMIN) in war crimes committed by security forces or armed groups is confined to reparation in the bill. The classified non-pardonable serious human rights violations and pardonable human rights violations are severely problematic. The crimes that fall under serious human rights violations are kept in the ambit of human rights violations, which has caused a strong objection to not complying with the principles established in our so-called nationally driven process.Besides the grave human rights violations, according to the bill, any crimes committed against Nepal’s prevailing law, international human rights, or humanitarian laws are categorised as amnestiable. This means that crimes like torture, kidnapping, amputation and disability with serious torture, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, are subject to amnesty with the free consent of the victims. It also has a provision of a 75-percent reduction in sentencing, amounting to disguised amnesty, which contradicts the principle that criminal sanctions must be proportionate to the gravity of the crime and undermines the fundamental role and competency of the judiciary. Such provisions neither comply with international standards nor follow the Supreme Court orders. Widespread concernsThe bill has drawn international attention, with many diplomatic envoys and development partners taking to social media to comment and congratulate. On X, the UN Resident Coordinator Hanna Singer-Hamdy cautiously commented, “Engaging victims is imperative ... The UN stands ready to support inclusive TJ aligning with international human rights commitment and standards”. US Ambassador Dean R Thompson congratulated but also diplomatically stated, “A meaningful moment in Nepal’s journey to shaping its own peaceful, prosperous, resilient and democratic future”. EU and Swiss ambassadors called it a historic achievement and reiterated their full support for its implementation. These X posts from the development partners are perceived as goodwill gestures for completing the peace process without delay. However, they don’t ignore international obligations and criminal accountability under this pretext. The legitimacy of the whole process lies in adhering to transitional justice (TJ) principles, which are based on truth-seeking, justice, reparation and non-occurrence through institutional reforms. Nepal’s long-time commitments to international human rights and humanitarian laws come into the picture. Addressing the deeply rooted impunity and putting the country back on track with the rule of law towards a functioning and inclusive democracy and sustainable peace is essential. During UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ official visit to Nepal in October, TJ was recognised as a complex but vital way of securing lasting peace. Addressing Parliament, he said TJ needed to be inclusive and comprehensive and keep victims at heart for it to succeed. In a press meeting, he reiterated, “The United Nations stands ready to support your victim-centric process, and its implementation that meets international standards, and your own Supreme Court’s rulings.”Nepal is committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 and is a state party to various international human rights instruments, including the Geneva Convention, the Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and the Rights of the Child, and other international human rights laws. The authorities cannot ignore these international commitments. Moreover, it has also enacted the National Penal (Code) Act 2017, meeting international obligations enforcing criminal accountability. Embracing TJ’s core valuesEnsuring accountability for serious crimes should not be seen only as victims’ rights but as a legitimate concern for the post-conflict society. This determines the kind of future we are handing over to the next generation. It is time we raised the following questions: Are we building a just society with zero tolerance for impunity and strengthening the rule of law? Does this process that ensures non-repetition and durable peace fall under TJ’s core values? Will it break the culture of deep-rooted political violence? Finally, only seeking political consensus, as in the past, is not a viable solution to this process. The precondition of TJ’s success lies in earning the ‘trust’ of people, especially victims. However, the bill taken as the foundation of the process cannot do so, as the steps taken so far are designed to protect the perpetrators’ interests. In these circumstances, the victim leaders and the civil society involved in ending the process are reluctant to trust the ruling authorities, who have often failed to fulfil their promises.Three global rights organisations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists, issued a joint statement on Tuesday to ensure the integrity of the process and bring the law in compliance with Nepali and international legal standards. The bill indeed includes positive provisions, but serious accountability gaps must be addressed.

It is time we raised the following questions: Are we building a just society with zero tolerance for impunity and strengthening the rule of law? Does this process that ensures non-repetition and durable peace fall under TJ’s core values? Will it break the culture of deep-rooted political violence? Finally, only seeking political consensus, as in the past, is not a viable solution to this process. The precondition of TJ’s success lies in earning the ‘trust’ of people, especially victims. However, the bill taken as the foundation of the process cannot do so, as the steps taken so far are designed to protect the perpetrators’ interests. In these circumstances, the victim leaders and the civil society involved in ending the process are reluctant to trust the ruling authorities, who have often failed to fulfil their promises.Three global rights organisations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists, issued a joint statement on Tuesday to ensure the integrity of the process and bring the law in compliance with Nepali and international legal standards. The bill indeed includes positive provisions, but serious accountability gaps must be addressed.

Article 235 of the Constitution grants the federal parliament the authority to draft the necessary coordination law to maintain coordination among the federal units. In line with this directive, the “Federation, Province, and Local Level (Coordination and Interrelation) Act, 2020 (2077),” commonly known as the Intergovernmental Relations (IGR) Law, was enacted.The primary purpose of the IGR law is to strengthen the federal system by fostering coordination and cooperation in areas such as law and policy formulation. As Nepal transitioned from a centralised system to a federal structure, laws were critical to facilitate this transition and address people’s aspirations following the new constitution. To bridge this gap and ensure that the newly established three tiers of government function in accordance with the spirit of the constitution, the federal government introduced the IGR law. The law has become one of the most widely discussed pieces of legislation.However, Nepal embraced federalism without fully developing the necessary infrastructure and groundwork for its effective implementation. This decision has led to ongoing challenges, as political parties and their leaders have differing interpretations of federalism from the outset. These differences became apparent soon after the first government was elected in 2017, accompanying the federalism. Despite the constitutional provisions agreed upon by all political parties, implementation has been walking at a snail’s pace, with some provisions still unfulfilled.This has raised concerns, particularly as provincial governments have been demanding their rights from the federal government. Local governments, which had already established their bases and were revived nearly after two decades of dormancy with extensive rights, are now neglected.IGR lawThe implementation of the IGR law has begun, with major provisions gradually coming into effect. However, the process has been hindered by a centralised mindset, sluggish bureaucracy and political meddling.While all federal units have widely accepted the IGR law, the primary concern lies in its effective implementation and the devolution of power. The law’s main objective is to facilitate the implementation of constitutional provisions related to power sharing among the three tiers of government. A detailed analysis reveals that many of the law’s key provisions have only been partially implemented, highlighting the urgent need for a robust mechanism to ensure that all structures envisioned by the law are fully functional.Leaders holding executive positions at the federal level have been reluctant to devolve exclusive powers to the sub-federal levels. This reluctance, driven by a desire to retain power at the federal level, has significantly impeded the proper implementation of constitutional provisions and laws intended to strengthen inter-governmental relations. Additionally, the stakeholders’ lack of ownership has further obstructed the process. For the proper application of the law, all stakeholders must clearly understand its importance.Government officials have often failed to grasp the spirit of the explanatory notes, which outline the principles of coordination, cooperation and co-existence that underpin the IGR. Despite having the necessary legal framework, state organs have not ensured its proper execution. However, the provinces and local levels have shown resilience, refusing to relent, which is a positive aspect.Slow implementationSeveral factors have contributed to the slow implementation of the IGR law. Unstable governments have delayed meetings of Sectoral Thematic Committees, the National Coordination Council (NCC) and the Provincial Coordination Council (PCC), affecting their ability to resolve issues. Frequent changes in government have also disrupted the settings of IGR mechanisms. Additionally, the study of the law has been delayed due to a lack of resources, with employees in the law ministry often juggling dual responsibilities that hinder their work.Local governments are often unaware of many IGR law provisions and lack the resources, technical manpower and skills to implement them fully. The use of non-declarative phrases and sentences, such as “matters to be considered” or “if found necessary,” has weakened the law’s effectiveness.One striking example of such a lack of coordination is the delay of the Kathmandu-Terai fast-track project. It highlights the significant lack of coordination between the three government tiers despite the existence of the IGR law.Addressing coordination issuesA permanent structure at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) is needed to function as the secretariat of the National Coordination Council. This structure should have a strong presence of representatives from sub-federal levels. Currently, the Provincial Coordination Section of the OPMCM handles issues related to the provinces, while the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration manages local-level issues. A single mechanism should be developed to address issues concerning both federal units.Similarly, a mechanism for coordination and consultation at provincial and local levels should be established. Section 4 of the IGR law does not specify which federal body will coordinate with provinces and local levels while formulating laws and policies on exclusive and concurrent power matters. A coordination and consultation mechanism should be developed at the federal level, as the legislature has the sole authority to make laws, and the government prepares the first draft of bills.The Intergovernmental Fiscal Council was established under the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act of 2017 to resolve fiscal issues between federal units. Since the council is more inclusive, functional and effective, the representation model used in the Sectoral Thematic Committees should be similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Council law. Having at least one local representative from each province could help raise and resolve their issues.The Provincial Coordination Council should be made more inclusive, with increased representation from local levels. This would ensure that the new mechanism represents all local levels. Compared to the initial one, the existing provision is regressive. A series of information-sharing programmes should also be conducted among federal units to educate them on the IGR law and federalism. The Federalism Implementation Special Committee of the National Assembly has urged the government to launch a broad awareness campaign from the grassroots to the federal level. Targeted training and orientation sessions at all local levels are essential to inform stakeholders about the law’s provisions and implications.Other things include resource management, skilled human resources and logistics management. These would prove beneficial in addressing the coordination issues in our federal structure.

This decision had “terrorised people”, as they feared they would be deprived of social security services, and many registered in haste.But the government last month decided to overturn the directive with equal haste. Now, the Nepalis are left confused: To obtain it or not to obtain it? Seemingly disbelieving the government's changing position on the use of the NID, over half a million people opted for it between mid-June to mid-July. Yet, there is little information about whether the government has worked out the behind-the-scenes procedures for its proper utility. Despite the NID’s design to combine important identity cards and documents including driving licenses, academic documents, voting cards, insurance details, and ATM card numbers in a single chip, implementing agencies still lack the infrastructure for such an endeavour. This technological hurdle adds to the already challenging task of fully executing the NID card campaign six years after the government started distributing it. Moreover, the hubbub surrounding the NID’s “revolutionary” function has proven to be dubious—it is either of no use or is imposed arbitrarily on the people. This is a prime example of how our authorities care not to think about its citizens' comfort or welfare when they come up with new policies or schemes. The authorities' main argument for implementing the NID is that it will be a one-stop solution for surveilling and controlling criminal activities like financial fraud by removing duplication.

However, the government is yet to fully assure citizens about data privacy; what is working in the government’s favour is that many lack digital literacy enough to know about their privacy rights. Moreover, the government has not clearly explained how it plans to segregate information access by multiple agencies, as the NID provides an integrated database of different information. This paints a murky picture of Nepal’s cyber security ecosystem, as data security is fragile, and hackers often target government websites. Ever since the launch of the Adhaar Card in India, there have been numerous cases of duping, misuse and information leak.

Two of the five small glacial lakes formed above the settlement burst, causing a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). GLOF occurs when a glacial lake breaches its natural dam called moraine—a pile of debris left behind by a glacier. The Thame incident has again centred people’s attention on mountains and climate change. We cannot help but remember a 2020 report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), which warned that 47 glacial lakes in Nepal, China and India are at high risk of bursting, 21 of them from Nepal alone. As alarming is the organisation’s 2023 report, which projects a threefold rise in GLOF risks across the Hindu-Kush Himalayas by the end of this century and peak GLOF dangers expected by 2050. These warnings should be enough for us to be serious about this matter. Such a crisis has been looming over us for a long time now, but our efforts to mitigate climate risks are far from adequate. Nepal has already witnessed 24 GLOFs, yet there aren’t enough disaster preparedness programmes, prevention methods, comprehensive risk mapping and risk assessments in place.

Such efforts must also be scaled up in other high-risk lakes, and monitoring teams and early warning systems should be administered in such areas.

We have the opportunity to discuss the crisis in the upcoming COP29 and lobby for a significant share of Loss and Damage Funds. The minimal funds the government allocates for climate change-related issues can never cover the severity we face. Developed countries and international organisations are duty bound to help Nepal with adaptation and mitigation strategies, apart from supporting risk assessments of GLOFs. As climate change has harmed us in ways that are both profound and perilous, the general public should also realise their roles in escalating the climate crisis and vow to lessen it by switching to environment-friendly practices.

In earlier times, anyone who talked of change in the party's leadership, strategies or ideological standpoints would be forced to leave the party altogether—Mohan Baidya, Baburam Bhattarai and Netra Bikram Chand are in case.

And with coalition change for making and breaking governments seemingly being the only definition of change for the party now, there are obvious misgivings about Dahal's leadership. Moreover, with the recent breakthrough in the Transitional Justice Act, there are new hopes for a fairly acceptable, if not entirely successful, culmination of the peace process. A post-peace Nepal would certainly seek a new dispensation across political parties.

Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  ","summary":"CPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021.

But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on.

Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on.

He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey.

Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. ","summary":"Within days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities.

The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource.
