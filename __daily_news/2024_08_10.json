It could make Nepal more dependent on fossil fuels. This despite the country having abundant renewable energy in the upcoming years to power the transport sector as well as energy-efficient electric stoves in its kitchens.On the one hand, commitments are made in different high-level global forums to adopt green energy, and on the other, petroleum pipelines are being built. Chandi Prasad Ghimire, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, said that Minister Damodar Bhandari met Hardeep Singh Puri, minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, India, during the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in New Delhi on Wednesday and shared the news about the agreement on the petroleum pipeline projects.âWe were unclear about funding modalities. But now itâs clear that all three projects will be built by the Indian government on grant.âThe agreed projects are an oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa; a greenfield tank terminal in Charali; and an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan.The estimated cost of these projects is Rs17 billion.Nepal has also proposed a cross-border liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline. âThe funding modality of the LPG pipeline is yet to be decided,â said Ghimire. An energy expert working in a government project, who wished not to be named, told the Post that building an LPG pipeline is another blunder. âNepal will see a considerable amount of electricity generation that could substitute cooking gas and reduce trade deficit,â he said.âBuilding new pipelines free of cost means Nepal has to sign a long-term fuel import agreement with India to raise the construction cost.âNepal aims to increase clean energy generation to 15,000 MW by 2030 and plans for it are on track.Experts say it's a double standard.Ram Prasad Dhital, an energy expert, told the Post last December that billions of rupees spent on pipeline projects will go to waste. According to him, there is an immediate need to decarbonise the transport sector, and most countries, including Nepalâs two immediate neighbours, are already moving in that direction.Whatâs the rationale behind investing in the oil pipelines, experts have questioned.While the Nepal government has committed to net-zero emissions by 2045, it is building the petroleum pipeline.The new petroleum pipelines and storage tanks will increase Nepalâs dependence on fossil fuel, said Bhushan Tuladhar, an environmental expert.âThis kind of policy discourages energy transition. If we have the strength of green energy, we should promote it. We should not rely on fossil fuels, which we donât produce,â Tuladhar added.Nepal imports petroleum products worth Rs337.34 billion, which comes to nearly 20 percent of the countryâs total import bills. Tuladhar said Nepal needs to substitute fossil fuels with green energy to reduce the ever-growing trade deficit.He said that instead of investing in fuel pipelines, the government should invest in renewable hydropower, cross-border energy trade and installation of charging stations for EVs.To fulfil the net-zero emission commitment by 2045, the government has also introduced an ambitious hydropower roadmap.In the transport sector, Nepal has launched a strategy to increase the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) to 90 percent of all private passenger vehicles, including two-wheelers, sold and 60 percent of all four-wheeler public passenger vehicle sales by 2030.Massive tax waivers have been given on EV imports to promote electricity and reduce fossil fuel imports.The agreement to build the oil pipeline projects even if it is fast tracked, may take five to six years. And by that time, a rough estimate shows that electricity generation and EV sales would take a quantum leap. In the first 11 months of this fiscal year, EV sales have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Nepal imported fossil fuel-consuming 10,310 units of passenger vehicles worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billion.Tuladhar said Nepalâs private sector is aggressively investing in the hydro sector, and the governmentâs investment in petroleum infrastructure could be a setback for them as well as the country.The government has also set a goal of installing 500,000 improved cooking stoves, primarily in rural areas, and an additional 200,000 household biogas plants and 500 large-scale biogas plants.Nepalâs strategy is to have electric stoves as the primary mode of cooking in 25 percent of households by 2030.It is estimated that to meet the target, Nepal would need to invest $25 billion.Nepali politicians have been making many promises to switch to clean energy.Last December, then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal attended the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28) in Dubai and spoke on climate finance Nepal seeks from the international community.In his speech at the summit, Dahal said, âNepal is fully committed to the Paris Agreement. We are committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, five years earlier than the global target. We will fully utilise our hydropower potential to secure clean energy and maintain 45 percent forest-covered land.âBefore attending COP28 in May, Dahal and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to build two cross-border pipelines and one petroleum tank with grants from the Indian Oil Corporation during Dahal's visit to New Delhi, India. In New Delhi, two ministers discussed building the Motihari-Sarlahi LPG pipeline, said Ghimire. âThe agreement for this project will soon be finalised. We have requested the Indian government to build the LPG pipeline on grant.â Ghimire said that these projects will contribute to reducing the transportation cost.The construction work may start within 2-3 months.âOur commitment to reducing carbon emissions on international forums and building petroleum pipeline projects donât match. But we donât have any alternative to meet the energy demand right now.â he said. âSo, we need a few petroleum projects.âExperts, however, question what the country will do with the hydro energy the government and the private sector are producing with billions of dollars of investment. The pipe-line project may take 5-6 years to complete and there seems to be no plan to substitute petroleum imports. âThe government's policy is to increase the use of electricity, but supply is unreliable,â Ghimire said. Experts, however, questioned whether the electricity supply will remain unreliable even after five years. âSomething is cooking here,â they say.

The protesters had issued an ultimatum to the ruling coalition for his removal. As the coalition paid no heed, they marched to Kathmandu from their hometown to put pressure on the top leaders in the national capital.Kurmi, a Congress leader and Provincial Assembly member in Lumbini, is the prime accused in Nirmala Kurmiâs disappearance and capture of her property. Nirmala, a resident of Banke district, disappeared mysteriously in 2010, and remains missing.The protesters have made demands for Badshahâs immediate removal as minister, registration of a court case against him, and assurance of security for the protesters. Badshah, minister for Forest and Environment in the Lumbini government, is second in the Cabinet hierarchy after Chief Minister Chet Narayan Acharya of the CPN-UML.The protesters walked barefoot from Kalanki to Maitighar before commencing their indefinite sit-in at Maitighar. This is the fourth time they have been in the federal capital demanding justice for Nirmala.âA prime accused in a heinous crime has become a minister. How can we expect justice when the person, who should be facing prosecution, occupies high office?,â Khan told the Post. âThis shows how insensitive this government and our political parties are.â She said successive governments, by refusing to implement past deals, have proved that they are not accountable to the people and not bothered about rule of law. United under Mahila Adhikar Manch, Banke, the group of activists has been continuously protesting for over three years demanding justice for Nirmala.In October 2021, a group of 14 people, including 11 women, arrived in Kathmandu from Nepalgunj, covering over 500 kilometres on foot in the quest for justice for two womenâvictims of murder and disappearances. They had to march to Kathmandu after the local administration paid no attention to their protest.After 12 days of sit-ins and a hunger strike, the government had agreed to investigate the murder of Nakunni Dhobi and Nirmala Kurmi, who disappeared mysteriously in 2010. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba was the prime minister at the time.Badshah Kurmi, a Congress leader and Provincial Assembly member in Lumbini, is the prime accused in Nirmalaâs disappearance and capture of her property. Ignoring the agreement his party had signed with Ruby Khan, who is in charge of Mahila Adhikar Manch, Banke that staged the protest, the Congress fielded Badshah in the provincial assembly elections in November 2023. He won.One and a half years later, on July 23, the countryâs biggest party made him a minister in the province. The Congress has rewarded him, while it is the governmentâs responsibility to implement past agreements. The Ministry of Home Affairs, led by Ramesh Lekhak of the party, has sealed two agreements with Khan: the first in January 2022 and the next on June 25.After around three weeks of protest, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government had reached a five-point deal with Khan in the last week of June. This included completing the investigation of Nirmalaâs disappearance without delay. Based on the agreement in October 2021, the government had formed a committee led by Hira Lal Regmi, then a joint-secretary at the home ministry. The committee, in its report submitted to erstwhile minister for home affairs Bal Krishna Khand, had recommended the arrest of, and investigation into, eight people for their alleged involvement in disappearing Nirmala.The police arrested seven, who were later released, but they never arrested Badshah Kurmi. Badshah was also a Constituent Assembly member and an influential Congress leader in Banke.With the governmentâs reluctance to implement the Regmi panelâs recommendation, Khan, accompanied by 15 others, walked to Kathmandu on foot from Banke and started a sit-in in the Capital on November 25, 2021. They withdrew their protest on the 42nd day, after the government agreed to get the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police to investigate Kurmiâs disappearance, implement the home ministryâs probe report and provide security to the protesters.Nirmala, 52, had gone missing in January 2010 from Janaki Rural Municipality in Banke. Her disappearance came to light two years after her two teenage sons were murdered in the span of a week. Khan has been demanding Badshahâs arrest.Khan said they will not give up the protest so long as Badshah remains minister. Human rights defenders supporting their movement say the government must be honest towards implementing past agreements.âAll major parties, when they were in the government, came to agreements with the protesters. It is their responsibility to implement the deals,â Mohna Ansari, a former member of the National Human Rights Commission, told the Post. Following the governmentâs reluctance to abide by its deals, the constitutional human rights watchdog in June had directed it to present a progress report on the agreements. âIt has come to light that the investigation committee under the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2021 recommended probing the cases after arresting the accused. However, the past agreements between the government and the protesters have not been implemented. The home ministry is asked to report within seven days explaining the progress in implementing the agreements,â the commission had said.The government has ignored the directive. âWe have not received any response,â Shyam Babu Kafle, chief at the investigation department at the commission, told the Post.Â  ","summary":"A group of Banke-based human rights activists led by Ruby Khan started a sit-in at Maitighar in Kathmandu on Friday, demanding immediate removal of Badshah Kurmi as minister from the Lumbini provincial government.They started the protest as the Nepali Congress and the ruling alliance appointed Badshah as a minister, ignoring their warning. The protesters had issued an ultimatum to the ruling coalition for his removal. As the coalition paid no heed, they marched to Kathmandu from their hometown to put pressure on the top leaders in the national capital.Kurmi, a Congress leader and Provincial Assembly member in Lumbini, is the prime accused in Nirmala Kurmiâs disappearance and capture of her property. Nirmala, a resident of Banke district, disappeared mysteriously in 2010, and remains missing.The protesters have made demands for Badshahâs immediate removal as minister, registration of a court case against him, and assurance of security for the protesters. Badshah, minister for Forest and Environment in the Lumbini government, is second in the Cabinet hierarchy after Chief Minister Chet Narayan Acharya of the CPN-UML.The protesters walked barefoot from Kalanki to Maitighar before commencing their indefinite sit-in at Maitighar. This is the fourth time they have been in the federal capital demanding justice for Nirmala.âA prime accused in a heinous crime has become a minister. How can we expect justice when the person, who should be facing prosecution, occupies high office?,â Khan told the Post. âThis shows how insensitive this government and our political parties are.â She said successive governments, by refusing to implement past deals, have proved that they are not accountable to the people and not bothered about rule of law. United under Mahila Adhikar Manch, Banke, the group of activists has been continuously protesting for over three years demanding justice for Nirmala.In October 2021, a group of 14 people, including 11 women, arrived in Kathmandu from Nepalgunj, covering over 500 kilometres on foot in the quest for justice for two womenâvictims of murder and disappearances. They had to march to Kathmandu after the local administration paid no attention to their protest.After 12 days of sit-ins and a hunger strike, the government had agreed to investigate the murder of Nakunni Dhobi and Nirmala Kurmi, who disappeared mysteriously in 2010. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba was the prime minister at the time.Badshah Kurmi, a Congress leader and Provincial Assembly member in Lumbini, is the prime accused in Nirmalaâs disappearance and capture of her property. Ignoring the agreement his party had signed with Ruby Khan, who is in charge of Mahila Adhikar Manch, Banke that staged the protest, the Congress fielded Badshah in the provincial assembly elections in November 2023. He won.One and a half years later, on July 23, the countryâs biggest party made him a minister in the province. The Congress has rewarded him, while it is the governmentâs responsibility to implement past agreements. The Ministry of Home Affairs, led by Ramesh Lekhak of the party, has sealed two agreements with Khan: the first in January 2022 and the next on June 25.After around three weeks of protest, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government had reached a five-point deal with Khan in the last week of June. This included completing the investigation of Nirmalaâs disappearance without delay. Based on the agreement in October 2021, the government had formed a committee led by Hira Lal Regmi, then a joint-secretary at the home ministry. The committee, in its report submitted to erstwhile minister for home affairs Bal Krishna Khand, had recommended the arrest of, and investigation into, eight people for their alleged involvement in disappearing Nirmala.The police arrested seven, who were later released, but they never arrested Badshah Kurmi. Badshah was also a Constituent Assembly member and an influential Congress leader in Banke.With the governmentâs reluctance to implement the Regmi panelâs recommendation, Khan, accompanied by 15 others, walked to Kathmandu on foot from Banke and started a sit-in in the Capital on November 25, 2021.

However, a new book by Bishnu Prasad Gautam, âBibekko Filterâ, published by Shimal Book Publication, presents a broader analysis, indicating a deeper malaise throughout Nepali society.Gautam refers to this malaise as the widespread tendency among Nepalisâincluding intellectuals, business elites, and professionalsânot to use a âfilter of conscienceâ in their actions and inactions.Citing numerous examples from different sectors of Nepali society, the author documents how our educational system and customary practices encourage people to be conformists. Even bright, young professionals educated abroad, or those exposed to innovative ways of doing things better elsewhere, tend to conform to corrupt, lazy, and cynical practices in their native milieu in Nepal.The key message of âBibekko Filterâ is to encourage young people to use their filter of conscience to think positively, cultivate a can-do spirit, challenge the status quo and unhealthy conventional wisdom, and take responsibility as proactive agents of change for a better future.Reading the book reminded me of Karna Shakyaâs classic book on the power of positive thinking, âSochâ, and its sequels. With his lived experience in Nepal as well as in Japan and Canada and citing examples of figures like Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, and Steve Jobs from abroad and Nepalâs icons Sanduk Ruit, Mahabir Pun, and Anuradha Koirala, Gautam seeks to inspire Nepali youth to think and act positively.Think globally, act locallyNepalis are generally well-informed about national politics and quite opinionated about world affairs. The author cites many examples of how Nepalisâfrom school children to taxi drivers, priests and pundits, local politicians, and migrant workers abroadâtalk incessantly about the antics and intrigues of Nepalâs national political leaders and are quick to blame them for all the countryâs ills. However, we rarely find local leaders, whether political or professional, taking responsibility for solving regional problems within their sphere of influence.Nepali journalists also give undue prominence to the squabbles and foibles of our national political leaders. Their superficial speeches and inconsequential meetings get front-page coverage. However, innovative projects at the local level, whether governmental or private sector, rarely get the publicity they deserve.Nepalis quickly adopt global goals, ratify UN treaties and conventions, and embrace environmental standards and norms. However, these goals and standards are not always adapted to Nepalâs realities. The author points to several examples, such as adding too many unrealistic and unachievable targets to pursue sustainable development goals and unduly restrictive policies on not cutting trees or exploiting locally available construction materials that hamper legitimate development projects. He highlights the need to be more pragmatic and judicious in distinguishing between means and ends when implementing such policies.The author encourages us to take a more positive and balanced view of Nepalâs progress, not just meditate on our problems and failures. He argues that donât focus unduly on discouraging daily events; pay more attention to positive long-term trends. He urges young people to strive to be role models of problem-solvers and innovators, not relish in being eloquent complainers.Mixed messages and contradictions galoreThe book chronicles many cases of ordinary people and public officials failing to use their filter of conscience, thus perpetuating practices that are often obsolete, counterintuitive, and contrary to declared public policies. Examples include:People who complain bitterly about corruption but encourage and congratulate friends and relatives when they secure jobs in government offices known to be lucrative and rife with corruption. Leaders preach gender equality and womenâs empowerment in public speeches but send their sons to expensive private schools and daughters to mediocre public schools. As part of e-governance, we introduce an online application system for various services, but applicants are required to affix a physical postage stamp to their applications. Politicians and officials (including socialists of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist varieties) loudly criticise the privatisation of health and education. Still, they are often the biggest investors and owners of private schools, hospitals, and medical schools. Cartels and syndicates aligned with political parties usually lead the opposition to consumer-friendly alternatives and the introduction of new technology-driven innovations, such as in public transport. A stark example of the non-use of the bibekko filter is the functioning of studentsâ and teachersâ unions affiliated with major political parties. These unions rarely focus on improving the quality of education but are hyperactive in partisan political activities, often at the behest of their party bosses.Profiting from loopholesNepalis, including senior officials and well-to-do individuals, do not hesitate to take advantage of allowances and concessions meant for the poor, oppressed, and underprivileged groups. Examples include: We champion inclusion and proportional representation, but well-established political leaders from privileged backgrounds (including ministers and business tycoons from some of Nepalâs historically marginalised communities) nominate their family members, business partners, and donors to fill reserved quota seats meant for the genuinely underprivileged and underrepresented constituencies. Many Nepalis exaggerated the Maoist violence and the impact of the earthquake to seek asylum as refugees in Europe and North America. This even included a former Nepali ambassador and senior diplomat.Perpetuating known bad practicesLeaders often preach the need for efficiency, punctuality, and cost-effectiveness but perpetuate the opposite practices. Examples include:Excessive formalities exist in meetings and conferences. People wait hours for the arrival of the \"Chief Guest,â who is always late. Knowing this, other invitees also delay their arrival, wasting time and the notoriety of âNepali Time.â Mediocrity is readily accepted in our society. Promotions are given primarily based on seniority and longevity in service rather than competence, diligence, and achievement.We spend vast amounts on constructing new buildings and infrastructure and acquiring modern equipment in hospitals and offices but rarely undertake timely or routine maintenance. This leads to expensive repair costs, accidents, poor quality of services, and the premature discarding of expensive vehicles and equipment. Nobody is held accountable for such inefficiency. Instead of improving or updating existing institutions and services, we look for alternatives. Thus, instead of improving public schools, those who can send their children to expensive private schools. The same applies to health posts and hospitals. Due to this tendency, public officials feel free of pressure for accountability and quality improvement.A significant portion of Nepalâs budget is hurriedly spent in the last two months of our fiscal year, during the monsoon season, resulting in shoddy work known as AsarÃ© Bikash. Yet, we have not bothered to change our fiscal year.The author feels that these well-known bad practices could be readily fixed if we applied the bibekko filter.Progress is possibleThe book offers many lessons and suggestions based on the life experience of the author, who grew up in a relatively remote village of Gulmi but excelled in his studies as an engineer at some of the most renowned educational institutions in Kathmandu, Tokyo and Toronto, and worked in the Planning Commission of Lumbini Province.The author exposes many penny-wise and pound-foolish rules and practices in various sectors that impose undue burdens on consumers without appreciable benefits for the state. He highlights many laws, regulations, and practices formulated and implemented more for the convenience of bureaucrats and service providers rather than in the best interest of consumers. In all these problematic areas, the author shares his vision and practical proposals with a firm conviction that progress is possible and things can be significantly improved if our policymakers and administratorsâin both the public and private sectorsâapply a common-sense filter of conscience.

A stark example of the non-use of the bibekko filter is the functioning of studentsâ and teachersâ unions affiliated with major political parties. These unions rarely focus on improving the quality of education but are hyperactive in partisan political activities, often at the behest of their party bosses.Profiting from loopholesNepalis, including senior officials and well-to-do individuals, do not hesitate to take advantage of allowances and concessions meant for the poor, oppressed, and underprivileged groups. Examples include: We champion inclusion and proportional representation, but well-established political leaders from privileged backgrounds (including ministers and business tycoons from some of Nepalâs historically marginalised communities) nominate their family members, business partners, and donors to fill reserved quota seats meant for the genuinely underprivileged and underrepresented constituencies. Many Nepalis exaggerated the Maoist violence and the impact of the earthquake to seek asylum as refugees in Europe and North America. This even included a former Nepali ambassador and senior diplomat.Perpetuating known bad practicesLeaders often preach the need for efficiency, punctuality, and cost-effectiveness but perpetuate the opposite practices. Examples include:Excessive formalities exist in meetings and conferences. People wait hours for the arrival of the \"Chief Guest,â who is always late. Knowing this, other invitees also delay their arrival, wasting time and the notoriety of âNepali Time.â Mediocrity is readily accepted in our society. Promotions are given primarily based on seniority and longevity in service rather than competence, diligence, and achievement.We spend vast amounts on constructing new buildings and infrastructure and acquiring modern equipment in hospitals and offices but rarely undertake timely or routine maintenance. This leads to expensive repair costs, accidents, poor quality of services, and the premature discarding of expensive vehicles and equipment. Nobody is held accountable for such inefficiency. Instead of improving or updating existing institutions and services, we look for alternatives. Thus, instead of improving public schools, those who can send their children to expensive private schools. The same applies to health posts and hospitals. Due to this tendency, public officials feel free of pressure for accountability and quality improvement.A significant portion of Nepalâs budget is hurriedly spent in the last two months of our fiscal year, during the monsoon season, resulting in shoddy work known as AsarÃ© Bikash. Yet, we have not bothered to change our fiscal year.The author feels that these well-known bad practices could be readily fixed if we applied the bibekko filter.Progress is possibleThe book offers many lessons and suggestions based on the life experience of the author, who grew up in a relatively remote village of Gulmi but excelled in his studies as an engineer at some of the most renowned educational institutions in Kathmandu, Tokyo and Toronto, and worked in the Planning Commission of Lumbini Province.The author exposes many penny-wise and pound-foolish rules and practices in various sectors that impose undue burdens on consumers without appreciable benefits for the state. He highlights many laws, regulations, and practices formulated and implemented more for the convenience of bureaucrats and service providers rather than in the best interest of consumers. In all these problematic areas, the author shares his vision and practical proposals with a firm conviction that progress is possible and things can be significantly improved if our policymakers and administratorsâin both the public and private sectorsâapply a common-sense filter of conscience.

Earlier in the day, the Maoist chief had sat down for a long chat with KP Sharma Oli, the leader of the CPN-UML, the biggest partner in the ruling coalition.Prachanda was sure he had âconvincedâ his fellow comrade to continue supporting the Maoist Centre-led government. If there were any doubts left in the prime ministerâs mind, Oli had deftly deflected them with a heart-tugging assurance: âIf we live, we will live together, and if we die, we will also die together.â So Prachanda could hardly believe his ears when Barsha Man Pun, his confidant and finance minister, rang him up near midnight to inform Oli had switched his allegiance and was now teaming up with Sher Bahadur Deuba to fashion a new government. Hadnât Oli promised him, just hours ago, that their fates were inseparably entwined? Subtly winning people over by telling them exactly what they wanted to hear was his signature strength: How could Oli pip the old persuasion master at his own game! No doubt, the main driver of the July 1st midnight deal was Oliâs desire to again be prime minister at the earliest. He knew Prachanda was untrustworthy and could change sides any time. Many believe Oli, all along, intended to ditch Prachanda midcourse after successfully driving a wedge in the Congress-Maoist Centre alliance just three months ago. Whatever the case, the UML top boss saw his chance and grabbed it with both hands. There were other factors, too. For someone with Oliâs bloated ego, it was unacceptable of Prachandaâthe 32-seat prime ministerâto go around boasting about his âmagic numberâ, when it was Oli with his 79 seats who had decided to bless the Maoist chief with another premiership. At the same time, Oli was spooked by new voices for an investigation into the Giri Bandhu tea estate scam, some of them emerging from within Prachandaâs coalition. A new power-sharing deal with the Congress would solve all these problems in one fell swoop. Starting on June 21, the day of the Rastriya Swatantra Partyâs tea party, Oli had already started searching for the right mediator to talk to Deuba. But why such secrecy around the agreement? Oli, in particular, insisted on watertight confidentiality, so much so that even Bishnu Paudel, a long-time Oli acolyte, was kept in the dark. Senior UML and Maoist Centre leaders kept rubbishing any prospect of a Congress-UML tie-up, even up until 11:30 pm, just half an hour before the agreement was inked. Oli feared that if word got of his coming back to power in Kathmandu, a certain neighbour he had been constantly needling over the past few years would throw cold water over his prime ministerial ambitions. Thus came into being one of the most secretive deals in Nepali political history. The midnight miracleâs rationale was slightly different for Deuba. He knew that whatever an eventual agreement stipulated, Oli was more than capable of reneging on his promise. (Currently, the deal is for the UML chief to serve for the first two years, after which Deuba will lead an electoral government.) But Deuba and his wife Arzu Rana seemed to have run out of options when Prachanda negotiated the return from India of Bechan Jha, a middleman involved in the scam to send fake Bhutanese refugees to the US. Apparently, had Jha spilled the beans, senior Congress leaders, including Rana, could have been implicated in the scam. Deuba had the added incentive of avenging Prachandaâs betrayal, just three months ago, of ditching him to join hands with Oli. Fate, he was assured, was on his side. A trusted guru had long ago assured the superstitious Congress leader of at least seven stints as prime minister. Having already served on five occasions, time was running out to capitalise on his good fortune. So, despite Oliâs fickleness, Deuba decided to take his chances. In the Congress, even the partyâs two general secretaries didnât have a clue about the impending agreement, as one of them, Gagan Thapa, later admitted. All this brings us back to the degree of control the leaders of the two largest parties in the country enjoy, not just over their parties but the countryâs government apparatus as a whole. They can do pretty much as they like and couldnât care less about the message this sends about their democratic credentials and, by extension, about the health of Nepali democracy. Despite all the âprogressiveâ changes following the 2006 April Revolution, Nepali politics is still centred on two menâthree if we factor in Prachanda as the third major power broker in town. The same could be said about the functioning of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Overlook for a bit the veneer of change represented by, for instance, having more elected posts, and these three entitled men continue to maintain an absolute grip on their parties. Even with two elected general secretaries in the house, Deuba runs the Congress as his fief. Oli, as prime minister, continues to lecture the UML rank and file on the dangers of having too much internal democracy. Despite random protestations against his leadership, Prachanda has been the uncontested one-man show in the Maoist Centre for three and a half decades. One of the pretexts of the July 1st two-party agreement is the need for urgent constitutional changes, most notably to limit the powers of smaller parties and reduce the number of proportional representation seats. They could be playing with fire. As many analysts have pointed out, many groups and communities are dissatisfied with the new constitution and if amendments are made for the benefit of certain groupsâread: old elitesâthe others whose rights and benefits are cut will revolt. The political big bosses in Nepal would have seen how, in next-door Bangladesh, a proposal to increase the quota for Sheikh Hasinaâs cronies in government jobs cost Hasina more than her job. The irate mob literally chased her out of the country. The comparisons with Bangladesh are inexact. Nepali elected leaders are perhaps better articulators of peopleâs aspirations than their Bangladeshi counterpartsâmaybe because unlike in Bangladesh they are elected in free and fair elections. The Nepali public sphere is more vibrant and its press freer. There is more room for peaceful venting of public frustration in Nepal than in anywhere else in South Asia. But there is also a big similarity with Bangladesh. The two Bengali begumsâand the military rulers before themâtreated their country as personal property and rode roughshod over democratic norms and values. This same sense of entitlement could eventually doom Nepalâs own entitled leaders.

Our mission was to observe the impact of climate change on children and their families. The children I met along the way were often small and underweight, stark indicators of Nepalâs high malnutrition rates, with 41 percent of children stunted and 29 percent underweight. As we traversed the rugged terrain, I encountered yaks and mules laden with provisions from Nepalgunj, destined to sustain the people of Karnali's remote districts.In 2011, a year prior, Nepal had embraced the ambitious goal of graduating from Least Developed Country (LDC) status. Scepticism abounded, but I believed there was no alternative if Nepal aspired to improve its childrenâs and their familiesâ lives. To exit the list of the then 46 LDCs, Nepal needed to combat poverty, malnutrition and the premature deaths of children and pregnant women and to increase investment for quality education, improved connectivity and increased productivity as well as trade competitiveness. The only viable path was multiplying the efforts by having a clear plan in sight.During a visit to Surkhet in 2023, I saw trucks roaring towards Karnaliâs hills and mountains, laden with supplies. In the past 12 years, Nepalâs development milestones have been remarkable. Motorable road networks now connect the entire country. The maternal mortality rate plummeted to 151 per 100,000 live births by 2023, under-5 child mortality had dropped to 28 per 1,000 in 2019, and stunting had decreased to 32 percent in 2019. Its per capita GNI reached $1300 in 2024 from $320 in 2009. The progress is undeniable. Not all roads to the countryâs prosperity are smooth. The country is experiencing a rising trade deficit; its merchandise trade balance negatively grew from $4,278 million in 2010 to $12,439 million in 2022. It has consistently performed weakly in the share of manufacturing to GDP, dropping to 5 percent in 2023. In the last two years, Nepal performed the worst in domestic revenue mobilisation, limiting finance for its sustainable development priorities. In the last fiscal year, approximately 0.7 million Nepalis left the country for foreign employment. However, Nepalâs non-traditional development pathways, along with significant growth in the service sectors, have become a new normal. International trade witnessed a shift from labour-intensive manufacturing goods to high-tech and digital services. As remittance inflows offset its trade deficit, the country can plan better to enable investment of remittances to enhance productive capacity and trade competitiveness in service sector focusing on digital services. The country can also tap into its improved status. In the World Bank category, Nepal is upgraded to lower-middle-income country status. On the UNâs multidimensional development parameter, the country is scheduled to exit the LDC category in 2026. The improvement in the countryâs international rankings and status not only sends off a message of market readiness and creditworthiness but also boosts national confidence. Backstopping this with a sovereign credit rating will boost investorsâ confidence, and concluding the transitional justice process, ensuring victims are at the centre, will place Nepal as a champion for both peace and development. Yet, progress comes with careful planning and honest implementation to manage the additional responsibilities. Nepal will face stricter international trade standards and lose access to certain international support measures and multilateral funds as a non-LDC. Impact assessments have estimated a post-graduation loss of around 4.3 percent of total exports. Overcoming these barriers will be a significant challenge. The next two years are crucial for Nepal to harness the momentum of LDC graduation as a pivotal point in its development trajectory.The Government has developed the Smooth Transition Strategy (STS) to navigate post-graduation transitions. Despite being the first generation of such strategies, Nepalâs STS outlines a clear roadmap for its actions as a developing country. The STS encompasses measures to enhance productive capacity, reform policies for multilateral trade compliance, create decent jobs, and uphold labour rights and environmental conditions for trade competitiveness. These actions align with global sustainable development goals, underscoring Nepal's commitment to international standards.However, Nepal's readiness will be tested in implementing the STS, which demands collective efforts and shared responsibility. Past cooperation between the government, its people, and development partners has been pivotal. Nepal has successfully navigated the peace process, mainly through its efforts and support from the international community. Drawing lessons from these experiences will be vital in charting a new development course.Collective efforts to implement the STS can be sparked through internal and external endeavours. Internally, the country must introduce and implement reforms in domestic policies to cope with new challenges. As a committed member of the multilateral system, Nepal can engage its development and trade partners in aligning domestic policies with multilateral norms. This openness will provide opportunities for the country to actively engage in external processes and to influence international financing and trade architecturesâa critical step in sustaining economic momentum post-graduation.As we cross the halfway mark for the Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations Secretary-General has called for a renewed social contract at the Summit of the Future in September. The forthcoming âPact of the Futureâ, among other agreements, emphasises the need for international financing and trading system reforms. Nepal, which champions principles of non-alignment, can play a crucial role in reshaping international rules to drive structural transformation of both LDCs and graduating LDCs. As chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of the LDCs and vice-chair of the UN Economic and Social Council, Nepal is also responsible for leading engagements with the international community.As we stand at the precipice of monumental change, the success of Nepal in capitalising on these global processes, such as its forthcoming graduation and the Summit of the Future, hinges on meaningful engagement with development and trade partners. The United Nations in Nepal is ready to support these efforts, and therefore, along with fellow Resident Coordinators, I am fostering collaboration among the graduating cohort of 2021âNepal, Lao PDR, and Bangladeshâand their dialogues with experts to smoothen the transitions. This transition demands transformative dialogues, policy reforms, and honest efforts to the implementation. Nepal stands at a critical crossroads, and the choices we make now will reverberate through the annals of history. We must rise to the occasion, for the future of our nation and the generations to come depend on our courage to forge a new prosperous path.

Its per capita GNI reached $1300 in 2024 from $320 in 2009. The progress is undeniable. Not all roads to the countryâs prosperity are smooth. The country is experiencing a rising trade deficit; its merchandise trade balance negatively grew from $4,278 million in 2010 to $12,439 million in 2022. It has consistently performed weakly in the share of manufacturing to GDP, dropping to 5 percent in 2023. In the last two years, Nepal performed the worst in domestic revenue mobilisation, limiting finance for its sustainable development priorities. In the last fiscal year, approximately 0.7 million Nepalis left the country for foreign employment. However, Nepalâs non-traditional development pathways, along with significant growth in the service sectors, have become a new normal. International trade witnessed a shift from labour-intensive manufacturing goods to high-tech and digital services. As remittance inflows offset its trade deficit, the country can plan better to enable investment of remittances to enhance productive capacity and trade competitiveness in service sector focusing on digital services. The country can also tap into its improved status. In the World Bank category, Nepal is upgraded to lower-middle-income country status. On the UNâs multidimensional development parameter, the country is scheduled to exit the LDC category in 2026. The improvement in the countryâs international rankings and status not only sends off a message of market readiness and creditworthiness but also boosts national confidence. Backstopping this with a sovereign credit rating will boost investorsâ confidence, and concluding the transitional justice process, ensuring victims are at the centre, will place Nepal as a champion for both peace and development. Yet, progress comes with careful planning and honest implementation to manage the additional responsibilities. Nepal will face stricter international trade standards and lose access to certain international support measures and multilateral funds as a non-LDC. Impact assessments have estimated a post-graduation loss of around 4.3 percent of total exports. Overcoming these barriers will be a significant challenge. The next two years are crucial for Nepal to harness the momentum of LDC graduation as a pivotal point in its development trajectory.The Government has developed the Smooth Transition Strategy (STS) to navigate post-graduation transitions. Despite being the first generation of such strategies, Nepalâs STS outlines a clear roadmap for its actions as a developing country. The STS encompasses measures to enhance productive capacity, reform policies for multilateral trade compliance, create decent jobs, and uphold labour rights and environmental conditions for trade competitiveness. These actions align with global sustainable development goals, underscoring Nepal's commitment to international standards.However, Nepal's readiness will be tested in implementing the STS, which demands collective efforts and shared responsibility. Past cooperation between the government, its people, and development partners has been pivotal. Nepal has successfully navigated the peace process, mainly through its efforts and support from the international community. Drawing lessons from these experiences will be vital in charting a new development course.Collective efforts to implement the STS can be sparked through internal and external endeavours. Internally, the country must introduce and implement reforms in domestic policies to cope with new challenges. As a committed member of the multilateral system, Nepal can engage its development and trade partners in aligning domestic policies with multilateral norms. This openness will provide opportunities for the country to actively engage in external processes and to influence international financing and trade architecturesâa critical step in sustaining economic momentum post-graduation.As we cross the halfway mark for the Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations Secretary-General has called for a renewed social contract at the Summit of the Future in September. The forthcoming âPact of the Futureâ, among other agreements, emphasises the need for international financing and trading system reforms. Nepal, which champions principles of non-alignment, can play a crucial role in reshaping international rules to drive structural transformation of both LDCs and graduating LDCs. As chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of the LDCs and vice-chair of the UN Economic and Social Council, Nepal is also responsible for leading engagements with the international community.As we stand at the precipice of monumental change, the success of Nepal in capitalising on these global processes, such as its forthcoming graduation and the Summit of the Future, hinges on meaningful engagement with development and trade partners. The United Nations in Nepal is ready to support these efforts, and therefore, along with fellow Resident Coordinators, I am fostering collaboration among the graduating cohort of 2021âNepal, Lao PDR, and Bangladeshâand their dialogues with experts to smoothen the transitions. This transition demands transformative dialogues, policy reforms, and honest efforts to the implementation. Nepal stands at a critical crossroads, and the choices we make now will reverberate through the annals of history. We must rise to the occasion, for the future of our nation and the generations to come depend on our courage to forge a new prosperous path.

Again, most notably, on Wednesday the chiefs of all three parties jointly accepted the report and unequivocally committed to resolving the remaining task of the peace process.

In the prime ministerâs words, this time, the amendment to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act would be meaningful and the âremnants of the conflictâ will be dealt with once and for all. Chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who led the decade-long Maoist insurgency, and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, sounded as committed to finding closure. Much optimism based just on Nepali leadersâ words may not be warranted. But, at times, important political achievements have been possible when leaders of these three parties have joined hands. Signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, management of arms and army of the Maoist party, constitution promulgation in 2015, among other knotty issues related to the peace process, took place based on such understanding among these forces. A major but crucial task that remains pending is delivery of justice to the victims, as envisioned in the CPA all those years ago. Of the three parties, Dahal of the Maoist Centre and Nepali Congressâ Deuba often felt put under pressure to swiftly conclude the peace process, as these parties were directly engaged in the insurgency from opposite sidesâmuch more than the UML.

With Prime Minister Oli keen to conclude the process at a time of his government leadership, and Deuba and Dahal ready to capitalise on the rare opportunity, there could perhaps be no better time to take the peace process to its conclusion. That said, the agreement among the leaders of the three parties is not sufficient. They must not forget that all they are doing is ultimately aimed at the victims. If the victims feel they are not getting justice, completing the process would be meaningless.

We urge the major politicians to strive to address the concerns of these holdout victims while giving final touches to the amendment bill. Trying to ram the bill through Parliament without such effort would be ill-advised. Addressing the concerns raised by the Supreme Court in its past decisions and winning the trust of the international community is as important.

During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failureâa breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. âEnterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.âIn the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.âIf the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,â said Pathak. âThe washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.ââIn Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,â Pathak said. âNo one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.âA hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddhaâs birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after projectâs completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.âEvery year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,â said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. âThere is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,â said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airportâall dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport.

It is inappropriate for the parties that secure just one-and-a-half percent votes to be eligible for PR seats in the provincial assembly and those that win only three percent to secure their proportional seats in the federal parliament, Pokharel said in Dang on July 30. âSo we should increase the threshold to 10 percent.â The Nepali Congress and the UML, two biggest parties in the House of Representatives, agreed to lead the government by turns after they ousted the third largest party, CPN (Maoist Centre), which had been leading the administration after the November 2022 election. The two biggest parties in the country teamed up to install a new coalition, in an unusual democratic exercise.Political observers say one big reason the two parties came together was to install a two-party system. âIt was with political consensus that we kept a three percent threshold in our constitution,â Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. âOur constitution only recognises a multi-party system.âPeopleâs Multi-party Democracy, an ideology propounded by the late UML general secretary Madan Bhandari, also does not recognise a two-party system, he said. If the Congress and the UML bring in a two-party system, it will further worsen the countryâs political climate, the political scientist said. The Congress and the UML are said to have an understanding to amend the constitution so that only a few parties are represented in the provincial assemblies and in the federal parliament. They are also said to be in favour of proportional representation from the House of Representatives.For that, the constitution needs to be amended. As amending the constitution is a complex process, there are instead plans to amend laws related to the political parties, claims a Maoist Centre leader.By amending such laws, the Congress-UML coalition wants to take the country to a two-party system, Maoist Centre leader Lekhnath Dahal told the Post. âHowever, we will make sure that does not happen.âRam Datta Pandey, assistant spokesperson for the Election Commission, said they are working to amend the laws related to political parties. The commission has discussed the matter with various stakeholders, Pandey told the Post. âIt is still unclear whether we will change the threshold provision while amending the laws related to the political parties.âPandey added that since changing the vote threshold percentage is a political issue, the commission alone cannot do it. Dahal of the Maoist Centre claimed that the two major parties reached a seven-point deal before forming the Oli government on July 1âa document that is yet to be made public. âPrime Minister Oli read out seven points of an agreement during his floor test on July 21,â Dahal said. âBut why has he not made public the original paper with the signatures of the two leaders?â Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML chair Oli signed an agreement days before the UML withdrew its support to the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on July 3.Increasing the threshold would be a regressive move, says a rights activist. Democracy gives all political parties the space to grow, Govinda Chhantyal, a long-time advocate for greater representation of ethnic groups, told the Post. âIn our current federal structure, the Centre should be helping the regional parties to flourish instead of trying to snuff them out.â The two-party system cannot guarantee political stability, as the leaders of major parties advocate, Chhantyal argues. âIf that were the case, why would the Nepal Communist Party, which had nearly a two-thirds majority after the 2017 election, fail to bring stability to the country?â ","summary":"The ruling Congress-UML coalition plans to amend laws to increase the vote threshold for political parties, raising concerns about a return to a two-party system and the suppression of smaller parties."},{"hash":"a2e8d9a35b9f3841397bfbf6cad7c612a26254f88491021cc75325bd84688659","title":"Top leaders promise to approve changes to the transitional justice law.","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/08/08/top-leaders-vow-to-pass-transitional-justice-law-amendments","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/11111-1723080496.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1723075200000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"Nepal's three main political parties have agreed on a new law to finish up a commission that looks into human rights abuses during the civil war.\n\nThe law will list rape, murder, enforced disappearances, and torture as serious crimes that cannot be pardoned, while other crimes can be forgiven.\n\nIn some cases, like when the person admits to the crime or helps with the investigation, the sentences can be reduced by up to 75%.\n\nThe law will also give money to former Maoist soldiers and families of security personnel who died or were injured during the war.\n\nThe bill will now go to Parliament for approval, and since the three parties control more than two-thirds of the seats, it is expected to pass.","summary":"Top leaders of Nepal's major parties unanimously endorse a bill amending the transitional justice law, agreeing on criteria for amnesty and punishments for human rights violations committed during the country's civil war."},{"hash":"584aff11e54e89393d5ddf7c75b5a33ef01376a139fc30ede31e84d6ea2766db","title":"Congress Central Committee will discuss reports submitted by Mahasamiti.","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/08/08/congress-central-committee-to-dwell-on-reports-forwarded-by-mahasamiti","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/default/thumb-1723079201.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1723075200000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"**Nepali Congress Central Working Committee Meeting**\n\n**Discussion:**\n\n* Reports from the Mahasamiti meeting (policy, organization, etc.)\n* Thapa's proposal to contest future elections without alliances (amended by office bearers)\n* Maoist-related issues: party's losses during insurgency, suppression of Hindu minorities in Bangladesh\n* Foreign affairs: briefings by Foreign Minister\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n* Approval of Mahasamiti reports\n* Discussion and possible updates to Thapa's proposal and other reports\n\n**Other Matters:**\n\n* Expression of support for Bangladesh and restoration of peace and democracy\n* Call for government action to protect Nepali citizens affected by unrest in Bangladesh\n* Request to consider making Nepal a Hindu state again","summary":"Nepali Congress's Central Working Committee discusses reports, including Thapa's proposal on contesting elections alone, Khadka's statement on Maoist insurgency, and foreign affairs updates."},{"hash":"bcf13c487c89896535be892712bbc4ae0dd892d64a39b6703223e8d94381d3b6","title":"Ranjitkar community brings back the lost Lakhe dance after a century.

While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadiâs scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.âI donât know if I can call the footpaths accessible,â Dawadi says. âThere is tactile paving for white cane users but itâs not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.âHer experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isnât entirely critical; she appreciates the KMCâs sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesnât just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. âThey need options that wonât affect their income; a crackdown wonât work.âDawadi emphasises that KMC shouldnât view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure âdisabled-friendly.â Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. âPeople with disabilities should be involved in planning,â she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.âOn many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,â he explains. âThe footpath has become just a showpiece.âRishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmanduâs footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministryâs Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMCâs recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishiâs organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.âThe constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,â Adhikari said. âForget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.âRishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, âforcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.â This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.âDespite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,â Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. âThis reflects a major failure of the stateâs duty,â he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the countryâs road infrastructure. âWe donât know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,â she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. âWithout clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, itâs hard for us to find our destinations,â Ray says. âAs I canât hear, I rely on signs for guidance.âRay also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. âCrossing the road can be chaotic,â he notes. âWith drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.âRay was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didnât suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMCâs new footpaths and railings are a step forward but âthey are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.âAccording to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term âdisabled-friendlyâ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an âinclusivity checklistâ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. âWhat about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?â he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, âStates Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.âDespite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. âThereâs no guidance or facilities for us,â she said.Shrestha criticises the KMCâs approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. âConstruction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,â he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. âWhile weâre committed to making footpaths accessible, weâre not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,â he said.âWeâve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we canât address every issue alone.âBaburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. âWe are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,â he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.âWeâve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmanduâs pavements and roads, but that doesnât mean theyâre not problematic,â Kumal says. âAccessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.â ","summary":"In Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions.

Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishiâs organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.âThe constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,â Adhikari said. âForget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.âRishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, âforcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.â This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.âDespite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,â Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. âThis reflects a major failure of the stateâs duty,â he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the countryâs road infrastructure. âWe donât know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,â she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. âWithout clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, itâs hard for us to find our destinations,â Ray says. âAs I canât hear, I rely on signs for guidance.âRay also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. âCrossing the road can be chaotic,â he notes. âWith drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.âRay was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didnât suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMCâs new footpaths and railings are a step forward but âthey are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.âAccording to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term âdisabled-friendlyâ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an âinclusivity checklistâ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. âWhat about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?â he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, âStates Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.âDespite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. âThereâs no guidance or facilities for us,â she said.Shrestha criticises the KMCâs approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. âConstruction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,â he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. âWhile weâre committed to making footpaths accessible, weâre not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,â he said.âWeâve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we canât address every issue alone.âBaburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. âWe are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,â he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.âWeâve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmanduâs pavements and roads, but that doesnât mean theyâre not problematic,â Kumal says. âAccessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.â "},{"hash":"3729b5399e077a021a4b0d95c822148ba0dbfa2333acc8d21c5ae59df7782c77","title":"kmc-resumes-sidewalk-widening-at-new-road-after-high-court-ruling","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2024/07/18/kmc-resumes-sidewalk-widening-at-new-road-after-high-court-ruling","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/footpathexpansion-1721285556.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1721260800000,"source":"kp","category":"valley","content":"The Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday.

We need to find a way to prevent future accidents and bring officials responsible for such utter negligence to justice,â said Raj Kishore Yadav, the committee chairman.Many lawmakers have echoed these concerns, calling for the prosecution of responsible officials. They have criticised the civil aviation regulator for its apparent negligence. The order means Nepal has formally initiated judicial proceedings through a separate investigation commission, which can hold the airline companies, the regulator, aircraft manufacturers, pilots, engineers, and others accountable for gross negligence and misconduct that have resulted in loss of life.âThatâs a landmark order. But there are no specific laws in Nepal under which the guilty can be prosecuted,â said Rajan Pokhrel, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. âThe Civil Aviation Act talks about judicial proceedings, but there is no law to enforce them.âFor example, if a government-formed independent investigation commission recommends cancelling an airline companyâs licence for gross negligence, there will be a confusion about who will enforce the recommendation. In Nepal, the results of accident investigations are not admissible in court and do not result in fines or other consequences.However, in many countries, investigations are typically conducted in two different ways. For example, in France, a pair of investigations are simultaneously conducted: the judicial investigation is directed by a prosecutor or undertaken under his control, and the safety investigation is conducted by the Bureau d'EnquÃªtes et d'Analyses (BEA).These two investigations have different objectives. The judicial inquiry aims to determine fault that may result in liability being established and, thus, convictions.The BEA investigation aims to improve aviation safety for passengers and crews. Unlike judicial investigations, the safety investigation does not presuppose the existence of a misdemeanour or a crime.The BEA investigation follows international rules from the ICAO. The judicial inquiry is based on national law and is undertaken under wildly varying conditions from one country to another. Thus, in some countries, the judicial investigation only starts after the safety investigation.Although in France these investigations are independent of each other, the law has determined their relationship. Thus, for example, flight recorders are placed under seal by the judicial authorities and handed to the BEA to be read out under its control. Further, regular contacts are established between the BEA and the authorities in charge of judicial investigations.The United States also conducts investigations in two different ways.In Nepal, under Article 26 of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, 1944, the government is obliged to institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the accident by the procedure recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Under Nepalâs Civil Aviation (Accident Investigation) Regulations, 2014, which follows Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the sole objective of investigating an accident or serious incident is to prevent accidents and incidents in the future. Therefore, Annex 13 investigations do not consider apportioning blame or liability.Any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability will be separate, as per Nepalâs Accident Investigation Regulations. âThe regulations and Act both talk about judicial or administrative proceedings, but there are no particular laws to enforce the results,â says Pokhrel.However, lawyers say it doesnât stop them from filing criminal charges and unlimited liabilities.Amrit Kharel, an advocate who has filed criminal charges against the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal and Yeti Airlines accusing them of gross negligence that killed 72 people in Pokhara in January 2023, said, âIn our territory, itâs our sovereignty to file a case against any misconduct.âThe investigation commission under the ICAO Annex 13 is just a fact-finding committee. âBut if any person dies due to negligence, they should not be granted any amnesty,â Kharel says. Kharel has been fighting the case on behalf of the families of the US-Bangla Airlines Flight 211 that crashed in Kathmandu in March 2018, killing 51 of the 71 people aboard. Victims have demanded a total compensation worth Rs2.10 billion after the Bangladesh airlines and its insurers and reinsurers failed to provide appropriate compensation.âThe case of Yeti Airlines is also gross negligence by the company and the regulator. A criminal investigation is necessary as negligence is growing in Nepal and innocent people are dying as a result,â Kharel adds. He said that if the court finds a person or company guilty of a crime, itâs the stateâs responsibility to prosecute them. âNo separate aviation law is needed to prosecute the guilty.âOn January 15 last year, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed while approaching the new Pokhara airport. The Post also reported that flight calibration, which tests all equipment at the new airport, had yet to recommend landing from the west, the path followed by the Yeti flight.Experts at the time pointed out that the flight procedure was not published, and the airline had very little information on airport procedures and data.No evaluation as required by the âsafety management systemâ carried out, either by the civil aviation regulator, as an airport service provider, or by the airline.âThe civil aviation body misused its regulator role to run the airport, neglecting safety requirements. It was a serious crime and mass murder, and subject to criminal investigation,â one aviation expert had said at the time.Speaking in the House on Thursday, Lawmaker Prabhu Sah said frequent crashes have sent the message that Nepalâs air safety is poor. âRelevant agencies should be held responsible and accountable for this. We cannot tolerate this any more. Officials take bribes and people die. The government that only takes the onus for positive things should also take responsibility for the growing corruption.â Though lawmakers who make laws have ordered a separate independent investigation commission to probe the frequent crashes, even if the commision produces the report, experts say, itâs unclear who will implement it.âLegal proceedings are indeed one of the effective measures to overhaul Nepalâs civil aviation,â said Sanjiv Gautam, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. âThere are few instances in which courts have prosecuted even the dead pilots for gross negligence.âIn a recent example, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners, angering the families of the hundreds of passengers killed who had wanted the case to go to trial.In October 2018, 189 people were killed when Lion Air Flight 610 fell into the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa airport, claiming 157 lives.Nepalâs civil aviation service started in 1953 with three old American-made DC-3 Dakotas belonging to an Indian company. After five years, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation was established.Nepalâs aviation sector has grown faster than expected, with passenger traffic climbing from one million to 10 million in just over two decades.

The accident comes just two weeks after the Saurya Airlines crash in Kathmandu that killed 18 people.This is the fifth helicopter crash in Nepal in two years. At least 41 crashes involving helicopters have been recorded across the country since 1979, including 20 fatal ones.On Wednesday, the air traffic controller gave a go-ahead for a 9N-AJD chopper belonging to Air Dynasty to fly from Kathmandu to Syaprubesi, Rasuwa, on the countryâs northern border, with four Chinese nationals on board.An on-duty air traffic controller said the chopper lost contact with the Kathmandu tower two minutes after takeoff at 1:54 pm. âThe weather was perfect. There was sunshine and no haze at Kathmanduâs airport.ââWe were informed about two trips.âBal Krishna Pandit, safety manager of Air Dynasty, said the flight was scheduled to take four Chinese nationals to the north, from where they would cross the border to their country. âOn the return flight, the chopper would bring from Syapru five Americans who had reached there after the Kailash-Mansarovar pilgrimage tour in Tibet.â âWe donât know the exact reason behind the crash, but an initial report shows a weather problem in the Shivapuri hills, even though it was clear in Kathmandu,â said Pandit. The chopper may have encountered an abrupt change in weather and entered a fast-moving fog. It then hit a small hill and crashed into the jungle.Post photojournalist Angad Dhakal, who reached the crash site after an hour, said the area was blanketed by a thick fog. According to him, the locals reported a âbig bangâ inside the bushes.âThe scene was horrific. Police were searching for missing body parts scattered over 50 metres.âThe chopper had been totally burnt, except for the tail.DIG Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police, said the bodies of four men and a woman were pulled from the wreckage. The chopper was flown by Captain Arun Malla, who also died.The crash site is in Suryachaur of Nuwakot district.Air Dynasty Heli Service is one of the oldest helicopter rescue companies in Nepal. It was founded in 1993 by Ang Tshering Sherpa, the owner of Yeti Group, who also died in an Air Dynasty helicopter crash in Pathibhara, Taplejung, in 2019. Along with him were tourism and civil aviation minister Rabindra Adhikari and a few top officials of the civil aviation body. In the past two years, there have been eight crashesâsix fatal. On May 29 2022, a Tara Air plane carrying 22 people crashed on its way to Jomsom from Pokhara, killing 22 on board. On January 15, 2023, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed in Pokhara, killing 72 aboard. On July 11 last year, a Manang Air chopper crashed near Lamjura in Solukhumbu district, killing everyone aboard, including five Mexican tourists and a Nepali pilot.On October 14, a helicopter of Manang Air flying towards Solukhumbhu came down in Lobuche. Captain Prakash Kumar Sedhai, who was injured in the crash, died while undergoing treatment in India. On July 24, a Saurya Airlines plane crashed at the Tribhuvan International Airport, killing 18 people. At least 124 people have died in air crashes in the past two years, which suggests that air safety in Nepal has truly gone for a toss.âItâs unfortunate, again. Unless we focus on strengthening the Safety Oversight system, these kinds of accidents will continue to happen,â said Rajan Pokhrel, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. âThe prerequisite to strengthening safety oversight is establishing a dedicated aviation regulator, which the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal is not.â Wednesdayâs crash is the eighth under Pradip Adhikari, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, and the fifth fatal one of his tenure.On Sunday, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and a group of party lawmakers met Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to discuss domestic air safety.âThe meeting was focused on tabling the civil aviation bills, which aim to split the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal into two entities: a service provider and a regulator,â said Rajendra Bajgain, one of the lawmakers.âThe way people are being killed due to regulatory failures amounts to a heinous crime,â he said.

The draft of the bills prepared by a consulting firm of former law secretary Raju Man Singh Malla and reviewed by the Tourism Ministry was registered in the National Assembly on February 23, 2020, after the go-ahead by the KP Sharma Oli-led Cabinet at that time.The two pieces of legislationâthe Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Bill and the Air Service Authority of Nepal Billâwere unanimously passed by the National Assembly on August 2, 2021.Since then, the billsâ tabling in the lower house has been blocked.âNow, the bills are back in the Oli Cabinet. It is the incumbent prime ministerâs moral duty to table the bills that the upper house has already approved. It is the fastest way to break up the civil aviation bodyâand to make the Nepali skies safer,â said Pokhrel. ","summary":"All five people on board an Air Dynasty helicopter were killed when it crashed on a hillside located some 11 kilometres northwest of Kathmandu on Wednesday. The accident comes just two weeks after the Saurya Airlines crash in Kathmandu that killed 18 people.This is the fifth helicopter crash in Nepal in two years. At least 41 crashes involving helicopters have been recorded across the country since 1979, including 20 fatal ones.On Wednesday, the air traffic controller gave a go-ahead for a 9N-AJD chopper belonging to Air Dynasty to fly from Kathmandu to Syaprubesi, Rasuwa, on the countryâs northern border, with four Chinese nationals on board.An on-duty air traffic controller said the chopper lost contact with the Kathmandu tower two minutes after takeoff at 1:54 pm. âThe weather was perfect. There was sunshine and no haze at Kathmanduâs airport.ââWe were informed about two trips.âBal Krishna Pandit, safety manager of Air Dynasty, said the flight was scheduled to take four Chinese nationals to the north, from where they would cross the border to their country. âOn the return flight, the chopper would bring from Syapru five Americans who had reached there after the Kailash-Mansarovar pilgrimage tour in Tibet.â âWe donât know the exact reason behind the crash, but an initial report shows a weather problem in the Shivapuri hills, even though it was clear in Kathmandu,â said Pandit. The chopper may have encountered an abrupt change in weather and entered a fast-moving fog. It then hit a small hill and crashed into the jungle.Post photojournalist Angad Dhakal, who reached the crash site after an hour, said the area was blanketed by a thick fog. According to him, the locals reported a âbig bangâ inside the bushes.âThe scene was horrific. Police were searching for missing body parts scattered over 50 metres.âThe chopper had been totally burnt, except for the tail.DIG Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police, said the bodies of four men and a woman were pulled from the wreckage. The chopper was flown by Captain Arun Malla, who also died.The crash site is in Suryachaur of Nuwakot district.Air Dynasty Heli Service is one of the oldest helicopter rescue companies in Nepal. It was founded in 1993 by Ang Tshering Sherpa, the owner of Yeti Group, who also died in an Air Dynasty helicopter crash in Pathibhara, Taplejung, in 2019. Along with him were tourism and civil aviation minister Rabindra Adhikari and a few top officials of the civil aviation body. In the past two years, there have been eight crashesâsix fatal. On May 29 2022, a Tara Air plane carrying 22 people crashed on its way to Jomsom from Pokhara, killing 22 on board. On January 15, 2023, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed in Pokhara, killing 72 aboard. On July 11 last year, a Manang Air chopper crashed near Lamjura in Solukhumbu district, killing everyone aboard, including five Mexican tourists and a Nepali pilot.On October 14, a helicopter of Manang Air flying towards Solukhumbhu came down in Lobuche. Captain Prakash Kumar Sedhai, who was injured in the crash, died while undergoing treatment in India. On July 24, a Saurya Airlines plane crashed at the Tribhuvan International Airport, killing 18 people.

Since the start of this year, the number of people infected with the virus has reached 2,365.Public health experts warn that the death toll and case numbers could go up further in the coming days. They criticise the authorities for their narrow approachâfocussing solely on counting cases and deaths, which does little to control the outbreak of the deadly disease.âThe authorities have neither conducted risk mapping nor taken measures to lessen the spread of the deadly virus,â said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. âCounting cases and deaths is not enough. Even the reported figures are far from reflecting the actual scale of the outbreak.âDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.âDengue virus is not like the coronavirus, which spread all over the world suddenly,â said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, an infectious disease expert who is also the administrative head of Dhulikhel Hospital. âWe can use the existing data for risk mapping, step up surveillance, and predict disease outbreaks accordingly.âExperts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. They say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the governmentâs case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Even symptomatic patients do not seek treatment at the hospital unless their symptoms get severe. What concerns them much is that many patients take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsâFlexon tablets, Nims, and Rynex, among othersâto cure body aches caused by the dengue infection. Using such drugs is very risky during dengue infection.Doctors warn that using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat dengue can increase the risk of internal bleeding, including in the eyes, elevate enzyme levels and damage the liver.Some patients who use NSAIDs in excess also suffer internal bleeding. Such patients need to transfuse platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate, according to them.Health agencies concerned have been shifting responsibilities to other agencies that are ill-equipped and lacking in both financial and human resources.âEvery day, 16 to 17 people in our district get infected with the dengue virus,â said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. Health agencies at the local level have been asked to launch a dengue search and destroy campaign and ramp up awareness about the risks.âExperts say most local units lack the budget and human resources to launch preventive measures. They say that a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. ","summary":"A bi-weekly situation update published by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division on Monday shows one death from the dengue disease and over 300 positive cases. Since the start of this year, the number of people infected with the virus has reached 2,365.Public health experts warn that the death toll and case numbers could go up further in the coming days. They criticise the authorities for their narrow approachâfocussing solely on counting cases and deaths, which does little to control the outbreak of the deadly disease.âThe authorities have neither conducted risk mapping nor taken measures to lessen the spread of the deadly virus,â said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. âCounting cases and deaths is not enough. Even the reported figures are far from reflecting the actual scale of the outbreak.âDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.âDengue virus is not like the coronavirus, which spread all over the world suddenly,â said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, an infectious disease expert who is also the administrative head of Dhulikhel Hospital. âWe can use the existing data for risk mapping, step up surveillance, and predict disease outbreaks accordingly.âExperts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. They say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the governmentâs case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Even symptomatic patients do not seek treatment at the hospital unless their symptoms get severe.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I donât know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allenâs bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didnât have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesnât release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just rightânot too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. Itâs crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the bakerâs repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call âBliss Browniesâ.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugarÂ½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessityâa space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an âoasisâ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. Itâs a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.âIn developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,â says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyoneâqueer and non-queer alikeâto share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.âI didnât want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,â Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikariâs identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. âAt first, I didnât understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,â Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding oneâs identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldnât afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.âDuring my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,â Adhikari says.âThe time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.âFour years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022.

We are all human,â he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.âLike how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,â he says. ","summary":"In a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessityâa space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an âoasisâ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. Itâs a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.âIn developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,â says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyoneâqueer and non-queer alikeâto share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.âI didnât want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,â Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikariâs identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. âAt first, I didnât understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,â Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding oneâs identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldnât afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.âDuring my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,â Adhikari says.âThe time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.âFour years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the cafÃ© because of its welcoming atmosphere.âItâs heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like âDahi Chiura Khane din,ââ she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. âI hope more spaces like this can open in the future.

Itâs been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdainâs groundbreaking book, âKitchen Confidentialâ, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry.

Yet, pockets of the past remainâsmall, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in todayâs Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hourâs walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokanaâs historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the âKhokana Museumâ. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the areaâs history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean waterâa practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.Â  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot âAbout Dry Grassesâ, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happeningâto what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say âlifeâs turning point?â How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.âHow much oxygen do you need for the summit?â sounds more like âHow much do you need to hold on to life?â How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, âIs this journey worth this much?âI had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my fatherâs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered natureâs masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like âHow will I endure?â and âHow will I finish?â started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of âGodsâ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just thereâbefore and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled âMy Soul Beyond the Mountainâ.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my fatherâs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered natureâs masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like âHow will I endure?â and âHow will I finish?â started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of âGodsâ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just thereâbefore and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled âMy Soul Beyond the Mountainâ.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colomboâs Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resortâs expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the islandâs famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lionâs Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. âThatâs a better figure now as we are recovering.âThe travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the UkraineâRussia war, and Chinaâs zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the countryâs GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the worldâs best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.âTourism is gaining momentum,â says Somasiri. âThe British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.âJanuary-August is the peak season for foreigners. âFrom December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,â says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, âDon't take selfies with your back to Buddha.â Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.âThese infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the countryâs dry zone,â says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrewâs, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lankaâs hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as âLittle Englandâ. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sitaâs whereabouts.In Ella, Ravanaâs waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasnât crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galleâs 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.âThe main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,â says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.âWe have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,â added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. âWe have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,â says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.âThe other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,â says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki MandirâJanaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earthâthe Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10Â°c to 20Â°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki MandirâJanaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the worldâs third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the schoolâto quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. Itâs the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leaderâs birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidimâs lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldnât help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughterâsymbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932â1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interestsâas a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimesâgambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?âI remember once seeing a small board that read âJawalakhel Zoological Gardenâ,â Koirala says. âI donât know whether it was from Juddhaâs time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.âKoirala adds, âThere is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddhaâs time.âBirds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepalâs rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepalâs royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book âSocial History of Nepalâ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapurâs King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipurâs King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained âtiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deerâ¦ heron, peacockâ¦ pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.âJung Bahadur Ranaâs zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to âsupervise and inspect itâ. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddhaâs biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in âThe Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Ranaâ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmanduâs Rana community including Juddhaâs descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, SchÃ¶nbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the worldâs first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddhaâs inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled âCentral zoo in state of neglectâ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day âreceived a pair of leopards as a giftâ, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report âCentral Zoo Master Planâ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals âincluding deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmanduâ could be put into one compound in the âlonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhariâ.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patanâs King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zooâs layoutâexcept for the small plots of lands acquired laterâthat was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddhaâs zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosuresâthe southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddhaâs zoo house?âWe cannot tell for sure,â Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.âIn those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,â Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monalâfrom the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddhaâs zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shresthaâs account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungleâs kingâcreatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as giftsâappearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsherâs âShree Teen Juddha Mahimaâ published during Juddhaâs reign in 1943.âOne need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,â he writes. âIt will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.âAmong these incredible creatures, one reigned supremeâlion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungleâs king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddhaâs zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.âWhere bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,â Koirala says. âThese were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.âNear these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddhaâs place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zooâs entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddhaâs elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumariâs enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumariâs statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumariâs statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhelâs most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.âOn June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbarâ¦ the pond nearby looked very scenic,â says a Gorkhapatra news report titled âStatue installationâ dated July 5, 1935. âBecause it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranathâ¦ and moreover since an ideal womanâs statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.âLess than fifty metres from Karma Kumariâs statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zooâs meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zooâs lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?âI think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,â Subodh Rana said. âIt is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.âFor one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one âneed not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countriesâ suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatarsâa neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lionâs roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world cameâcreatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each otherâs joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddhaâs Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddhaâs Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. âAll books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,â Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. âI donât know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.âTranslating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepalâs book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the whoâs who of the world literature. Such endeavours havenât just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. âThese translations are poor,â Baral says. âTomes with 1200â1300 pages have been trimmed to 200â300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.âAnother popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.âWe have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,â Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The bookâs Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: âAchyut Koirala, who has a masterâs in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.âKoirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasnât just translated the book but has also done âcreative writingâ with it.âRich Dad Poor Dadâ, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books thatâs perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the bookâall unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, âAt this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.âBasanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. âBut how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!â Thapa wonders. âReaders who havenât read the original wouldnât know the faults in the translated versions.â Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ârecreateâ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslimaâs books are the major victimsTaslimaâs memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as âSangharshaâ, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the bookâs sequel as âPrem ra Jeevanâ. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslimaâs permission. âAbout a decade back, we didnât know how to ask for permission,â he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody elseâs work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslimaâs anthology of essays No Country for Women as âAaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhainaâ. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. âI have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,â Pradhan, who is also a childrenâs book writer, says. âI just copy-edited it upon request.âBishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. âWe translated the book long ago,â he says. âWe are still trying to get translation rights.âIndigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrarâs Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. âAfter I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,â Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Kheraâs You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the bookâs unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they donât even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that itâd be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the authorâs permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldnât demand much for translation rights given Nepalâs small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. âPublishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,â he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harariâs bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the bookâs translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguruâs Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. âThis phenomenon not just hampers Nepalâs fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the countryâs reputation in the global market,â Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. âWe donât have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,â he says. âNobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.â Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.Oneâs pain, anotherâs pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, âThis is a pirated copy and Iâm the author of this book.â The youth wasnât bothered and replied, âOkay, you can buy it at a discount.âThis anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehtaâs friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. âWe sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,â says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepalâs image internationally. âThere was a time when Bangladesh would be known as âpiracy kingâ,â he said. âNow there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.âAs tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.âAfter the governmentâs decision, we stopped importing books for a while,â says Shrestha of Education Books. âThe import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.âPirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesnât levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. âThe government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the countryâs economy as well,â he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House Indiaâs sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. âTo confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,â Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, âKeeping ISBN number at oneâs will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.âBy the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrarâs office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Actâs clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Actâs subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Actâs clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the âimportation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.âIf anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provisionâs implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. âCreation is a crucial part of humanityâs benefit,â he says. âIf intellectual property is not protected effectively, then thereâd be no inspiration to create something.âBal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.âIn the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,â Mukhiya says. âBut in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.â(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

Voices on the opposition benches are that old foxes of Nepali politics were ruffled by the Dahal governmentâs sparing none in corruption cases policy, even those working closely with top politicians.Whatâs questionable are intentions, not issues. No informed citizen denies today that the country faces humongous challenges. For good or bad, nearly 4,000 Nepalis leave the country daily; those who return are far fewer. The countryâs farm and industrial outputs are way short of its domestic requirements. Thereâs a gloom in the jobs sector and wages are stagnant, even falling.The constitutional dynamiteNepalâs new constitution will mark a decade next year. Feared to fail from its inception, it still cries for full ownership at home and the goodwill of the countryâs all-dominant southern neighbour. The Congress and the UML are blaming it, rather than their own waning popularity, for the countryâs federal and provincial legislatures, where no single party currently has a majority and government changes have been too frequent.Tampering with the constitution may be akin to opening Pandoraâs box. After years-long negotiations, the three major parties had hastily sealed it in 2015.There are several misgivings about the new political order. The Hindu hardliners arenât happy with the secular state. The ethnic groups or janajatis arenât satisfied with how most of the provinces were carved out or named. Women need more equality in terms of representation. The provinces want more autonomy. However, the clamour for charter revision is only about the Congress and the UML maintaining their old hegemony.

This will surely draw up a strong bloc of parties opposed to such a scheme for spearheading a movement in a volatile situation. ","summary":"Nepali politics has been polarised in a new fashion, particularly after the July 1 deal between the two largest parties to form a governing coalition.While the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress, with most seats in the House of Representatives, teamed up to edge the Maoists out of the government, the pretext given was to tide the country over its âunprecedented crisis of public confidence in the governmentâ and a âhistoric low of hope in the general peopleâ.The opposition bloc led by preceding prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal of the Maoist Centre, with the Rabi Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party and Madhav Nepalâs Unified Socialist by his side, counters the narrative that the two parties joined forces to pull the country from the brink. Voices on the opposition benches are that old foxes of Nepali politics were ruffled by the Dahal governmentâs sparing none in corruption cases policy, even those working closely with top politicians.Whatâs questionable are intentions, not issues. No informed citizen denies today that the country faces humongous challenges. For good or bad, nearly 4,000 Nepalis leave the country daily; those who return are far fewer. The countryâs farm and industrial outputs are way short of its domestic requirements. Thereâs a gloom in the jobs sector and wages are stagnant, even falling.The constitutional dynamiteNepalâs new constitution will mark a decade next year. Feared to fail from its inception, it still cries for full ownership at home and the goodwill of the countryâs all-dominant southern neighbour. The Congress and the UML are blaming it, rather than their own waning popularity, for the countryâs federal and provincial legislatures, where no single party currently has a majority and government changes have been too frequent.Tampering with the constitution may be akin to opening Pandoraâs box. After years-long negotiations, the three major parties had hastily sealed it in 2015.There are several misgivings about the new political order. The Hindu hardliners arenât happy with the secular state. The ethnic groups or janajatis arenât satisfied with how most of the provinces were carved out or named. Women need more equality in terms of representation. The provinces want more autonomy. However, the clamour for charter revision is only about the Congress and the UML maintaining their old hegemony. The rise of new forces threatens them, and they want to tame the tendencies of adventurist politicians like Maoist supremo Dahal or stub out the quest for power in Madhav Nepal by denying them opportunities to regroup or forge electoral alliances.A blamed factor in the current state of hung parliament is the low threshold for parties to claim their proportional representation seats.

Was it possible for a government to continue to stay in power after killing the country's future, for murdering ordinary citizens in cold blood? Was it possible for a leader to keep on denying the truth about these murders by her own direction, blaming them on her political opponents when the evidence is out in the open for all to see? Could any leader and cabinet be more detached from the pulse of the people, from the hearts of the youth?The outcome of the events of the last few weeks were inevitable. Even after killing more than 200 people in less than a week and with no let up from the protesters, Sheikh Hasina's obstinance prevailed. On August 4, the violence escalated to newer levels, leaving at least 93 dead.

The incredibly brave young people of this country have steadfastly stood up once again against the full force of an autocratic governmentâand won!But volatility is a constant in our reality; all too soon, things did take an ugly turn. The pent-up anger of people was displayed in the most distasteful way with the ransacking of Gono Bhaban, seen as the seat of a hated regime, setting of fire to the Bangabandhu Bhaban at Dhanmondi 32 and to police stations all over the country, and attacks on houses and businesses belonging to the Hindu community and on their temples. The feeling of jubilation was tainted by the violence which went on without any hindrance. After watching children, students and ordinary citizens being ruthlessly murdered by the orders of the government, the fury of the public is understandable. But violence cannot bring justice for violence.This is the message that the members of the Bangladesh Student Uprising Central Committee have voiced during their press briefing on Channel 24. They have categorically told their fellow protesters to be vigilant of those taking advantage of the situation, who have carried out arson attacks and vandalism in order to malign the movement. They asked everyone to be mindful of instigators and refrain from any kind of looting, arson, communal violence and protect all minority communities and public assets. They have insisted that their movement is peaceful and has brought about a national unity that transcends political party or religion. They promised to stand against any kind of communal violence.The clarity and determination of these young leaders is awe-inspiring.

They also form the government, endorse its budget, policies and programmes, sanction treaties and agreements, monitor government activities and address citizensâ concerns. This makes the government accountable to the people through parliament. However, the legislative role extends beyond law-making to ensuring that laws achieve their objectives.Therefore, the Post-Legislative Scrutiny (PLS) concept emerged to meet the intended objective. The Law Commission of the United Kingdom defines it as \"a broad form of review, the purpose of which is to address the effects of the legislation in terms of whether the intended policy objectives have been met by the legislation and, if so, how effectively.\"The Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD), in its 2023 manual, defines PLS as a systematic and structured process through which parliaments review the implementation and impact of legislation. This process helps parliaments understand what worked well and what did not, and identify the best way forward. PLS in the UKIn the UK, all House of Commons and House of Lords committees are free to conduct PLS work. The process involves a formal review of Acts three to five years after Royal Assent. A PLS memorandum is published by the competent department and submitted to the relevant House of Commons select committee, which then decides whether further inquiry is needed. The involvement of both parliament and the government in PLS ensures comprehensive scrutiny. Since March 2008, the cabinet office has produced detailed guidance for departments on PLS, and the Guide to Making Legislation was reissued in 2022, including specific guidance on PLS. This ensures that ministries and departments submit explanatory memoranda on laws to the concerned parliamentary committees, which then endorse them or conduct wider examinations as necessary.The best part of the UKâs PLS model is its collaborative approach, involving both parliament and government. This makes PLS a parliamentary activity with a comprehensive evaluation involving multiple stakeholders. The UK model highlights the importance of systematic and structured reviews, providing clear guidelines for evaluating legislation and fostering a culture of accountability and continuous improvement in law-making and implementation.PLS in NepalNepal adopts a bicameral parliamentary system with the House of Representatives (HoRs) and the National Assembly (NA), collectively known as the Federal Parliament. Article 104 of the constitution mandates each House to frame rules to conduct its business, maintain order during meetings and regulate the committeesâ constitution, functions and procedures. Based on this, both Houses have developed separate regulations to manage their activities.Nepalâs NA initiated PLS in 2018 by incorporating provisions for \"evaluation, study, and researching the implementation status of the Act\" in its regulation. The HoRs followed suit in 2022 by including provisions for evaluating the implementation status of laws within its jurisdiction. The legislative management committee has the authority for PLS in the NA, whereas in the HoRs, all parliamentary committees share this responsibility. The NAâs public policy and delegated legislation committee is tasked with researching delegated legislation, an integral part of PLS.There are 10 parliamentary committees in the HoRs and four in the NA. HoRs Rule 178 defines the role of these committees, including evaluating the implementation status of laws. The NAâs legislative management committee is specifically responsible for managing PLS issues, as clarified in Rule 147. Although the NAâs regulations do not specify a timeframe for PLS, the legislative management committee has set a procedure for evaluating laws that have been in force for at least three years.The NAâs regulations, Rule 147(1), allow for \"evaluation, study, and researching the implementation status of the Act.\" Rule 148(B)(c) provides directions to the government based on reports prepared after studying and researching the effectiveness of implementing Acts. This structured approach ensures that the NA can effectively oversee the implementation of legislation and make recommendations for improvements.In contrast, the HoRs initially did not have specific provisions for PLS. However, the 2022 regulations included a clause in Rule 178(J) that allows the evaluation of the implementation of laws. The HoRsâ regulation now states that concerned committees can evaluate problems in implementation, issues to be improved, or the significance of laws related to their jurisdiction, which have been in force for at least three years. Additionally, the Speaker is responsible for determining the procedure for evaluating the status of law implementation. The parliament secretariat has drafted the procedure and handed it to the Speaker; however, according to a secretariat official, it has not yet been issued.The legislative management committee of the NA has conducted PLS on five laws so far. Despite the initial lack of formal provisions in the HoRs, the Law, Justice, and Human Rights Committee conducted PLS on two laws in 2078 BS, based on the understanding that PLS is a parliamentary privilege.An example of PLS in practice is found in the Sports Development Act, 2077. Section 57 of this Act mandates that the Sports Ministry evaluate its effectiveness five years post-authentication. This provision, introduced during the bill's discussions and subsequent parliamentary processes, marked the first inclusion of a PLS clause in Nepali law. Since then, by the end of July 2024, 14 acts authenticated by the president have included PLS provisions, emphasising the growing recognition of the need for systematic legislative evaluation.Implementation challengesHowever, despite these advancements, Nepal faces challenges in implementing PLS. A report by the legislative management committee in 2023 indicated that the implementation status of directions from PLS reports is poor. Similarly, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives has not shown satisfactory execution of its PLS findings. Awareness of PLS among government ministries and bodies remains low, with many new bills lacking PLS provisions.Lessons from the UKSeveral recommendations can be drawn from both Nepali experiences and UK practices to address these issues. First, there should be uniformity in the terminology used across both Houses of Parliament. The NAâs \"evaluation of act\" is narrower than the HoRs' \"evaluation of laws.\" A standardised term like \"evaluation of implementation status of laws\" would align with international practices and provide more precise guidance.Second, parliamentary committees should evaluate acts and delegated legislation, incorporating these responsibilities within the broader framework of PLS. Additionally, government bodies must become more aware of the importance of PLS. Conducting seminars and training sessions can help make sure that PLS provisions are included in future bills.The legislative framework should also specify clear timelines for PLS. While the HoRs' regulations allow for PLS on laws in force for three years, the NAâs procedures are less explicit. Aligning these timelines will streamline the PLS process across both Houses.Furthermore, the Federal Parliament should maintain ultimate authority over PLS, allowing the government to conduct self-evaluations but reserving final quality assessments for parliamentary committees. This balance will ensure thorough scrutiny while maintaining accountability.Some Provincial Assemblies have now started using this tool. However, considering the coordination issues between the Federal Parliament and the federal government at the federal level, the Provincial Assemblies should first take the provincial government into confidence before proceeding with this work. Unless the provincial government takes full ownership, its full implementation is impossible. The Provincial Assembly and the government should work together.Nepalâs journey towards effective PLS can benefit significantly from the UKâs model. By fostering collaboration between parliament and the government, standardising procedures and raising awareness among government bodies, Nepal can enhance the effectiveness of its laws and ensure they continue to meet their intended objectives. Most importantly, continuously knocking on the government and parliamentary bodies, including the provinces, is essential. This process will succeed only by keeping them well-informed. Otherwise, it will not. Therefore, awareness programmes and training are the first and mandatory requirements.

This provision, introduced during the bill's discussions and subsequent parliamentary processes, marked the first inclusion of a PLS clause in Nepali law. Since then, by the end of July 2024, 14 acts authenticated by the president have included PLS provisions, emphasising the growing recognition of the need for systematic legislative evaluation.Implementation challengesHowever, despite these advancements, Nepal faces challenges in implementing PLS. A report by the legislative management committee in 2023 indicated that the implementation status of directions from PLS reports is poor. Similarly, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives has not shown satisfactory execution of its PLS findings. Awareness of PLS among government ministries and bodies remains low, with many new bills lacking PLS provisions.Lessons from the UKSeveral recommendations can be drawn from both Nepali experiences and UK practices to address these issues. First, there should be uniformity in the terminology used across both Houses of Parliament. The NAâs \"evaluation of act\" is narrower than the HoRs' \"evaluation of laws.\" A standardised term like \"evaluation of implementation status of laws\" would align with international practices and provide more precise guidance.Second, parliamentary committees should evaluate acts and delegated legislation, incorporating these responsibilities within the broader framework of PLS. Additionally, government bodies must become more aware of the importance of PLS. Conducting seminars and training sessions can help make sure that PLS provisions are included in future bills.The legislative framework should also specify clear timelines for PLS. While the HoRs' regulations allow for PLS on laws in force for three years, the NAâs procedures are less explicit. Aligning these timelines will streamline the PLS process across both Houses.Furthermore, the Federal Parliament should maintain ultimate authority over PLS, allowing the government to conduct self-evaluations but reserving final quality assessments for parliamentary committees. This balance will ensure thorough scrutiny while maintaining accountability.Some Provincial Assemblies have now started using this tool. However, considering the coordination issues between the Federal Parliament and the federal government at the federal level, the Provincial Assemblies should first take the provincial government into confidence before proceeding with this work. Unless the provincial government takes full ownership, its full implementation is impossible. The Provincial Assembly and the government should work together.Nepalâs journey towards effective PLS can benefit significantly from the UKâs model. By fostering collaboration between parliament and the government, standardising procedures and raising awareness among government bodies, Nepal can enhance the effectiveness of its laws and ensure they continue to meet their intended objectives. Most importantly, continuously knocking on the government and parliamentary bodies, including the provinces, is essential. This process will succeed only by keeping them well-informed. Otherwise, it will not. Therefore, awareness programmes and training are the first and mandatory requirements.

He added, for good measure, that even though such diktats had been issued in the past, this time he was dead serious. But then the chairperson is himself being accused of promoting factionalism. For instance, Bishnu Paudel, a trusted lieutenant of Oli, was made the finance minister on top of his responsibility of monitoring the partyâs organisational activities.

It might have worked to his advantage back then, yet if something like that happens again, Oliâs political stature is sure to be diminished. Oli as the partyâs custodian should be promoting healthy debates and discussions instead of trying to stifle dissent.

Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people donât have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandoraâs Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the societyâs mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress donât seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UMLâs style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the partyâs structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the partyâs top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oliâs Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oliâs working style.Why didnât the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime ministerâs office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oliâs leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end âunnecessary bargainingâ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I donât know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?Itâs true that all three party chiefsâDeuba, Oli and Dahalâare very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. Itâs like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didnât involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The partyâs central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didnât they oppose it at the meeting? I donât see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We canât backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we donât need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the partyâs image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders donât like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal arenât given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leadersâwhether the seniors or young onesâare becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders havenât spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Havenât the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they donât get an acceptable power sharing deal, they donât cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they arenât loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. ","summary":"Within days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oliâs leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the dealâs implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people donât have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandoraâs Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the societyâs mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress donât seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UMLâs style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the partyâs structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the partyâs top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oliâs Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oliâs working style.Why didnât the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime ministerâs office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oliâs leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end âunnecessary bargainingâ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I donât know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?Itâs true that all three party chiefsâDeuba, Oli and Dahalâare very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. Itâs like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didnât involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The partyâs central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didnât they oppose it at the meeting? I donât see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We canât backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we donât need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the partyâs image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted.

The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we havenât been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to peopleâs expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenonâranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan rangeâmakes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaskiâs Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japanâs Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures werenât as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesnât have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companiesâNTC and NCellâto transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department havenât changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we havenât been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we donât have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we donât even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Donât you think itâs already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we donât have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didnât have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecomsâNTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we canât focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why donât people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesnât match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isnât as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to peopleâs livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the âEarly Warning For Allâ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldnât limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this departmentâs organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource.

Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the countryâs leadership. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UMLâs rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isnât an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didnât the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two armsâcoercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you canât use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldnât do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public wonât listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got âpollutedâ when they worked in collusion with the capitalâs elites. We, too, got âpollutedâ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didnât accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two partiesâ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file wonât accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress canât lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Canât the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasnât prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the partyâs general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We havenât been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leaderâs integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldnât have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldnât have followed him.Our people donât listen to our leaders because they donât see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they arenât following us because they donât find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist partyâs support. They wouldnât have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoistsâ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional partiesâthe Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centreâdonât have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions canât replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesnât practise intra-party democracy canât enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you donât have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasnât been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that donât even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They donât have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, itâs a collaboration between opportunists. So, donât expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime ministerâs secretariat might have prepared a list of â100 important achievements of the governmentâ. But what is the governmentâs priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, wonât backtrack.Donât you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didnât even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we wonât get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarianâs lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you canât implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy.

As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties donât forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the countryâs two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 peopleâs movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UMLâs support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a âmagical numberâ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of âuse and throwâ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to peopleâs plight, the countryâs pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesnât get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepalâs geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forcesâ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forcesâ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didnât bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didnât talk about the prime ministerâs term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadnât even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the governmentâs policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns werenât addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didnât accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didnât trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didnât come with the intent of solving the countryâs problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that itâs been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, itâs not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and wonât touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism wonât be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They werenât severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isnât ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldnât properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasnât come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, ââsecularâ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.â But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesnât even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasnât been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We havenât worked on it in detail. We havenât reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So donât you think this affair is tricky?I donât think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.Thatâs not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. Itâs not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isnât a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We havenât reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ânational consensus governmentâ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesnât weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.Â  ","summary":"The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties donât forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the countryâs two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 peopleâs movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UMLâs support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a âmagical numberâ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of âuse and throwâ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to peopleâs plight, the countryâs pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesnât get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepalâs geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forcesâ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forcesâ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didnât bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didnât talk about the prime ministerâs term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadnât even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the governmentâs policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns werenât addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didnât accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didnât trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didnât come with the intent of solving the countryâs problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that itâs been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, itâs not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and wonât touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism wonât be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They werenât severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isnât ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldnât properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasnât come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, ââsecularâ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.â But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws.
