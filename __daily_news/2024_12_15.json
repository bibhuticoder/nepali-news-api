Indian tourists can access Muktinath, while Chinese tourists can reach Lumbini through this corridor, thereby establishing trilateral trade relations,\" Sharma explained.\nSince the corridor's expansion, large cargo trucks and buses transporting tourists have been arriving at Muktinath from Gaindakot via Jaiminidham, Baglung Kalika, and Panchakot. \nOnce the road paving is complete, significant traffic is anticipated in this area, making the corridor the shortest route for travelers entering Baglung, Myagdi, and Mustang from India.\nAccording to local resident Sanam Rana, the convergence of the Kaligandaki Corridor and the Mid-Hill Highway in Baglung will bolster the development of the tourism sector. \nIn the five years since the corridor's opening, various segments have been upgraded and paved rapidly. \nThe 495-kilometer corridor extending from Gaidakot to the Chinese border at Korala bprder crossing was inaugurated in 2076 BS with support from the Nepali Army, allowing Chinese tourists to visit Lumbini through the corridor.\nThe plan for the corridor, initiated 24 years ago, is now progressing towards realization. \nIt is being improved and blacktopped in two segments: the Gaidakot-Ramdi-Maldhunga section, which is 224 kilometers long, and the Maldhunga-Beni-Jomsom section, which spans 255 kilometers. \nOf the 240 kilometers in the Gaidakot-Maldhunga segment, 162 kilometers, or 67 percent, have been blacktopped, according to Kalpana Adhikari, Chief of the Kaligandaki Corridor Gaindakot-Maldhunga Project Office.\nThe corridor has simplified travel from Lumbini to Mansarovar via Muktinath, and campaigner Tikaram Dhakal anticipates that it will become even more accessible after the road paving is finished. \nWith the commencement of vehicle movement on the corridor, which directly links China and India, Indian pilgrims have started arriving at the renowned religious site of Muktinath in Mustang via the Ruru region.\nDhakal emphasized the need to create a conducive environment for bringing Buddhist pilgrims from China to Lumbini, the sacred birthplace of Lord Gautam Buddha. \nHe noted that the corridor was envisioned from Gulmi twenty-four years ago.\nThe corridor encompasses significant pilgrimage sites, including Triveni Dham, Devghat Dham, Keladi Dham, Ramdighat, Ranighat, Rudrabeni, Setiveni, Purti Ghat, Jyamrighat, Palpa Bhairabhsthan, Baglung Kalika, Galeshwor Dham, Kagbeni, Muktinath, and Damodar Kunda.\n\n"},{"hash":"ce463058b33549dd71ea5db5d795dcfb86291d761800576b18a1e876edc8729f","title":"qatar-airways-starts-commercial-flights-from-gautam-buddha-airport","date":1731369600000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/travel-and-tourism/qatar-airways-starts-commercial-flights-from-gautam-buddha-airport","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/qatar1731410130_1024.jpg","category":"travel-and-tourism","content":"\n    KATHMANDU:  Qatar Airways has started operating flights from Gautam Buddha International Airport (GBIA) from today.An Airbus 330 plane that arrived from Doha landed at the Gautam Buddha International Airport this afternoon, according to GBIA Office.  \nGeneral Manager of Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), Pratap Babu Tiwari said that Qatar Airways has started its commercial flights from Airbus 330 at Gautam Buddha Airport for the first time. \nQatar Airways will now operate regular one flight on the Doha-Bhairahawa-Kathmandu-Doha route.\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has got permission to operate flight to and from GBIA until November 30.  \nWith this, the number of airlines companies operating flights from FBIA has reached five.

Internal Affairs and Law Minister Rewati Raman Bhandari and Minister for Physical Infrastructure Development Bhupendra Rai are its members while the secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law serves as its member-secretary.A provincial assembly meeting had named Province 1 as Koshi on March 1 last year. The name, proposed by the CPN-UML, was endorsed by an overwhelming majority, with assembly members from the Nepali Congress, the CPN (Maoist Centre), and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) voting in its favour.But the nomenclature did not sit well with various ethnic groups that had been demanding the province be named after the ethnic identity of the dominant communities residing in the province. The groups then took to the streets against the nomenclature.Amid this, on December 8, members of the struggle committee tried to show a black flag, as a symbolic protest, to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli while he was visiting his home district of Jhapa.Minister for Internal Affairs and Law Bhandari said that there are various issues related to community, identity and ethnicity that have emerged in the province and may arise in the future as well. “The dialogue committee will find solutions to these issues through negotiations in line with the constitution and laws,” he said.The dialogue team has yet to start its work. As Sunday is a public holiday, the committee is likely to hold a formal meeting with the agitating groups on Monday, Bhandari said.“We can talk jointly or separately with different groups—it will be determined by the terms of reference (ToR) that our committee formulates,” Minister Bhandari added. “At present, at least eight to nine groups are protesting by taking up identity issues.”The agitating groups have also been demanding that Maithili be designated the official language of the province, Minister Bhandari said.But Govinda Chhantyal, an identity-based rights activist, differs with the minister. “The identity movement has been raising the issue of language long before the issue of naming the Koshi emerged,” he said.“While the government recognised 12 official languages, Limbu and Maithili were recognised as the official languages ​​of Koshi Province,” Chhantyal added. “We have since then been linking the language issue with the identity movement.”In 2021, the language commission submitted its report to then President Bidya Devi Bhandari and then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, recommending 12 languages, including Nepali, as official languages.Koshi Provincial Assembly member from Nepali Congress Shamsher Rai emphasises the importance of resolving outstanding issues through dialogue. The previous government held talks with the agitating groups twice. Although the talks had progressed positively, the change of government at the centre and the province later affected them, Rai said.“Both sides should opt for dialogue,” Rai said.Prem Yakten, coordinator of the struggle committee accused the current provincial government of ignoring the problem.“If the government ignores our movement, we will intensify it in other provinces too,” coordinator Yatken said. “The main agenda of our protest is to rename the Koshi Province.”Soon after the provincial assembly named the province as Koshi, the agitating groups started disruptive activities. Authorities had to announce prohibitory orders in the province for a few days.Upon reaching an agreement on February 9 with the Kedar Karki-led government, the agitating groups had halted their protests. They later contested in the subsequent by-election held in Ilam-2.In the April by-election held to elect a federal lawmaker from Ilam-2, two activists of the Province-1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee—Dakendra Limbu and Milan Limbu—contested the seats. Dakendra fought as an independent candidate while Milan contested as a candidate from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). Dakendra secured third position with 11,457 votes; CPN-UML’s Suhang Nemwang, the son of former Speaker late Subas Nembang, won the election.“The by-election held earlier this year boosted our confidence and the election result justified our movement,” Yakten said.“We had reached a five-point agreement with the Kedar Karki-led government,” Yakten said. “The government’s dialogue committee had then agreed to take political initiatives to resolve the issue of renaming the Koshi Province.” According to him, the provincial government had agreed to fund the treatment of those injured during the agitation and compensate the families of those who died in it.“The government committee had vowed to start the process of releasing those in prison and withdrawing cases of those charged of vandalism,” Yakten said. “But none of the agreements were implemented, compelling us to hit the street again.”Yakten says that they have come up with an alternative name for the province.“Earlier, supporters of identity-based nomenclature had suggested alternate names for the Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province as well but they were ignored,” Yakten added. “Even now, they accuse us of not having an alternative name. We have it but we won’t make it public until the government is ready to change the name.” "},{"hash":"8d55f5de3f1e2069c9dc026660a6a826fa45e9fc076b2c0c5e3e0c7c67a77cae","title":"government-under-pressure-from-opposition-to-call-winter-session-of-parliament","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/15/government-under-pressure-from-opposition-to-call-winter-session-of-parliament","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/Parliament-1734226029.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1734220800000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"Preparations are on to call the winter session of the federal parliament from the first week of January, amid the opposition's claims that the government wants to push back the session.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Speaker Devraj Ghimire, and Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Ajay Chaurasiya held informal discussions on Friday to take stock of the bills that may be presented before lawmakers.

Officials say the process has been stuck between the industry and law ministries.Baburam Adhikari, joint-secretary at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, said the law ministry was conducting an organisation and management (O&M) survey. This process of evaluating and analysing the set-up for institutionalising the court may take months.Once the survey is concluded and the appointment process completed, the industry ministry will transfer the budget for its daily operation.“I have heard that the law ministry is proceeding with the O&M survey,” said Adhikari. “I also heard that the Department of Drug Administration premises at Babarmahal will be provided for the court’s operation,” Adhikari added without confirming.However, the law ministry has a different answer.“We wrote to the industry ministry two weeks ago seeking the name of a consumer court member with extensive knowledge of the consumer market,\" said Komal Bahadur Khatri, spokesperson for the law ministry. “We also requested details on physical infrastructure preparedness and the deadline for the court’s operation.”Khatri said they have yet to begin the O&M survey. “When the industry ministry replies to our queries, the law ministry will send a proposal to the Cabinet seeking its approval in principle to begin the court’s operation,” he added.Adhikari had no information about the law ministry’s letter but said: “Hopefully, we expect the consumer court to operate by mid-July.”In October, the Judicial Council recommended Judge Ram Prasad Sharma of Kathmandu District Court to chair the consumer court, and under-secretary Gehendra Raj Regmi was nominated as a member.Earlier, it was said that a consumer court would be established at the Department of Drug Administration as a temporary arrangement in the property belonging to the industry ministry.However, the Supreme Court has ordered the setting up of separate infrastructure.A consumer court was supposed to begin hearing cases from Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur.However, the respective district courts have the mandate to handle consumer complaints until the specific courts are established in other provinces.The industry ministry said a consumer court has been established only inside the Kathmandu Valley due to budget constraints. The Supreme Court, however, has ordered consumer courts be established outside the Valley as well.Consumer courts are said to ensure fast, faceless, paperless, and proper compensation for the victims in consumer cases.“Once the consumer court comes into operation, the consumer with the bill of goods and services can file a case in the dedicated court,” Jyoti Baniya, chairperson of the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal, told the Post in a recent interview. “The consumer will not have to wait for a hearing date as the process will move swiftly.”He said a similar case might take 2–3 years or more in regular courts.Consumer issues have been growing, especially after Nepal adopted digitisation, particularly in e-commerce. The Consumer Protection Act 2018 requires the government to establish a consumer court.Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a legislation draft to the law ministry in September 2019, which then forwarded it to the Judicial Council.As the process was delayed, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers’ interests amid repeated cases of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court.Industry ministry officials, however, said setting up a consumer court in a province would be impractical, as people would still have to travel long distances to present their cases.After piloting in Kathmandu, the ministry will work to establish consumer courts in each district.The process, however, has been delayed due to frequent government changes.Last fiscal year’s budget announced the formation of a consumer court in Kathmandu on a trial basis and allocated Rs10 million.A consumer court primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding consumer courts to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.The presence of consumer courts is expected to have a big impact on controlling food adulteration, artificial shortages, and price manipulation. Consumers are facing difficulties accessing water, energy, telecoms, and financial services even after paying for them.Besides, as Nepal’s e-commerce sector grows, consumer fraud has become more prevalent.

This process of evaluating and analysing the set-up for institutionalising the court may take months.Once the survey is concluded and the appointment process completed, the industry ministry will transfer the budget for its daily operation.“I have heard that the law ministry is proceeding with the O&M survey,” said Adhikari. “I also heard that the Department of Drug Administration premises at Babarmahal will be provided for the court’s operation,” Adhikari added without confirming.However, the law ministry has a different answer.“We wrote to the industry ministry two weeks ago seeking the name of a consumer court member with extensive knowledge of the consumer market,\" said Komal Bahadur Khatri, spokesperson for the law ministry. “We also requested details on physical infrastructure preparedness and the deadline for the court’s operation.”Khatri said they have yet to begin the O&M survey. “When the industry ministry replies to our queries, the law ministry will send a proposal to the Cabinet seeking its approval in principle to begin the court’s operation,” he added.Adhikari had no information about the law ministry’s letter but said: “Hopefully, we expect the consumer court to operate by mid-July.”In October, the Judicial Council recommended Judge Ram Prasad Sharma of Kathmandu District Court to chair the consumer court, and under-secretary Gehendra Raj Regmi was nominated as a member.Earlier, it was said that a consumer court would be established at the Department of Drug Administration as a temporary arrangement in the property belonging to the industry ministry.However, the Supreme Court has ordered the setting up of separate infrastructure.A consumer court was supposed to begin hearing cases from Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur.However, the respective district courts have the mandate to handle consumer complaints until the specific courts are established in other provinces.The industry ministry said a consumer court has been established only inside the Kathmandu Valley due to budget constraints. The Supreme Court, however, has ordered consumer courts be established outside the Valley as well.Consumer courts are said to ensure fast, faceless, paperless, and proper compensation for the victims in consumer cases.“Once the consumer court comes into operation, the consumer with the bill of goods and services can file a case in the dedicated court,” Jyoti Baniya, chairperson of the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal, told the Post in a recent interview. “The consumer will not have to wait for a hearing date as the process will move swiftly.”He said a similar case might take 2–3 years or more in regular courts.Consumer issues have been growing, especially after Nepal adopted digitisation, particularly in e-commerce. The Consumer Protection Act 2018 requires the government to establish a consumer court.Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a legislation draft to the law ministry in September 2019, which then forwarded it to the Judicial Council.As the process was delayed, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers’ interests amid repeated cases of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court.Industry ministry officials, however, said setting up a consumer court in a province would be impractical, as people would still have to travel long distances to present their cases.After piloting in Kathmandu, the ministry will work to establish consumer courts in each district.The process, however, has been delayed due to frequent government changes.Last fiscal year’s budget announced the formation of a consumer court in Kathmandu on a trial basis and allocated Rs10 million.A consumer court primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding consumer courts to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.The presence of consumer courts is expected to have a big impact on controlling food adulteration, artificial shortages, and price manipulation. Consumers are facing difficulties accessing water, energy, telecoms, and financial services even after paying for them.Besides, as Nepal’s e-commerce sector grows, consumer fraud has become more prevalent.

Consequently, Himalayan Studies in Nepal have also been imagined as beginning with the scholarly engagement of Western social scientists alone. Given the historical condition of Nepal’s ‘non-coloniality’, to use Mary Des Chene, it might seem premature to raise the clarion call for decolonising Himalayan Studies in Nepal. But will it not be too surprising to uncritically accept that in relation to Himalaya there had been a complete void of scholarship ‘from within’ Nepal?Perspective ‘from within’Since the 1950s, works on the Himalaya emerging from within Nepal, where scholars raised pertinent questions, sketched out perspectives and provided analytical insights without provincialising the conceptual paradigms of their videshi colleagues, was not uncommon. Such contributions may appear valuable when pitched as ‘perspectives from within’—which can offer Himalayan Studies scholarship a distinctive Nepali flavour. An engagement with works like Iman Singh Chemjong’s History and Culture of Kirat People (1948), Janak Lal Sharma’s Hamro Samaj: Ek Adhyayan (VS 2039), or numerous personal memoirs written in the context of Tibet like Mahasthavir Dharmaloka’s Mahachin Yatra (1950), Chittadhar Hridaya's Mimmanah Pau (1968), Nhuchhe Bahadur Bajrachaya’s The Story of My Life (1998) and such earlier attempts might endow Himalayan Studies scholarship in Nepal with a Nepali anchorage. Pondering the existing scholarship on Himalaya, one is likely to come across works from Nepali social scientists. These works hint at autonomous thinking, reflect upon the agentiality of researchers while doing Himalayan Studies, and pose serious methodological or conceptual questions while studying the Himalaya. However, these contributions have received less critical attention. Dor Bahadur BistaThe illustrious Nepali anthropologist and close aide of Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf, Dor Bahadur Bista, successfully attempted to Nepalize not only disciplinary imagination but also disciplinary practices for research and teaching anthropology in Nepal. Bista is famous for his People of Nepal (1967), published by the Department of Publicity, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and His Majesty’s Government, Nepal. Section three of the book features the highland people of Nepal, introducing “Nepal’s northern border with Tibet as high Himalayan country”.Ethnographic accounts on 10 Himalayan communities are included, where borderland characteristics of the region are foregrounded, presumably for the first time by a Nepali anthropologist. In one of his best but least discussed articles titled, ‘The Political Innovators of Upper Kali Gandaki’, published in Man in 1971, Bista provides a glimpse of what may be understood as highland political culture. He describes how the Thakalis of upper Kali-Gandaki successfully secured political power and authority within their group and restructured their tribal hierarchy with other groups of the region which was, however, transformed over the years. This article is a robust critique of James Scott’s Zomianist thinking, which considered South East Asian and Himalayan highlands as state-evading zones that should garner no attention while discussing political structure or system. Chaitanya Mishra Much like Bista, Mishra did not write extensively on the Himalaya. However, in ‘Mountain Development: A Brief Theoretical Note’ (1988), he sketched a plausible design for the study of the relationship between ecosystem and development. Mishra argued that the large-scale changes in the Himalayan Mountain region are attributable partly to geomorphological forces, but mainly to human social activities continuing through the last 150 years. He pointed out that faster rates of change may be considered as the effect of the organisation of the capitalist production process. More than three decades ago, Mishra hinted at the combined force of the Anthropocene and Capitalocene in bringing about changes in the mountain while also illustrating the causes of the mountain’s marginalisation through the interaction between human beings, state apparatus and the Himalaya.Prayag Raj SharmaPrayag Raj Sharma’s ‘Emergence of a hill-town: Urban development in Nepal’s rural backhills’ (1994) showed the possibility and necessity of rethinking urban development in the context of Nepal highlands. Of the total number of hill towns in Nepal, a significant majority originated in the aftermath of Gorkha political unification and not as an outgrowth of any urbanising tendencies within the local peasantry. Nevertheless, those who helped establish it in the 19th century intended it to work as a servicing centre, in the building of which they necessarily incorporated some degree of planning. Such a place became known as a bajār, which means market or market place. Sharma’s intervention raises serious concerns regarding our uncritical compliance with concepts and processes generally used in social science research. However, no one considered these important while pursuing larger debates in Nepali academia, despite knowing that much of our social science concepts and categories are embedded within the valley-centric ontology. ConclusionAn intimate chapter of agentiality in Nepali scholarship vis-à-vis Himalayan Studies emerged in the 1930s. It associates Itihas Shiromani Baburam Acharya and the need for a Nepali term of reference for Mount Everest. After noticing that the world’s highest peak, though located in Nepal, had no Nepali term in the first-ever scientific map of Nepal published by the Survey of India in 1932 and was identified as Jhyāmolongmā, its Tibetan derivation in 1934, Acharya wrote an exploratory essay Sagarmatha ya Jhyāmolongmā published in Sharda in 1939. Realising that the presence of the Tibetan term might confuse the Nepalis, Acharya used the Nepali term Sagarmatha for Mt Everest. Although the contemporary Rana rulers did not find the absence of a Nepali term on the map objectionable, they charged Acharya with attempts to insult the British by giving a Nepali name to the peak, already named after ‘our friends’. He was immediately sacked from his job as an accountant in the Education Department.Surprisingly, although the peak was only about 100 miles away from Kantipur, people were to identify its greatness only through the English term. Had Baburam Acharya shown complacency to the British, the necessity to use Sagarmatha to refer to the world’s highest peak would not have emerged in the late 1930s. Though the darwar accepted the term Sagarmatha in 1961, Mt Everest’s Nepali belongingness can solely be attributed to Acharya, who was not simply translating the English term. Sagarmatha embodies Nepali popular imagination and situates the peak within the lived traditions of Kirati people and the nationalist texture of the Nepali nation while epitomising the rootedness of Acharya’s scholarship—becoming a view ‘from within’ that is both agential and decolonial. Provisioning Acharya’s vision in academics could have motivated Nepalizing Himalayan Studies in Nepal. Thus, Himalaya ‘from within’ might appear far more promising when articulated as a perspective that refers to culturally appropriated spatial imagination.This article is an abridged version of a presentation delivered at Martin Chautari Annual Conference (27-29 November, 2024).

Such contributions may appear valuable when pitched as ‘perspectives from within’—which can offer Himalayan Studies scholarship a distinctive Nepali flavour. An engagement with works like Iman Singh Chemjong’s History and Culture of Kirat People (1948), Janak Lal Sharma’s Hamro Samaj: Ek Adhyayan (VS 2039), or numerous personal memoirs written in the context of Tibet like Mahasthavir Dharmaloka’s Mahachin Yatra (1950), Chittadhar Hridaya's Mimmanah Pau (1968), Nhuchhe Bahadur Bajrachaya’s The Story of My Life (1998) and such earlier attempts might endow Himalayan Studies scholarship in Nepal with a Nepali anchorage. Pondering the existing scholarship on Himalaya, one is likely to come across works from Nepali social scientists. These works hint at autonomous thinking, reflect upon the agentiality of researchers while doing Himalayan Studies, and pose serious methodological or conceptual questions while studying the Himalaya. However, these contributions have received less critical attention. Dor Bahadur BistaThe illustrious Nepali anthropologist and close aide of Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf, Dor Bahadur Bista, successfully attempted to Nepalize not only disciplinary imagination but also disciplinary practices for research and teaching anthropology in Nepal. Bista is famous for his People of Nepal (1967), published by the Department of Publicity, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and His Majesty’s Government, Nepal. Section three of the book features the highland people of Nepal, introducing “Nepal’s northern border with Tibet as high Himalayan country”.Ethnographic accounts on 10 Himalayan communities are included, where borderland characteristics of the region are foregrounded, presumably for the first time by a Nepali anthropologist. In one of his best but least discussed articles titled, ‘The Political Innovators of Upper Kali Gandaki’, published in Man in 1971, Bista provides a glimpse of what may be understood as highland political culture. He describes how the Thakalis of upper Kali-Gandaki successfully secured political power and authority within their group and restructured their tribal hierarchy with other groups of the region which was, however, transformed over the years. This article is a robust critique of James Scott’s Zomianist thinking, which considered South East Asian and Himalayan highlands as state-evading zones that should garner no attention while discussing political structure or system. Chaitanya Mishra Much like Bista, Mishra did not write extensively on the Himalaya. However, in ‘Mountain Development: A Brief Theoretical Note’ (1988), he sketched a plausible design for the study of the relationship between ecosystem and development. Mishra argued that the large-scale changes in the Himalayan Mountain region are attributable partly to geomorphological forces, but mainly to human social activities continuing through the last 150 years. He pointed out that faster rates of change may be considered as the effect of the organisation of the capitalist production process. More than three decades ago, Mishra hinted at the combined force of the Anthropocene and Capitalocene in bringing about changes in the mountain while also illustrating the causes of the mountain’s marginalisation through the interaction between human beings, state apparatus and the Himalaya.Prayag Raj SharmaPrayag Raj Sharma’s ‘Emergence of a hill-town: Urban development in Nepal’s rural backhills’ (1994) showed the possibility and necessity of rethinking urban development in the context of Nepal highlands. Of the total number of hill towns in Nepal, a significant majority originated in the aftermath of Gorkha political unification and not as an outgrowth of any urbanising tendencies within the local peasantry. Nevertheless, those who helped establish it in the 19th century intended it to work as a servicing centre, in the building of which they necessarily incorporated some degree of planning. Such a place became known as a bajār, which means market or market place. Sharma’s intervention raises serious concerns regarding our uncritical compliance with concepts and processes generally used in social science research. However, no one considered these important while pursuing larger debates in Nepali academia, despite knowing that much of our social science concepts and categories are embedded within the valley-centric ontology. ConclusionAn intimate chapter of agentiality in Nepali scholarship vis-à-vis Himalayan Studies emerged in the 1930s. It associates Itihas Shiromani Baburam Acharya and the need for a Nepali term of reference for Mount Everest. After noticing that the world’s highest peak, though located in Nepal, had no Nepali term in the first-ever scientific map of Nepal published by the Survey of India in 1932 and was identified as Jhyāmolongmā, its Tibetan derivation in 1934, Acharya wrote an exploratory essay Sagarmatha ya Jhyāmolongmā published in Sharda in 1939. Realising that the presence of the Tibetan term might confuse the Nepalis, Acharya used the Nepali term Sagarmatha for Mt Everest. Although the contemporary Rana rulers did not find the absence of a Nepali term on the map objectionable, they charged Acharya with attempts to insult the British by giving a Nepali name to the peak, already named after ‘our friends’. He was immediately sacked from his job as an accountant in the Education Department.Surprisingly, although the peak was only about 100 miles away from Kantipur, people were to identify its greatness only through the English term. Had Baburam Acharya shown complacency to the British, the necessity to use Sagarmatha to refer to the world’s highest peak would not have emerged in the late 1930s. Though the darwar accepted the term Sagarmatha in 1961, Mt Everest’s Nepali belongingness can solely be attributed to Acharya, who was not simply translating the English term. Sagarmatha embodies Nepali popular imagination and situates the peak within the lived traditions of Kirati people and the nationalist texture of the Nepali nation while epitomising the rootedness of Acharya’s scholarship—becoming a view ‘from within’ that is both agential and decolonial. Provisioning Acharya’s vision in academics could have motivated Nepalizing Himalayan Studies in Nepal. Thus, Himalaya ‘from within’ might appear far more promising when articulated as a perspective that refers to culturally appropriated spatial imagination.This article is an abridged version of a presentation delivered at Martin Chautari Annual Conference (27-29 November, 2024).

Such actions show that we as a country are nowhere close to prioritising green energy. On paper, Nepal plans to produce more than 28,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 as part of its green, renewable energy ambition. But, in practice, it is desperately lobbying for a multi-million dollar cross-border LPG pipeline project with India, supporting a continued reliance on imported fossil fuels. What our policymakers seem to be ignoring are the risks fossil fuels pose to the environment and the setbacks they cause to the overall development of hydropower in the country. Evidently, reducing the reliance on LPGs would save the country more than Rs50 billion—which was spent on importing cooking gas in the last fiscal year—which in turn would also make a big dent in the country’s ever-rising trade deficit. Moreover, compared to the LPG, electricity-powered stoves are more sustainable, environmentally friendly and cost-effective. But rather than cut their supply and imports in the country, policymakers are looking for ways to make them easily and widely available. The pouring of billions into the gas project will make the path for the establishment of additional hydropower projects in the country more difficult. Despite having the potential to produce 40,000 megawatts, the country currently generates just around 3,000 megawatts. So experts warn that the hydropower potential is at risk of being undermined by the government’s investment in fossil fuel infrastructure. At present, 44.3 percent of households in the country rely on LPG for cooking, and only 0.5 percent use electricity for the purpose, despite a surplus of hydroelectricity even during off-peak seasons. The government will require $25 billion to meet its target of replacing 25 percent of LPGs with electric stoves by 2030. Nepal is also looking to install 500,000 improved cooking stoves with a focus on rural areas. These green goals, unfortunately, are bound to get sidelined due to the LPG pipeline project. It is not that the electric cooking vision doesn’t have challenges. There are issues of frequent power cuts and low voltages. Similarly, even though Nepal’s national grid has expanded to almost 95 percent of the country’s households, five percent are still left in the lurch. This again highlights the need to ensure uninterrupted electricity for all. It is high time the government gave up the temptation of short-term LPG gains and aligned its strategies with the vision of making electric stoves one of the primary cooking methods by 2030.

The country’s energy security and environment are not the things that the government can take lightly.  "},{"hash":"38300aed7b957b1ad5a67de55269cc56639c7058538b118b8e6138b9083bbeb9","title":"south-korea-s-acting-president-moves-to-reassure-allies-calm-markets-after-impeachment","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/12/15/south-korea-s-acting-president-moves-to-reassure-allies-calm-markets-after-impeachment","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/KAYKITN34RKXXFHMT5JYVO4NIY-1734240229.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1734220800000,"source":"kp","category":"world","content":"South Korea’s acting president, Han Duck-soo, moved on Sunday to reassure the country’s allies and calm financial markets a day after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and suspended from his duties over a martial law attempt.Han spoke with US President Joe Biden by phone, the White House and Han’s office said.“South Korea will carry out its foreign and security policies without disruption and strive to ensure the South Korea-US alliance is maintained and developed steadfastly,” Han said, according to a statement from his office.In a further attempt to stabilise the country’s leadership, the main opposition party announced it would not seek to impeach Han for his involvement in Yoon’s Dec. 3 martial law decision.“Given that the prime minister has already been confirmed as acting president and considering that excessive impeachments could lead to confusion in national governance, we have decided not to proceed with impeachment procedures,” Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung told reporters.Han, a longtime technocrat picked by Yoon as prime minister, was elevated to acting president in accordance with the constitution while Yoon’s case moves to the Constitutional Court.NORTH KOREAN THREATYoon’s surprise martial law declaration and the ensuing political crisis spooked markets and South Korea’s diplomatic partners worried over the country’s ability to deter nuclear-armed North Korea.Biden told Han the ironclad US-South Korea alliance remained unchanged and Washington would work with Seoul to further develop and strengthen the alliance as well as trilateral cooperation including neighbour Japan, Han’s office said.The White House said in a statement that the US president “expressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy and the rule of law in the ROK and reaffirmed the ironclad commitment of the United States to the people of the ROK,” using the abbreviation for the country’s formal name, the Republic of Korea.“President Biden expressed his confidence that the Alliance will remain the linchpin for peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region during Acting President Han’s tenure.”Han convened his cabinet and National Security Council shortly after Saturday’s impeachment vote and vowed to maintain military readiness to prevent any breach of national security.South Korea’s partners wanted to see a credible and constitutional temporary leadership put in place as soon as possible, said Philip Turner, a former New Zealand ambassador to South Korea.“They will be pleased to see Prime Minister Han take over as acting president,” he said. “He is capable, experienced and well respected in foreign capitals.”But even with an acting president in place, international partners face months of uncertainty before a new president can be elected and a new government established, Turner added.The Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether to remove or reinstate Yoon.

Previously, people from Upper Mustang had to carry vegetables from lowland areas. Aside from potatoes, no vegetables grew in the region.However, increasing temperatures, declining snowfall, and erratic rainfall have enabled vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, and zucchinis to grow even in barren Himalayan landscapes. These changes are altering traditional farming practices and kitchens in Mustang.“I remember travelling to the lowlands with my family and horses to transport vegetables like tomatoes and cauliflower,” said Chhirring Dolma Gurung of Ghami, ward 4 of Lo-Ghekar Damodarkunda Rural Municipality. “Now we grow these vegetables in our own fields. Visitors to Upper Mustang enjoy meals prepared with locally grown produce.”Gurung said that while vegetable farming is currently limited to household needs, the community plans to export organic produce to markets in the lowlands in the coming years.Experts attribute this shift to increasing rainfall and rising temperatures. “Rainfall enriches dry soil, and higher temperatures facilitate growth,” said Rajesh Gurung, head of the Agriculture Knowledge Centre in Mustang. “This phenomenon, known as ‘crop shifting,’ is evident in vegetables and other crops in Mustang.”Data from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology support these observations. Rainfall in the region has increased significantly. In Chhoser, ward 1 of Lo Manthang, rainfall levels rose from below 200mm per year in 2009 to 331mm by 2023. Similarly, rainfall in Jomsom increased from less than 300mm in 2010 to 665mm in 2023. Experts say even minor changes in temperature or precipitation can have substantial effects on the environment.The United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Report 2007/8 had predicted that climate change would bring new vegetables and lowland vegetation to Himalayan regions like Mustang and Manang. The report foresaw increased greenery and shifts in local ecosystems. This prediction has become a reality in Lo Manthang, where greenhouse farming has gained traction. Warmer temperatures have spurred a shift towards climate-resilient vegetable farming, disrupting traditional practices. Vegetables like cauliflower, tomatoes, and zucchini now thrive on previously barren land, covered in snow for much of the year.“Motorable roads have brought cultural, agricultural, and educational advancements to Upper Mustang,” Lo Manthang Rural Municipality Chairperson Tashi Nurbu Gurung said. “We are encouraging locals to adapt to climate change by growing vegetables previously limited to lowland areas.

But snowfall has significantly decreased, while rainfall has increased in recent years.Chhimi Gurung, a 45-year-old resident of ward 3 of Varagung Muktichhetra Rural Municipality, cultivated cucumbers, bitter gourds, and okra for the first time in her field. “We didn’t expect these crops to grow, but the cucumbers planted in April thrived by September,” she said.Climate-induced changes have expanded crop zones in Mustang, with apples, once grown only in lower Mustang, now cultivated in Lo Manthang.

A US official said Hamas has softened its position in ceasefire talks.Blinken is touring the Middle East to establish a united front with Arab and Turkish allies on the set of principles that Washington hopes will guide Syria’s political transition, such as inclusivity and respect for minorities.He said on Monday that the Islamic State would try to use this period to re-establish capabilities in Syria, but the United States was determined not to let that happen.“Our countries worked very hard and gave a lot over many years to ensure the elimination of the territorial caliphate of ISIS, to ensure that threat doesn’t rear its head again, and it’s imperative that we keep at those efforts,” Blinken said alongside Fidan after they met in Ankara.Talks also focused on a critical aspect of establishing stability in Syria - clashes in the north of the country between the US-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Turkish-backed rebels.The SDF is the main ally in a US coalition against the Islamic State militants. It is spearheaded by YPG militia, a group that Ankara sees as an extension of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants that it outlaws and who have fought the Turkish state for 40 years.NATO allies Washington and Ankara supported Syrian rebels during the 13-year civil war, but their interests clashed when it came to the SDF faction.Turkish leaders agreed with Blinken that the SDF should not be distracted from its role of securing camps holding detained Islamic State fighters, and from fighting the remnants of that group, said the US official, who was speaking on the condition of anonymity and has knowledge of Blinken's meetings with Turkish leaders.Earlier this week, Turkish-backed forces seized the northern city of Manbij from the SDF, which then headed east of the Euphrates River. A Syrian opposition source told Reuters the US and Turkey had reached an agreement on the withdrawal.Neither Blinken nor Fidan made any reference to the agreement, but the US official travelling with Blinken said it was a focus of the talks.The official said the ceasefire had generally held, but settling the broader tensions between Kurds in Syria and Turkey would take more time, adding that Washington was closely watching any moves by Turkey or Turkish-backed forces on the Kurdish-controlled town of Kobani.After meeting with Blinken, Fidan said Turkey’s “priority in Syria is to ensure stability...as soon as possible, to prevent terrorism from gaining ground and to prevent Islamic State and the PKK from dominating there.”“We discussed in detail what we can do about these, what our common concerns are, and what our common solutions should be,” he said.In an interview with Turkish-broadcaster NTV late on Friday, Fidan said the elimination of YPG was Turkey’s “strategic target” and urged the group's commanders to leave Syria.He also criticized the West, saying it was using the PKK to secure the detention camps holding Islamic State fighters and that the PKK was \"blackmailing\" the international community through this role.Gaza CeasefireBlinken also pressed the importance of a ceasefire to end hostilities between Palestinian militants Hamas and Israel in Gaza during his meetings in Turkey, as Washington makes a fresh push to clinch a deal that has eluded President Joe Biden's administration for over a year.“In my discussions with President Erdogan and with Minister Fidan we talked about the imperative of Hamas saying yes to the (Gaza) agreement that’s possible to finally help bring this to an end,” Blinken said following his meeting with Fidan.“We appreciate very much the role that Turkey can play in using its voice with Hamas, to try to bring this to a conclusion.”Hamas has softened its position in ceasefire talks and Turkey has begun employing its leverage over the group since many Hamas leaders moved to Istanbul from Doha, the US official said.

The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said.

The charges were based on allegations that Sharma was part of a conspiracy to bribe Nepali officials to secure two Airbus A330 deals in 2017.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.

He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.

Yet, we are trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high migration. When the Constitution was finally promulgated two decades after the launch of the Maoist People’s War, we expected politics to be our salvation. Unfortunately, it has become our prison.Nepal's low-growth, high-migration trap isn't just an economic phenomenon—it's a political protection mechanism that preserves an unsustainable kleptocracy and crony capitalism. While the World Bank calls for a “systematic assault” on economic barriers, what Nepal needs is a paradigm shift that will fundamentally transform power relations and dismantle extractive networks.Without such a shift, emerging political agency and a growing structural crisis will create a rupture. The absence of comprehensive political and economic reforms is a matter of serious concern for Nepalis. It does not just affect our graduation to a middle-income status, which has already been pushed behind schedule; it also impacts the lives of millions of people and determines Nepal’s development trajectory.The trapSince the World Bank's initial analysis in 2017, Nepal's “low-growth, high-migration trap” has deepened. According to the World Bank, low-growth fails to generate employment. As a result, a large number of youth are forced to migrate. Migration brings in remittance, enabling consumption but no productive investment. High remittance not only creates economic distortions, but also reduces pressure on the top leaders to deliver reforms. The lack of reforms, in turn, reinforces low growth.Despite poverty reduction, Nepal has been growing at only about 4 percent, marginally better than the 2 percent growth achieved in 2023. At this rate, Nepal will be unable to graduate from LDC at least until 2030.Nepal’s economic trends and fiscal positions are becoming increasingly unsustainable, creating pressures for change. For example, budget execution rates are below 80 percent, revenue collection is dwindling, capital expenditure is low, and the debt service burden is rising.While the per capita income remains at around $1,400, limiting job creation, the manufacturing sector’s GDP share has shrunk by half since 2008. While migration is increasing, fiscal indicators are worsening. Our dependence on migration is growing. While public debt is about 44 percent of the GDP, our revenues are shrinking. Debt servicing and financial management consume almost 20 percent of the budget, while development expenditure has shrunk to 19 percent and is poorly executed.Political agencyThe kleptocracy, patronised by top political leaders, extracts power and money from the people and the state. In doing so, they misuse state power, distort its bodies and hollow out legal institutions. Despite this, political agency has failed to drive change.Institutions like the World Bank have been advocating comprehensive reforms. For example, they want to break policy barriers, build new growth sources, revitalise agriculture, address migration issues and unleash financial reforms. These reforms would make the economy more competitive, productive and broad-based. All of these recommendations directly impact the existing extractive system dominated by crony capitalism, kleptocracy and political parties. Initiating changes would mean changing the status quo, which is why these suggestions fail.The failure of new parties to put pressure on traditional parties has not helped. When the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) emerged just before the 2022 elections, it was largely driven by the aspirations of migrant workers. However, the ethical dilemma posed by evidence of corruption of RSP’s founder has dented the party’s aspirations. When the current coalition was forged, one of the objectives was to deliver results to the people to show them that there was no need for new parties. This strategy has failed. However, the new parties have met the same fate, ultimately benefiting the entrenched leaders. One of the results of this mismatch between people’s expectations and political delivery is the reluctance of people to identify themselves with a political party. Rather, the disenchantment and dissatisfaction echo in social media in fragmented ways. Activism has not worked because people have become distrustful of not only political parties but also activists who claim to represent civil society.Incremental reforms?There are enough people who believe that incremental reforms in the economy will add up and drive change. Some people are also hopeful that the traditional parties are feeling the pressure and will reform, albeit slowly. Then there are others who think we must seek alternatives to the current political system. Many of them tout China as a model of growth and aspire to have “political stability.”None of these approaches will work, unfortunately.Traditional solutions offered by donors and development partners often fail because they cannot address political-economy factors and political dynamics. These solutions focus on the symptoms rather than the root causes. Incremental reforms are often absorbed by the system, with all its deformities. And when the reforms are significant, the kleptocracy swiftly neutralises the attempts.For a few years, the traditional political parties could create the illusion of change, but all that the superficial democracy did was maintain the status quo. The current political system is rooted in extractive kleptocracy because the parties need each other to survive. Reforms will undermine the sources of political power and wealth. Therefore, political reform is impossible without disrupting the existing political power models.The current political malaise has discredited the whole democratic system. Seeking an alternative to the democratic system, however, is not an option. According to renowned economists, democracies perform at least 20 percent better than non-democracies in delivering prosperity. Democracies can also deliver more investment, economic reforms and public goods.A likely ruptureYes, the emergence of new political forces has faltered. Yet, this is only a temporary blip. At least four quarters are pressing for transformation in our political and economic system: the migrant population, urban youth, a traditionalist nationalist force allied with the former monarchy and a liberal-minded civil society. Even if political agency and social movements have failed to produce well-thought-out political movements, structural factors will continue to push for change because the status quo is untenable, and it is little prepared for shocks that may come from unexpected quarters.New structural pressures are building: Demographic transition creates new demands, digital transformation rearranges political psychology and regional economic integration forces competitiveness. Demographic pressures, economic vulnerabilities, migration impacts and urbanisation pressures will continue to generate strain until the status quo breaks.Our hope is that political agency and the structural crisis will align so that we are able to manage the transformation in a meaningful way. Otherwise, instability and chaos will become unavoidable. ","summary":"Nepal has almost everything it needs for prosperity: A strategic location, tourism potential, hydropower and a young population.

It is about the complicated lives of two brothers as they grieve the loss of their father from cancer. The story is based in Dublin and revolves around 32-year-old Peter Koubek and 22-year-old Ivan Koubek. Their parents live separately. The boys’ mother, Christine, lives with her boyfriend and children. Peter is a lawyer, whereas Ivan is a chess genius.These two brothers have a distant relationship, which further strains after their father’s death. Struggling to connect, they seek solace in romantic relationships. In the novel, we can see Ivan saying they were close when he was small. However, after he turns 16 and Peter breaks up with his high school girlfriend, Sylvia, he changes, and they grow apart. Ivan wishes for them to get back together as he thinks Sylvia has a good influence on him.Peter distracts himself with work, drugs, alcohol, and caring for two women: Sylvia, his high school girlfriend (now ex) and Naomi, a 23-year-old university student whom he is seeing at present. He had a great relationship with Sylvia, which took a turn after her accident and left her in chronic pain. For Peter’s sake, she broke up with him six years ago. But Peter isn’t over her. As he mourns his father, he also grieves for the life he and Sylvia could have had together, unable to give up their lost future. Sexual desire pushes Peter toward Naomi, who used to earn by selling her photos online. Their relationship is transactional and physical. The two women are aware of each other and have come to terms with it. Although Sylvia, now a professor of modern literature, and Peter are no longer together, they often share lunch and walk in familiar places. Peter, however, tries to keep his relationship with Naomi a secret. Sylvia is portrayed as Peter’s soulmate, someone he is comfortable and happy with, but their complicated relationship can’t work. On the other hand, while Peter cares for his girlfriend Naomi, he struggles to accept her publicly and feels guilt for being with her, as he is still not over Sylvia. Rooney also explores Peter’s mental turmoil, depicting his suicidal thoughts and reliance on drugs to sleep and escape from his real-life issues.Ivan, on the other hand, is shy and socially awkward. Once a chess prodigy who dominated major tournaments, he grapples with a career decline. He feels his career peaked during his teenage years, leaving him with little to look forward to. Despite holding a degree in theoretical physics, Ivan struggles financially, living in a shared apartment. He scrapes by with freelance data analysis work, which he detests, and spends his weekends participating in chess competitions and workshops.At a chess exhibition several hours outside Dublin, where Ivan impressively defeats ten opponents simultaneously, he meets Margaret, the event's programme director. Margaret, 14 years his senior and recently divorced from her alcoholic husband, captivates him. Their connection is born out of mutual loneliness, a rare moment where both feel seen. Despite their growing bond, the pair begin seeing each other secretly, as Margaret fears judgment from her family and friends regarding their significant age difference.At Sylvia's request, Peter invites Ivan to dinner, attempting to mend their strained relationship. During the meal, Peter tries to initiate conversations, but the evening turns tense when Ivan shares details about his new relationship with Margaret. Peter disapproves, questioning if Margaret is “normal” for dating someone so much younger and unemployed. His comments reveal his hypocrisy, as he is in a relationship with the much younger Naomi. Deeply offended, Ivan lashes out and storms out of the restaurant, shouting that he has hated Peter his entire life.As this is the first novel I’ve read by Rooney, I found her depiction of the complicated relationships between the characters compelling. The vulnerability and depth of emotions she portrays in the male characters were especially intriguing, leaving me curious about how relationships and male characters are explored in her other works.Rooney’s Irish references reveal her writing is deeply rooted in her country and culture. This book, however, demands a certain emotional readiness from its readers. It takes you through a journey of grief, pain, trauma, and tangled relationships, prompting deep reflections on life and personal connections. Yet, amidst this exploration of life’s darker moments, the book carries a message of resilience. It teaches us to embrace loss and pain, reminding us that life feels richest when we stop shielding ourselves from its realities. As she beautifully writes, “Everything exposed to light and air. Nothing protected, nothing left to be protected anymore.”The characters pose a question long after the final page: “What can life be made to accommodate, what can one life hold inside itself without breaking?” Rooney’s answer is both profound and hopeful—life, she suggests, is surprisingly vast. Like this novel, it can hold an incredible range of experiences—grief, joy, and everything.Rooney’s work consistently highlights that connections with friends, lovers, and even fleeting acquaintances are key to a meaningful life. We discover meaning through conversations, shared moments, and the stubborn pursuit of love. It’s not easy, and the characters often take unconventional paths to get there. But that’s what makes this story so relatable: the struggle, the search, and the eventual revelation that fulfilment, though elusive, is always worth chasing.Thus, ‘Intermezzo’ is a powerful exploration of love and loss. Although the first few chapters may feel confusing and lacking narrative flow, the book is worth reading. By the end, it’s not so much the plot that lingers in your mind but the characters’ emotional journey.IntermezzoAuthor: Sally RooneyYear: 2024Publisher: Faber & FaberPages: 454 ","summary":"‘Intermezzo’ is the fourth novel by Irish writer Sally Rooney.

It was planned during his prime ministership and Oli just formalised it through the agreement.“The framework is a cut and paste of the document finalised during my prime ministership,” Ganesh Shah, the party’s secretary, quoted Dahal as saying at the meeting. “Oli couldn’t make any breakthrough during the China visit.”No party leaders questioned Dahal’s statement.The leader of the opposition had made a similar claim while addressing the party’s mass meeting in his hometown of Chitwan on Tuesday. He had claimed that Oli had been circulating the photocopies of the agreement signed during Dahal’s China visit. Dahal last visited China in September last year. After multiple rounds of negotiations, Nepal and China on December 4 signed the 10-point framework for BRI cooperation, opening doors for Chinese funds for developing projects under the BRI. The funding modalities, however, will be negotiated for each project individually. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already made public the agreement undersigned by acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.Neither Dahal nor other party leaders, however, were critical of the agreement. There was a common opinion that the signing of the framework could open the doors for the country’s development, according to leaders present at the meeting.The standing committee meeting called to finalise the agenda for the party's central committee meet slated to kick off on Tuesday ended up postponing the meet.“The central committee meeting has been deferred till January 5, 2025 due to lack of preparation,” said the party’s spokesperson Agni Sapkota. “A standing committee meeting will be held for three days starting January 2 to finalise the agenda for the central committee meeting.”The Maoist Centre is negotiating with some parties including the one led by Netra Bikram Chand for a possible merger. Dahal believes there will be some concrete progress in the merger by January 5. “In the central committee meeting, the chairman was to give a message that the party is consolidating its strength by uniting with Chand and others,” said a leader. There is a possibility that former vice-president Nanda Bahadur Pun will be given some party role—possibly vice-chair—at the upcoming central committee meeting. Pun, who has started attending the Maoist Centre’s office-bearer meetings, however, was absent from the Friday meeting.Talking to media after the meeting, Sapkota said the outcome of the recent local level bypolls has foiled the attempts of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to lead the country towards a two-party system. The Maoist Centre had won 11 out of 42 seats where the by-elections were held. Elated by the results, Dahal is preparing to present it as an indication of his party gaining ground and erosion of people’s trust towards the Congress and the UML, during the party’s central committee meeting. “The by-election results also indicate people’s increasing dissatisfaction and anger at the Congress-UML government,” said Sapkota, while making the meeting’s decisions public.In the meeting, the party leadership also decided to intervene in the leadership selection in its wing All Nepal National Independent Student Union (Revolutionary). Concluding that the union failed to hold its general convention, the party decided to pick the leadership while also imposing an age bar for student politics. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September. However, it was suspended without electing the leadership following a dispute over the selection of convention representatives and whether or not to set an age bar for the leadership. The convention that was scheduled to kick off on December 8 was postponed by the Maoist Centre’s standing committee meeting on December 5. “The party will intervene and select a new leadership in the student wing. An age bar—possibly of 30 years—will also be enforced,” a party leader told the Post. For years, the Maoist Centre’s leadership has directly picked leaders of its student wing. A group of student leaders led by vice-chair Keshab Rawal has been opposing the party’s regular interference in the union, saying, “It (the party leadership) thinks the students are its slaves and abide by whatever decision it makes.” Rawal, who had once staged a hunger strike demanding union’s general convention, has threatened a fresh protest against the party’s decision. A section of the student leaders claim Dahal is reluctant about holding the general convention fearing that his favourite candidate may lose. ","summary":"The CPN (Maoist Centre) has concluded that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit was a failure as he could do nothing other than sign the agreement that was readied by the erstwhile government led by party chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal.Addressing the party’s standing committee meeting on Friday, Dahal said that the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation signed during Oli’s visit is nothing new. It was planned during his prime ministership and Oli just formalised it through the agreement.“The framework is a cut and paste of the document finalised during my prime ministership,” Ganesh Shah, the party’s secretary, quoted Dahal as saying at the meeting. “Oli couldn’t make any breakthrough during the China visit.”No party leaders questioned Dahal’s statement.The leader of the opposition had made a similar claim while addressing the party’s mass meeting in his hometown of Chitwan on Tuesday. He had claimed that Oli had been circulating the photocopies of the agreement signed during Dahal’s China visit. Dahal last visited China in September last year. After multiple rounds of negotiations, Nepal and China on December 4 signed the 10-point framework for BRI cooperation, opening doors for Chinese funds for developing projects under the BRI. The funding modalities, however, will be negotiated for each project individually. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already made public the agreement undersigned by acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.Neither Dahal nor other party leaders, however, were critical of the agreement. There was a common opinion that the signing of the framework could open the doors for the country’s development, according to leaders present at the meeting.The standing committee meeting called to finalise the agenda for the party's central committee meet slated to kick off on Tuesday ended up postponing the meet.“The central committee meeting has been deferred till January 5, 2025 due to lack of preparation,” said the party’s spokesperson Agni Sapkota. “A standing committee meeting will be held for three days starting January 2 to finalise the agenda for the central committee meeting.”The Maoist Centre is negotiating with some parties including the one led by Netra Bikram Chand for a possible merger. Dahal believes there will be some concrete progress in the merger by January 5. “In the central committee meeting, the chairman was to give a message that the party is consolidating its strength by uniting with Chand and others,” said a leader. There is a possibility that former vice-president Nanda Bahadur Pun will be given some party role—possibly vice-chair—at the upcoming central committee meeting. Pun, who has started attending the Maoist Centre’s office-bearer meetings, however, was absent from the Friday meeting.Talking to media after the meeting, Sapkota said the outcome of the recent local level bypolls has foiled the attempts of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to lead the country towards a two-party system.

However, the party leadership has failed to assign the responsibilities of departments, district in-charges, and various party bodies.Party leaders claimed that they agreed to defer the agenda for Friday citing that the party needed further discussion on the subject.“The party has almost completed the task of the work division, but we still need a little more time for the discussion,” Jagannath Khatiwada, a party leader, told the Post. “The final list of the work division will be announced on Friday.”Earlier, the leaders said that the division of work of the leaders would be proposed on Wednesday and endorsed by Thursday.Dissatisfied by the delay in assigning the responsibilities, a group of leaders even submitted a memorandum to the party office a few months earlier.Failing to resolve the issue, leaders in November formed a task force led by party chair Nepal that included senior leader Jhalanath Khanal, Beduram Bhusal, Pramesh Hamal, Ghanendra Basnet, Rajendra Pandey, and General Secretary Bhusal.Party secretary Somnath Pandey claimed that the delay was caused not due to disputes but due to festivals and other engagements.“The party has almost completed the work division task and it will accommodate all the leaders.

The Nepali Congress central executive committee met on Monday, while the CPN-UML held a meeting of the party's secretariat on Tuesday.The main topic of discussion in both parties' meetings was Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s recent visit to China and the agreements reached during that visit.The two parties, meanwhile, have differences over the visit and the eventual agreements, especially the framework for the BRI cooperation. The government on Tuesday made the copy of the BRI cooperation framework public.Raghubir Mahaseth, a member of the UML secretariat and head of its foreign affairs department, said that the secretariat meeting had declared the prime minister's visit as a success. “As per last week’s deal between the two countries, projects would be implemented either through grants, loans or joint investment,” Mahaseth said. But the Congress meeting insisted that Nepal cannot and should not accept loans to fund BRI projects, according to joint secretary of the party, Jeevan Pariyar.“It has been our official stance that Nepal should not take loans to fund BRI projects. Our party understands the phrasing ‘Aid Assistance Financing’ in the BRI framework to mean that the country will take only grants,” Pariyar told the Post. Prime Minister Oli, however, has said that it can be either a loan or a grant. “BRI funding can be a loan, a grant, or joint investment,\" Oli said in Birtamod, Jhapa on Monday. “Some people are shouting without understanding what BRI actually means.” “If the BRI framework involves loans as well, why did the prime minister lie at a press conference at Kathmandu airport after returning from China, when he said there was no agreement to take loans?” questioned Congress joint general secretary Pariyar.The Congress calling for developing BRI projects under grants does not mean the party is against cooperation with China, Pariyar said.Congress former general secretary and influential leader Krishna Prasad Sitaula also says that the party’s decision on Monday on the financial modality for BRI projects is official. When asked whether the two ruling parties’ differing understandings of the funding method for BRI projects will affect government functioning, Sitaula denied such a possibility.“Even if the two parties have different views on the BRI financing modality there should be no difficulty in cooperation,” Situla told the Post. Mahaseth echoes Situala. The agreement was done in presence of leaders from both the parties so it should not attract any confusion, Mahaseth said. “For us, the only thing that matters is the opinion of the establishment wing of the Congress,” says UML publicity department chief Rajendra Gautam. Gautam says that what other Congress leaders say on the issue is not so important, given that the establishment wing of the Congress has already welcomed the agreement on BRI cooperation.“Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba himself has endorsed the agreement between Nepal and China under the framework for BRI cooperation,” Gautam said. “To manage the political camps in the party, they might be saying different things, but that does not carry any importance.”Again, there is no particular reason to oppose the agreement between the two countries since the agreement was done as per the blueprint prepared by a Congress-UML task force, Gautam stressed. Also, the agreement was inked in presence of Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba who is also a leader of Congress, Gautam said. Not only on the issue of BRI, the Congress also appears to be dissatisfied with other agreements reached during the Prime Minister Oli’s visit to China and some of the points made in the joint statement.Govindaraj Pokharel, Congress leader close to Shekhar Koirala and a former chair of the National Planning Commission, gave a few reasons suggesting that Nepal has deviated from the conventional foreign policy of the country which is non-alliance and the Panchsheel.Nepal used the Chinese name Xizang for Tibet and by agreeing to firmly support China’s effort to reunite Taiwan into mainland China, Nepal deviated from its foreign policy, Pokharel argued. Head of Foreign Affairs Department of UML, Mahaseth challenges Pokharel saying, “The agreement done during Prime Minister’s China visit aligns with the foreign policy of the country.”Nepal has been a staunch supporter of One China and the agreement has not deviated from it, Mahaseth added.“Being the signature party on the framework for the BRI cooperation under the ‘Aid Assistance Financing’, the Congress in future only can raise questions on the terms and conditions of the financial assistance, but it has to abide by the agreement. So supporting the document was a mistake by the party,” says Pokharel.The coalition government of Congress and UML has agreed to take soft loan, grant and technical assistance for the projects of Nepal’s interest under the BRI. Despite the party's official decision not to take loan, what made party members agree on the ‘Technical support and Aid Financing Modality’?” questioned Pokharel.Pokharel also hinted that the issue of agreement reached would stir up controversy in the party.  ","summary":"Nepal’s two largest and ruling parties were busy in internal meetings in the past few days.

Over 15 chopper flights were conducted from Lukla to 5,545 meter-high Kala Patthar. They clicked photos and selfies for a few minutes and returned to Kathmandu.The group spent nearly Rs16.20 million on chopper reservations, excluding other expenses such as hotels, transport, and national park fees, which could be worth millions of dollars.“They were high-end visitors to Nepal, who had money but no time,” said Anil Manandhar, corporate manager of Shree Airlines, Nepal’s largest helicopter operator. “As high-end tourism contributes to the long-term economic welfare of destinations, the government must know how to promote them.”But on Wednesday, chopper operators received a big jolt—beyond their imagination.From January 1, choppers will be barred from conducting sightseeing tours in the Everest region.The Sagarmatha National Park, which hosts Mt Everest, issued a circular informing all helicopter companies that they can no longer operate sightseeing flights in the national park.“We are taking this unpopular decision to provide justice to wildlife,” said Sushma Rana, senior conservation officer of the park, which has headquarters at Namche Bazaar.

In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural phenomena and unique culture, the park was included on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. “The chopper-ban is a very strange decision that will deal a huge blow to high-end tourism,” said Manandhar. Already, there are restrictions. From Kathmandu, helicopters can carry four passengers in a light and medium helicopter up to Lukla. From Lukla, the chopper can take only two passengers to Kala Patthar. Choppers are restricted from landing at the Everest base camp but can make an overfly.So, the tour operator’s itinerary usually includes the Kathmandu-Lukla-Kala Patthar flight. From there, tourists take lunch at Everest View Hotel in Syangboche and fly back.Revenue-wise, a tourist pays around Rs10,000 under different categories: Rs3,000 for park conservation, Rs2,000 for village development, and Rs900 for airport. Separately, helicopters pay Rs3,000 for each landing and parking.“The Everest sightseeing tour is Nepal’s premium product, which we have not marketed well. It can bring high-end tourists from around the world,” said Manandhar. In the peak season, there are 8-10 such flights. On Thursday, operators held an emergency meeting with the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the civil aviation regulator. The Airlines Operators’ Association of Nepal said it would only honour the regulator's decision. Issuing a press statement on Thursday evening, the association said it would not abide by the decision made by the national park as the civil aviation regulator has the sole authority to ban flights. The association, the umbrella body of the airline companies, said it would continue flights.The national park has many complaints about helicopter companies that prompted it to make such a drastic decision.Rana said they analysed three significant factors, which ultimately resulted in such an unpopular move. First, excessive noise pollution. The noise pollution in the wildlife habitat has resulted in behavioural changes in the local animals. “The sounds can cause wild animals to leave their habitat and run into the villages. Our studies show that accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising,” Rana said. The shy natural goral is found foraging and sheltering in rocky faces of mountains.“The animals jump off the cliffs in shock when choppers fly at low altitudes with big sounds. Their death cases are rising. We are doing justice to the wild animals by stopping commercial flights above the national park.”Second, according to Rana, the park has long warned helicopters to stop haphazard landings. “But no one has abided by this decision. Besides, we suspect the smuggling of wildlife contraband,” said Rana.“If helicopters ignore landing in the designated areas, we obviously cannot monitor them all. This gives us room to suspect that they are involved in smuggling.”Third, the locals say the rise in heli tours has cut their jobs. Usually, it takes 14 days for trekkers to reach Everest base camp. But most of them return by helicopter. “So chopper ride has cut jobs of porters and guides, and also affected businesses of tea houses and resorts in the Everest region,” said Rana.The park alone did not decide to ban sightseeing. Multiple stakeholders, including the local government and the local people, are involved. The Nepal Army and local youth groups have been tasked with monitoring the ban.This is not the first time the park tried to ban sightseeing flights.In October, the park office in Namche wrote to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal in Lukla, requesting a ban on helicopter flights for commercial purposes over the national park. Tour operators say that honest chopper companies have been made to suffer due to the wrongdoings of a few unethical ones that breach rules for “quick profit”. “And now authorities have imposed a blanket ban,” complained a top official of a helicopter company. In 2018, Nepal ordered a review of helicopter rescues after uncovering a multimillion-dollar scam in which climbers were pressured to take costly flights down mountains, sometimes by spiking their food. Unscrupulous operators pocketed thousands of dollars from insurance companies by making multiple claims for a single chopper ride or pushing trekkers to agree to airlifts for minor illnesses.Scammers can charge thousands of dollars for a helicopter rescue.According to Rana, the conservation officer, more than 6,000 choppers fly above the national park in the spring and autumn seasons. Rescue flights for tourists and trekkers will still be allowed. However, they, too, must secure recommendation letters from nearby health institutions, buffer zone committees, or ward offices. According to operators, rescue operations were already lengthy. “Now, the process could be impossible to complete.” These flights must be approved by the park office, and detailed records of the individuals to be rescued must be submitted. According to the new rule, the rescue chopper should be fully equipped, and the patient should be treated at Pasang Lhamu-Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla.

The project is estimated to cost $505 million, and the Nepal government will contribute $86 million.On Monday, a team consisting ADB country director for Nepal Arnaud Cauchois and Nepal Electricity Authority executive director Kulman Ghising, including the chairman of the board of directors of Tanahu Hydropower Limited, conducted on-site monitoring of the project and instructed it to complete the construction on time.Under the project's social development programme, the rural electrification and distribution system to electrify Tanahun district has been completed through the project management directorate of the Nepal Authority.Under this, two 33/11 kV substations for local electricity supply have been built and operated in Ghiring Rural Municipality-4 and Bandipur Rural Municipality-6.A 33 kV line has been constructed to supply electricity to the substations.The project said that distribution transformers of different capacities have been installed, and 11 kV lines have been constructed in various places to make the electricity supply of Tanahun district sufficient, reliable and of good quality.Under the community development programme, 63 projects, including education, health, drinking water, roads, river embankment construction, etc., have been completed in the project-affected areas. Ten projects are currently running. Various skill-based trainings are being conducted to generate livelihood and income for project-affected people.Tanahu Hydropower Limited, a subsidiary of Nepal Electricity Authority, has also advanced the development of the 126MW Lower Seti Hydropower project downstream of the Seti river.The Consultant, JV of WAPCOS Limited, India and Nippon Koei Co. Ltd, Japan, submitted the final Detailed Design Report in June 2024.

According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 952 people killed themselves by consuming poison in the fiscal year 2023-24. “Poison is easily available in every household in rural areas across the country, as farmers often keep it in the house to use in crops,” said Dr Dilli Ram Sharma, former director general at the Department of Agriculture. “These hazardous substances are easily available in agri-veterinary shops and are not only being used in plants but also for suicide in our country.”Earlier, in 2018, the country banned eight pesticides—carbofuran, dichlorvos, triazophos, carbaryl, benomyl, carbosulfan, dicofol, and aluminum phosphide. Following the ban, suicides by poison ingestion have dramatically declined, according to Nepal Police report.Police data show that 1,320 people died by poison ingestion in 2018-19, the year authorities banned eight pesticides commonly used for suicide. The numbers dropped to 1,136 in 2019-20; 1,276 in 2020-21; 1040 in 2021-22 and 932 in 2022-23. Sharma said that traders can sell their existing stock of banned poisonous substances for up to two years, but cannot import more.“These pesticides are so hazardous that they can cause cancer, paralysis, renal failure, heart diseases in children, and deformities in newborn babies if used for a long time,” said Sharma. “Many countries, including India, have banned these pesticides.”After the ban on aluminium phosphide in 2018, people in crisis began ingesting chlorpyrifos, which is widely available on the market. Studies show that banning highly hazardous pesticides is a cost-effective and affordable intervention to reduce suicide rates. Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates. The country witnessed an alarming rise in suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year. “Restricting access to commonly used hazardous pesticides will help reduce deaths from suicides,” said Dr Rakesh Ghimire, principal investigator of Nepal for the Center for Pesticide Suicide Prevention at the University of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom, which has been carrying out research on suicides by poison ingestion in Nepal. “Many people who are in a moment of crisis can change their minds if they do not have access to poisonous substances.”Studies show that a ban on a few highly hazardous pesticides in Bangladesh, South Korea, and Sri Lanka, among others, led to sharp reductions in overall suicide rates. Pesticides are commonly used to get rid of insects, fungi, weeds and diseases which damage plants and crops. Every year more than 1,300 metric tons of 135 types of pesticides, including insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and biopesticide, are brought into Nepal, according to the Plant Protection Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.Doctors say high levels of pesticides in fruits and vegetables cause nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dizziness and anxiety. Long-term consumption of fruits and vegetables with high levels of pesticides can lead to kidney failure, lung disease and mental health problems, and can even cause cancer. According to health experts, the consumption of such fruits and vegetables may also affect pregnant women and harm the foetus.

Since 2016, neonatal deaths have not declined, despite various measures implemented by health authorities.According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births.Doctors say feeding low-weight babies and critically ill neonates in intensive care units can significantly reduce the risk of infections. The bank collects, tests, pasteurises and stores donor milk from lactating mothers.“The milk is collected mostly from the mothers of ailing babies, who cannot breastfeed their infants admitted to the intensive care units,” said Dr Sailendra Bir Karmacharya, a senior consultant paediatrician of the hospital. “We provide milk only to infants weighing less than 1,000 grams.”According to doctors, human breast milk contains the best source of nutrition and ensures the survival and healthy growth of babies. It bolsters brain development and has lifelong benefits for both the baby and the mother.Karmacharya said that human milk helps in reducing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature babies. Officials said the hospital needs 1.5 to 2.5 litres of breast milk for babies admitted to the intensive care unit. The human milk bank collects milk directly from mothers of hospitalised babies, but it collects only surplus milk from other lactating mothers, which is then tested, pasteurised and stored at minus 40 degrees Celsius. The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. The 16th five-year periodic plan, which ends in 2029, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from 21 per 1,000 live births. The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes, including hiring staff nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding has the potential to prevent 13 percent of under-five deaths. Studies show that Nepal's exclusive breastfeeding rate has steadily declined over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022, exclusive breastfeeding dropped consistently from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It stated that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), compared to 12 percent of those born at home.Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is prone to contamination and increases the risk of diseases in children, according to the World Health Organisation.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to breastfeed their babies, as studies show. The report shows that the proportion of children who are bottle-fed increases with mothers’ education, rising from 12 percent among children of mothers with no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Bottle-feeding is most common in the highest wealth quintile—46 percent—and least common in the lowest wealth quintile—11 percent.Among the seven provinces of Nepal, exclusive breastfeeding rates are the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest at 11 percent in Karnali Province, 12 percent in Madhesh Province and the highest at 43 percent in Bagmati Province.Doctors recommend breastfeeding for the first two years of a baby’s life or longer, as breast milk lowers the risk of illness in children, promotes their recovery during illness, and provides important nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” ","summary":"Chaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread.

If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” "},{"hash":"7ea85e731597bdeb1671d95bca3078159d53ed7499444aaf8b71b7db12d28349","title":"the-kumari-tradition-lives-on-balancing-ancient-and-modern-values","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/08/01/the-kumari-tradition-lives-on-balancing-ancient-and-modern-values","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/kumari-1722472781.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1722470400000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. ","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo.

With AI algorithms increasingly dictating content and influencing societal perspectives, misinformation and disinformation have become rampant. The monetisation of many social media platforms has led to the production and circulation of viral content, regardless of their credibility and accuracy. So, professional journalism’s need to act as a firewall against fake news, deepfakes, context-free information and other forms of misleading content has become more crucial. Journalism is one of the most essential professions for maintaining public trust, particularly in developing nations like ours with low media and information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. The foundational principles of journalism—truth, transparency, accountability, information verification and ethical reporting—must be the guiding tenets for an informed society in the age of AI.Misinformation in the digital landscapeSeveral social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube and X, have been criticised for their role in rapidly disseminating misinformation, disinformation and propaganda, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, misinformation on pandemic prevention methods, such as the unfounded claim that turmeric water could cure the virus, spread rapidly in Nepal and beyond. On April 26, Sidhakura.com, a Nepali news portal, published fabricated audio entitled “The Dark Files”, raising considerable concern among stakeholders on the potential misuse of AI technology. These digital platforms use algorithms that optimise user engagement, often prioritising sensational and polarising content over factual accuracy. Concurrently, generative AI’s advent has disrupted media practices and altered journalistic gatekeeping processes.Generative AI has become one of the most deceptive threats to journalism since we wholeheartedly accept its outputs. This is called technological somnambulism, a philosophical concept that illustrates our tendency to be unaware of how technology is changing the conditions of human existence. These fake, hyper-realistic audiovisuals have been exploited to manipulate public opinion, tarnish reputations and interfere with electoral processes. In March 2022, shortly after the Russia-Ukraine war began, Russian agents produced a deepfake video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, allegedly ordering his troops to surrender to the Russian army. In June, the White House administration reported that President Joe Biden had fallen victim to a deepfake video. Biden admitted in a press conference that he could not recognise a deepfake video of his own at first glance. These instances highlight how the rapidly advancing AI-powered tools undermine the public’s hard-won trust in established media and journalistic practices. Without journalistic intervention, these manipulative tools could mislead substantial segments of the population. Investigating and verifying such claims remains vital in combating the infodemic propagated on digital platforms. So, AI tools cannot supplant the need for professional journalism in any society. Journalism over AI-generated contentIn several workshops focused on the impact of AI on journalism, in which I participated, many journalists reported utilising several AI tools, including ChatGPT, Midjourney and Google Gemini, for content creation, restructuring and copy-editing of news reports. However, they seldom disclosed their use of AI in news production. While the automation of content generation enhances efficiency, it fails to uphold transparency, contextual understanding and ethics. Further, it can create echo chambers and reinforce existing biases. For example, algorithmic biases in search engines, as highlighted by Johanna Burai’s “The World White Web” campaign against the prevailing whiteness of the Internet, along with Latanya Sweeney’s research on discriminatory advertisement delivery based on racial names, underscore the dangers of perpetuating stereotypical perceptions.In contrast to AI tools, human reporters can investigate complex societal issues, comprehend cultural sensitivities and contextualise stories in ways that algorithms cannot. According to a 2024 study by Pew Research Centre, a US-based think-tank organisation, majority of Americans still trust professional journalists more than AI-generated content. In 2023, after introducing AI news anchors on Indian television, local audiences were asked about their perceptions of automated news content and AI-powered news anchors. Many of the respondents expressed their frustrations over the mechanical news anchoring. Moreover, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation, stated that professional journalism has become essential, as it has played a fundamental role in dispelling myths and clarifying scientific information about the pandemic.Journalism's relevanceOne of the most critical functions of journalists is acting as watchdogs for those in power. AI tools or social media platforms cannot replace this as they are not designed for it. For example, investigative journalism—whether uncovering the US Watergate scandal in 1972 or exposing the fake Bhutanese refugee scam involving the government agencies of Nepal—demands the professionalism and expertise of human journalists. Originality cannot be replicated by algorithms prioritising engagement metrics, financial gains, or serving political agendas over societal well-being. Journalism should be responsible for scrutinising these systems, exposing their biases, and advocating for ethical technological development. As AI-powered tools can provide substantial assistance in data analysis, fact-checking and audience engagement, they must act as complementary tools in journalism. This will allow journalists to dedicate more time to in-depth storytelling and investigative reporting. News organisations must innovate with AI tools while upholding their commitment to the public good. When employed responsibly, AI has the potential to enhance sustainable journalism, helping it thrive in an increasingly complex media landscape.  ","summary":"In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), media professionals often encounter questions about the importance of journalism.

AI tools or social media platforms cannot replace this as they are not designed for it. For example, investigative journalism—whether uncovering the US Watergate scandal in 1972 or exposing the fake Bhutanese refugee scam involving the government agencies of Nepal—demands the professionalism and expertise of human journalists. Originality cannot be replicated by algorithms prioritising engagement metrics, financial gains, or serving political agendas over societal well-being. Journalism should be responsible for scrutinising these systems, exposing their biases, and advocating for ethical technological development. As AI-powered tools can provide substantial assistance in data analysis, fact-checking and audience engagement, they must act as complementary tools in journalism. This will allow journalists to dedicate more time to in-depth storytelling and investigative reporting. News organisations must innovate with AI tools while upholding their commitment to the public good. When employed responsibly, AI has the potential to enhance sustainable journalism, helping it thrive in an increasingly complex media landscape.  "},{"hash":"73fccb6d8fd3b99ade440c67bfe7ce47dff27fc631c893149a5789bcf6180ba6","title":"dollar-after-trump","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/12/12/dollar-after-trump","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/DownShutterstock-1734009947.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733961600000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Donald Trump’s victory in November’s US presidential election saw the US dollar strengthen. It surged to a one-year high within two weeks, and has since retained its strength against its major peers. His election has also again brought the prospect of US tariffs on imports, and attention has focused on the disruption to global trade that these may bring.As part of this, Trump made a not-so-veiled threat of steep levies on the Brics group of leading emerging markets should they create a rival to the US dollar, which has been the world’s “dominant currency” since the second world war.The use and holding of the US dollar by other countries is known as dollarisation. It has different levels of meaning, from countries like Panama using the US dollar as their currency, to its use in the pricing of major internationally traded commodities, and as a reserve and vehicle currency. This latter role enhances global trade.Take Chile and Malaysia as an example. Any trade between these two countries will involve the exchange of Chilean pesos for Malaysian ringgit, for which there is not a large and active market. So, pesos are instead exchanged for US dollars and US dollars for ringgit, allowing trade to occur in a quicker and more cost-efficient manner.Indeed, the US dollar is used in more than 50 percent of foreign trade invoices, and over 80 percent of all foreign exchange transactions worldwide. However, it is possible that Trump’s “America First” foreign policy could serve to hasten the end of the US dollar’s dominance.Pros and consDollarisation is beneficial for global trade. But it brings particular benefits to the US, as other countries need to hold US dollars to facilitate trade and pay for many commodities. This means that demand for the US dollar remains high, so it does not come under pressure to depreciate.A more important point is perhaps that when countries buy US dollars, they don’t hold them in cash. Rather, they buy US Treasury bills and so, in effect, lend money to the US government. This high demand for US Treasuries means the US government is able borrow at a cheaper rate than would otherwise be possible.However, there are also drawbacks. A strong US dollar increases the price of dollar-denominated commodities and thus the cost of international trade. And for the US itself, a strong US dollar can damage its domestic export business.These drawbacks have often led to the suggestion of a multi-currency global system, although this has never gained traction or been a serious consideration. But that could change with a second Trump presidency.During his first term, such calls grew louder. And there have been some shifts in US dollar holdings since then, to the extent that global US dollar reserves have declined.So, which Trump policies could hasten the end of US dollar dominance? The incoming president is regarded as pro-business, which will probably translate into policies aimed at lowering regulation and taxes. Stimulating domestic growth will lead to an even stronger US dollar at a time when global output is more modest.A stronger US dollar, as mentioned above, also increases the price of oil and similar commodities. Countries will inevitably ask themselves why oil from Saudi Arabia, for example, should be paid for in US dollars as those dollars become more expensive.Trump’s economic policies are likely to increase US debt, and this can reduce the value of the large US dollar reserves held around the world. According to one study, Trump’s plans could add as much as US$15 trillion (£11.7 trillion) to the nation’s debt over a decade. A fall in the value of US dollar reserves may result in some countries being less willing to hold US debt.The effect of these policies might be considered unintentional. But other policies, such as Trump’s plan for higher tariffs, are more deliberately designed.A strong US dollar damages US exports, as they become relatively expensive in local currency terms, and makes imports relatively cheap. Tariffs are a way to protect domestic producers from this international competition.However, assuming no other country retaliates, raising tariffs will serve only to further strengthen the US dollar, as fewer imports will mean less US dollars being sold in the foreign exchange market. This will, at least in part, undo the effect of the tariff policy while imposing trade costs globally.To avoid elements of this, countries could agree to use alternatives as a reserve currency and a means to pay for international commodities. The BRICS nations have mooted a separate currency, which could revolve around one or more existing currencies like the Euro or Yuan. Trump’s threats may simply speed up this search for an alternative.What would this mean for the US?Countries would then need to hold less US dollars, so would sell off their US Treasuries. The result will be a rise in the cost of debt for the US, and a fall in the value of the US dollar. Ironically, this would increase the price of imports (the goal of Trump’s tariff policy), but it could also lead to inflation.In a worst-case scenario, should countries coordinate their selling of US dollars and Treasuries, a run on the US dollar would have major implications for the US and the world. This would lead to higher debt costs in the US and a need to reduce its trade deficit.Globally, it would disrupt trade, raise transaction costs, and there would be a loss of value for any dollar-denominated assets and reserves. This would most likely culminate in a significant global recession.The US dollar will remain a global currency for the foreseeable future.

In sum, these progressive practices added vigour to the Congress. But the party has consistently failed to hold its conventions on time.

After the temporary structures they were putting up in were worn down by wind and rain, students in schools like Janapriya Basic School and Shankar Bhawan Secondary School in Rukum West and Jajarkot district, respectively, have been compelled to sit in classrooms with gaping cracks. Instead of being a secure learning space, classrooms in quake-damaged schools have turned into places where students are in perpetual fear for their safety. Last week, the Karnali province government finally initiated the reconstruction of damaged buildings of community schools and health institutions. The decision has already come too late. The students’ lives cannot be endangered while waiting for the rebuilding to be completed. On November 3 last year, the earthquake damaged several community schools, health institutions and homes in Jajarkot, Rukum West, and Salyan districts. Many displaced families still await the promised funds under fragile, temporary huts. Some victims had to take loans even to build temporary shelters as the government’s promise of providing Rs50,000 per household for such shelters has failed to materialise.This delay in relief has claimed over three dozen lives, mainly of the elderly and children in Jajarkot and Rukum West. Children’s education in these areas was hit as well: 143 schools in Jajarkot and 192 schools in Rukum West were completely destroyed in the earthquake, according to the Social Development Ministry in Karnali. The quake partially damaged 296 school buildings in Jajarkot, 509 in Rukum West and 42 in Salyan, forcing hundreds of students to continue their education in temporary structures while they are exposed to wind, rain and cold.Such conditions only worsen the situation in a province that is barely managing to attract students to schools. According to the Ministry of Social Development, Karnali, there are fewer than 10 students each in 137 community schools in the province. The Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) 2022-23 reports that Karnali has a literacy rate of 76.6 percent, one of the lowest of the seven provinces. Due to the unavailability of teachers and the absence of quality education, many students have lost faith in local schools. Absenteeism is rampant, and many young men migrate to India for work rather than get educated. The provincial Ministry of Physical Infrastructures and Urban Development has allocated Rs500 million in the current fiscal year to reconstruct quake-damaged public buildings, including community schools and health institutions. The ministry aims to complete the reconstruction in the current fiscal year, but just monetary allocation won’t ensure results. The project recommendation committees in earthquake-affected districts had identified damaged school and health institution buildings and submitted their reports. The reconstruction could not proceed until the Provincial Council of Ministers had approved the Reconstruction of Earthquake-Damaged School and Health Institution Programme (Operation and Management) Guidelines-2024. The approval was given only last month. Delays like this are bound to cost more lives. Moreover, experts warn that the western region is at risk of a major earthquake, as it has not experienced significant tremors in over 500 years. Earthquakes are inevitable, but the scale of devastation is not. It is unacceptable that students are putting their lives at risk for education. Children in disaster-stricken areas have already endured trauma, having lost their homes and loved ones. Making them study in classrooms that are still damaged is akin to forcing them to experience the same fear all over again. Any compromise in speeding up reconstruction and allowing these children to study in a safe environment will be a criminal offence.  ","summary":"The recent news of students in Karnali returning to the quake-damaged schools a year after the 6.3 magnitude earthquake that struck Jajarkot and Rukum West districts is appalling.

Their action was widely hailed as a big milestone in Nepal’s transitional justice process. But now, when time has come to pick the candidates for the two important transitional justice bodies—the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP)—which have been without office-bearers since 2022, the parties are faltering. The names shortlisted as potential office-bearers of these commissions have sparked controversy, with conflict victims accusing the parties of overlooking their concerns.These commissions’ role in concluding Nepal’s peace process is pivotal. The CIEDP was formed to find the whereabouts of the disappeared persons, recommend reparation to victims and prosecute the accused related to the armed conflict. Similarly, the TRC is there to investigate serious human rights violations, identify those involved and recommend reparative and legal measures. It also envisioned reconciliation, mutual goodwill and peace between perpetrators and victims. Yet, they have fallen woefully short of the expectations of both victims and rights activists. Due to a lack of competence and constant political meddling, they haven’t progressed beyond collecting complaints and conducting initial investigations in a handful of cases. This is the third time the government is appointing officials to these commissions. Still, past mistakes in the selection of office-bearers are being repeated, as a recommendation committee has been formed under the leadership of a person who botched the same job in 2020. The chairpersons and members of the two commissions nominated under him had failed to perform their duties. The names shortlisted this time have also disappointed rights activists and victims alike. Despite their repeated calls to select the commissions’ leaderships through a consultative, transparent and inclusive process, their concerns went unheeded. The list, in the eyes of rights activists and victims, prioritises controversial figures over competent and deserving ones. This leaves one wondering if the parties had a hidden agenda behind the August agreement, as it seems partisan interests have again prevailed over national healing. The politicisation and manipulation of these commissions’ selection processes will not ensure justice for the victims of the insurgency. When the parties united to conclude the process back in August, the international community had immediately welcomed the move, but the new controversy over the shortlisted names again risks discrediting the whole process, both at home and abroad. What’s more concerning is that the National Human Rights Commission, which should have acted as a watchdog in the process, is silent, perhaps because one NHRC commissioner is a member of the recommendation panel. The rights watchdog’s complicity will further erode its public trust. Justice delayed has already become justice denied for many conflict victims. For the transitional justice process to come to a successful end, top political leaders and parties must rise above petty interests and acknowledge long-term damage their misjudgement can inflict on the conflict victims who have now waited for justice for nearly two decades since the guns fell silent in 2006. If these commissions again fail in their responsibilities, it will be seen as a sign of the failure of the democratic process in the country. Nepal needs competent people in the two commissions, those with unwavering integrity and commitment to justice.

We have ample evidence now that compromised transitional justice bodies cannot work in the interest of victims.   "},{"hash":"c056a6a84ce5bdf5167169c2eed5e468f9dcf45bfe497f6fc0c6d13654dd7535","title":"toothless-committees","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/12/08/toothless-committees","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/thumb3-1733659411.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733616000000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"Provincial assembly parliamentary committees are pivotal to strengthening federalism in Nepal. These committees work to hold provincial governments accountable. Even when the assembly is not in session, the committees can continue working. As the provincial assemblies cannot manage all the tasks, these committees, with various thematic jurisdiction and expertise, work by often rising above partisan interest to save the parliament’s time; they simplify work and conduct various studies. Article 193 of the Constitution of Nepal specifies that “the State Assembly may, as per its rules, form committees or special committees, as required, to manage its working procedures”. Thus, the number of thematic areas varies in each province. However, the functioning of these committees is undermined in several provinces. In Karnali, three of the four parliamentary committees—the Finance and Natural Resources Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Social Development Committee—are currently without heads. While the first committee has had no chief since April this year, the latter two have been vacant for three months. The prolonged leadership vacuum in important committees is also something that is routinely seen in other provinces. The five committees in Bagmati were at a standstill without chairpersons for more than a year since the first session of the start of the second term of the Bagmati Provincial Assembly in January 2023. The parliamentary committees in Lumbini and Sudurpaschim have been without their chairs after the formation of their respective assemblies last year. The absence of chiefs of these key provincial assembly parliamentary committees makes it difficult to hold the provincial governments accountable. These governments fail on governance, budget implementation and role assignment to the provincial assemblies. Passage of essential bills is also hampered.

During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  ","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China.

First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  "},{"hash":"6aefa87c5372da415729ba34119f452b28f118961283653d01b79fc38080bcb7","title":"rather-than-a-bridge-nepal-should-try-to-develop-as-a-port","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/12/02/rather-than-a-bridge-nepal-should-try-to-develop-as-a-port","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/interviews/Chinesemain-1733100908.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733097600000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"Wang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best.

He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  ","summary":"Former Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media?

A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  ","summary":"Indian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region.
