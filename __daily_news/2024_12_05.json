Meanwhile, the Mumbai Crime Branch has arrested four individuals linked to Siddique's murder, with three suspects still at large.\n(Inputs from ANI)\n\n"},{"hash":"2120878708cd76dfcf1dedc0064b47176eec096699a86f43a3f66e9fd91ae436","title":"taking-shravani-bath-at-devghat","date":1724004900000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/entertainment-and-lifestyle/taking-shravani-bath-at-devghat","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/SA_NARAYANGADH_IMG_15201724041715_1024.jpg","category":"entertainment-and-lifestyle","content":null,"summary":null},{"hash":"b414a9d455467ee29f8eb768feed33745e2597ec08893ea66886f03f2373b097","title":"nepal-and-china-sign-framework-for-bri-cooperation-in-beijing","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/12/05/nepal-and-china-sign-framework-for-bri-cooperation-in-beijing","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Untitled2-1733298484.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733336100000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"Seven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries.

They say this could hurt the peace process and harm the work of the commissions.\n\nThe selection committee has not released a list of candidates, causing delays. The committee says it's waiting for approval from major political leaders.\n\nSome victims and rights groups have spoken out against a specific candidate, Sudip Pathak, who they believe is not suitable for the role.\n\nThe statement from the rights workers says that candidates should be impartial, have good reputations, and be accepted by victims and civil society. They urge the committee to choose candidates fairly and without bias.\n\nThe committee says it wants to find the best candidates, but it takes time to check their qualifications. It plans to release a list of candidates by the end of the week.","summary":"Amid a delay in publishing a shortlist of office-bearer candidates for the two transitional justice commissions, a section of the human rights activists has expressed concern over suspected attempts to pick candidates on partisan basis.In a statement on Wednesday, they claimed that conspiracies are being hatched against the selection of office bearers through a competitive process.“Such unwarranted political interference in the selection process will once again put the transitional justice process at risk and undermine the national goal of completing the remaining tasks of the peace process,” reads the statement.They are concerned as the committee formed to recommend the chairpersons and members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons struggles to publish a shortlist more than two weeks after the extended application deadline ended.Against the claim that it would shortlist the candidates latest by November end, the Om Prakash Mishra-led committee hasn’t been able to do so. Those aware of the developments say the selection committee is waiting for the consent of the top leadership of three major parties. In particular, it awaits the return of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who also is CPN-UML chairperson, from China before publishing the shortlist. Though the committee has already met the top leaders individually, it wants Oli, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Centre) chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal to get their approvals on the names.The committee had received 156 applications from retired judges, government officials, legal experts, rights defenders, and the victims of the decade-long Maoist insurgency. However, it considered only 128 names, claiming that the remaining 28 individuals were recommended by different organisations without their personal consent. The Mishra-led panel wants to include some of the 28 names after getting their consent. Yet, these personnel being considered apparently won’t give their consent unless their appointments are assured. In addition, the selection committee is under pressure to recommend Sudip Pathak, a former member of the National Human Rights Commission, to chair a commission. However, the victims and human rights defenders are against his nomination. This puts the committee in a fix.Without naming Pathak, the rights defenders’ statement stresses that individuals with questionable integrity, those who courted controversies in their past constitutional responsibilities and the ones who have failed to gain legitimacy from the victims’ communities and civil society should not be recommended for transitional justice commissions. It would be unacceptable for such persons to be included in the selection process, as it would make the entire process contentious, reads the statement.“Pathak has a controversial image as a member of the human rights commission. The statement is targeted at him,” one of the signatories to the statement told the Post. A group of victims and human rights defenders on Wednesday met Deuba to draw his attention against Pathak’s nomination. In response, Deuba said he has already given his word to Pathak but was still ready to reconsider if there are better alternatives, according to a member of the group who spoke to the Congress leader.On Tuesday, victims’ representatives, along with some human rights activists, met United Nations Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer-Hamdy to discuss the UN’s role in the overall transitional justice process. “We also discussed the impartiality in the selection of the office bearers,” Gopal Shah, chairperson of the Conflict Victims National Network, told the Post.The statement undersigned by Sushil Pyakurel, Subodh Pyakurel, Kanak Mani Dixit, Kundan Aryal, Charan Prasai, Mandira Sharma, Rajan Kuikel, Raju Prasad Chapagain and Suman Adhikari says the credibility and success of the entire transitional justice process depends on the selection of officials who have the capacity to fulfill the huge responsibility of transitional justice. “We, therefore, strongly urge the recommendation committee to carry out the selection process independently, impartially, and transparently without any compromise,” reads the statement. “We want to warn the recommendation committee that failure to carry out their duties properly would be a betrayal to the nation.”The selection committee, however, says it wants to recommend the best candidates for the 10 positions—five members each, including the chair, in the two commissions—and it was taking time. “Checking the backgrounds, qualifications and expertise of so many candidates takes time. We plan to publish a shortlist by the end of this week,” Khamma Khati, spokesperson for the committee, told the Post. “We will recommend the best persons to lead the commissions through a fair and impartial process.” "},{"hash":"6511789e5ac35cb9396b552681c041735b4198578ce7a9d5ea73abcde8883d76","title":"A new organic fertilizer plant has opened in western Nepal with an investment of 300 million rupees.

This is a time for students to focus on final preparations. Sadly, hard work alone won’t yield better results when the schools and curriculum fail to cater to their needs. Every year, when the results are out, many students have to endure crushing failure. However, as in previous years, the authorities have failed to learn from their mistakes. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is making baseless predictions of a 70 percent pass rate in the upcoming SEE. How will this be achieved in a country where pass rates have for years hovered below 50 percent?Among 464,785 students who appeared in the last SEE, only 222,472—47.87 percent—secured a Grade Point Average (GPA) above 1.60, which is necessary to study at a higher level. However, 242,313 students—52.13 percent—were categorised as non-graded. After the supplementary exams, over a third of them were graded, qualifying them to study in grade 11. Oli’s forecast is only plausible if the results improve by around 50 percent, which is unlikely. The grading system was introduced in 2016 to reform the examination system, focusing less on marks and more on interactive learning. But the hangover of the old School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams persists. While the system has been upgraded, the teaching and learning are still the same. Schools are grappling with a shortage of teachers for major subjects like Science, Mathematics and English. Rural provinces like Karnali have suffered the most and some schools are hiring under-qualified teachers to fill the gaps. With teachers unable to address their problems, students have no choice but to rely on rote learning. To cope, the government is focusing on extra online classes. But such online classes for school students hold only symbolic value. In Nepal, fear has always been a tool for teaching and learning. Most schools do not foster an environment where students enjoy learning. This mentality also applies to how the education system views examinations like SEE. Students are put under pressure to perform well, as if it were a “do or die” situation. The shame of failure scars students for life. Some private schools take advantage of this fragile emotional state of students by enforcing mandatory tuition classes. Further, as schools in rural areas can’t complete the syllabus on time, it creates an opportunity for private tuition centres to generate profit as students migrate a few months before SEE to study in such centres. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres.Schedule 8 of the constitution gives local units the authority to manage school education. But the lack of a Federal Education Act, a must to implement constitutional provisions, is a big hurdle towards this laudable goal. Among its various flaws, the controversial Education Bill, registered in Parliament last year, fails to establish minimum criteria for establishing schools. The government must realise that the basics must be fulfilled before setting lofty goals. There must be mechanisms to recruit qualified teachers and retain them. It is also imperative to update the pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. The SEE marks the culmination of over a decade of schooling. Therefore, it is unfair to blame the students who have trusted the system for long. The poor SEE results are a direct reflection of the system’s failure. Whether we have the SEE or the SLC, the flawed education system will continue to jeopardise the future of hundreds of thousands of young students.  ","summary":"In under four months, tenth graders all over Nepal will appear in the School Education Examination (SEE). This is a time for students to focus on final preparations. Sadly, hard work alone won’t yield better results when the schools and curriculum fail to cater to their needs. Every year, when the results are out, many students have to endure crushing failure. However, as in previous years, the authorities have failed to learn from their mistakes. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is making baseless predictions of a 70 percent pass rate in the upcoming SEE. How will this be achieved in a country where pass rates have for years hovered below 50 percent?Among 464,785 students who appeared in the last SEE, only 222,472—47.87 percent—secured a Grade Point Average (GPA) above 1.60, which is necessary to study at a higher level. However, 242,313 students—52.13 percent—were categorised as non-graded. After the supplementary exams, over a third of them were graded, qualifying them to study in grade 11. Oli’s forecast is only plausible if the results improve by around 50 percent, which is unlikely. The grading system was introduced in 2016 to reform the examination system, focusing less on marks and more on interactive learning. But the hangover of the old School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams persists. While the system has been upgraded, the teaching and learning are still the same. Schools are grappling with a shortage of teachers for major subjects like Science, Mathematics and English. Rural provinces like Karnali have suffered the most and some schools are hiring under-qualified teachers to fill the gaps. With teachers unable to address their problems, students have no choice but to rely on rote learning. To cope, the government is focusing on extra online classes. But such online classes for school students hold only symbolic value. In Nepal, fear has always been a tool for teaching and learning. Most schools do not foster an environment where students enjoy learning. This mentality also applies to how the education system views examinations like SEE. Students are put under pressure to perform well, as if it were a “do or die” situation. The shame of failure scars students for life. Some private schools take advantage of this fragile emotional state of students by enforcing mandatory tuition classes. Further, as schools in rural areas can’t complete the syllabus on time, it creates an opportunity for private tuition centres to generate profit as students migrate a few months before SEE to study in such centres. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres.Schedule 8 of the constitution gives local units the authority to manage school education. But the lack of a Federal Education Act, a must to implement constitutional provisions, is a big hurdle towards this laudable goal. Among its various flaws, the controversial Education Bill, registered in Parliament last year, fails to establish minimum criteria for establishing schools. The government must realise that the basics must be fulfilled before setting lofty goals. There must be mechanisms to recruit qualified teachers and retain them. It is also imperative to update the pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. The SEE marks the culmination of over a decade of schooling. Therefore, it is unfair to blame the students who have trusted the system for long. The poor SEE results are a direct reflection of the system’s failure. Whether we have the SEE or the SLC, the flawed education system will continue to jeopardise the future of hundreds of thousands of young students.  "},{"hash":"cb8f64998e3cafa77f3f4db97ff21b577be173421018e671ff79c4d1f7ef4ac8","title":"the-spectre-of-a-covfefe-world","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/12/03/the-spectre-of-a-covfefe-world","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/WhatsAppImage20241203at23315PM-1733242744.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733163300000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli chose New York as his first visit abroad to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly.

Meanwhile, the Paramount Leader of China Deng Xiaoping had already started a modernisation drive in the 1980s with his oft-quoted command: “observe calmly, secure our position, cope with affairs calmly, hide our capacities and bide our time, be good at maintaining a low profile, and never claim leadership.” Exalted with the title of “core leader”, President Xi Jinping has built the structure of global ascendency on the ground that Mao broke with the help of President Nixon in the 1970s. President Deng laid the foundation with the cooperation of President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, and President Jiang Zemin erected a scaffold of export-led growth with the collaboration of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which culminated in China being admitted into the World Trade Organisation.Despite its status of being the technological giant and a military superpower throughout the Cold War, Moscow lacked the economic muscle to challenge the hegemony of Washington that had been institutionalised through the Bretten Wood Sisters—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group—that undergirded the global trade and industry.

By comparison, Apple alone is worth about $3.7 trillion.Bitcoin’s march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of “decentralised finance” in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago.Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump’s sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress.Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday’s Asian morning, it was soon above $103,000 and was last fetching $103,335 .“We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital.“Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.”Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.“We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, US investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund.On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to \"develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms,\" and the Chamber of Digital Commerce.“Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith.“We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation.”A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council.PART OF THE LANDSCAPEBitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns.Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange.

But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up.” ","summary":"Bitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by sceptics as a coming-of-age for cryptocurrencies as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement cryptos' place in financial markets.The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record just shy of $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple alone is worth about $3.7 trillion.Bitcoin’s march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of “decentralised finance” in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago.Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump’s sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress.Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday’s Asian morning, it was soon above $103,000 and was last fetching $103,335 .“We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital.“Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.”Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.“We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, US investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund.On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to \"develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms,\" and the Chamber of Digital Commerce.“Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith.“We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation.”A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council.PART OF THE LANDSCAPEBitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns.Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed.Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally.US-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election.“Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money,” said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.“Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalised,” he said. “If you fast forward a number of years on trading floors you'll have a sales and trading desk...which will sit alongside FX and rates and commodities.”It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock’s ETF in November.Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and exchange operator Coinbase each up around 65% in November.Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies.‘WHO CAN PROHIBIT IT’The cryptocurrency industry has been criticised for its massive energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, and the underlying technology is yet to deliver a major revolution in the way money moves around the globe.Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: “Who can prohibit it?

He is expected to do so on Thursday morning, French media reported.The hard left and far right punished Barnier for using special constitutional powers to adopt part of an unpopular budget without a final vote in parliament, where it lacked majority support. The draft budget had sought 60 billion euros ($63.07 billion) in savings in a drive to shrink a gaping deficit.“This (deficit) reality will not disappear by the magic of a motion of censure,” Barnier told lawmakers ahead of the vote, adding the budget deficit would come back to haunt whichever government comes next.No French government had lost a confidence vote since Georges Pompidou’s in 1962. Macron ushered in the crisis by calling a snap election in June that delivered a polarised parliament.With its president diminished, France now risks ending the year without a stable government or a 2025 budget, although the constitution allows special measures that would avert a US-style government shutdown.France’s political turmoil will further weaken a European Union already reeling from the implosion of Germany’s coalition government, and weeks before US President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House.The country's outgoing defence minister Sebastien Lecornu warned the turmoil could impact French support for Ukraine.The hard left France Unbowed (LFI) party demanded Macron’s resignation.Barnier’s demise was cheered by far-right chief Marine Le Pen, who has sought for years to portray her National Rally party as a government in waiting.“I’m not pushing for Macron’s resignation,” she said. “The pressure on the president will get greater and greater. Only he will make that decision.”NO EASY EXIT FROM FRENCH POLITICAL CRISISFrance now faces a period of deep political uncertainty that is already unnerving investors in French sovereign bonds and stocks. Earlier this week, France's borrowing costs briefly exceeded those of Greece, generally considered far more risky.Macron must now make a choice. The Elysee Palace said the president would address the nation on Thursday evening.Three sources told Reuters that Macron aimed to install a new prime minister swiftly, with one saying he wanted to name a premier before a ceremony to reopen the Notre-Dame Cathedral on Saturday, which Trump is due to attend.Any new prime minister would face the same challenges as Barnier in getting bills, including the 2025 budget, adopted by a divided parliament. There can be no new parliamentary election before July.Macron could alternatively ask Barnier and his ministers to stay on in a caretaker capacity while he takes time to identify a prime minister able to attract sufficient cross-party support to pass legislation.A caretaker government could either propose emergency legislation to roll the tax-and-spend provisions in the 2024 budget into next year, or invoke special powers to pass the draft 2025 budget by decree - though jurists say this is a legal grey area and the political cost would be huge.Macron’s opponents also could vote down one prime minister after the next.ECONOMIC PAINThe upheaval is not without risk for Le Pen.Macron allies sought to present her as an agent of chaos after her party joined forces with the left to down Barnier.“The French will harshly judge the choice you are going to make,” Laurent Wauquiez, a lawmaker from the conservative Les Republicains party who backs Macron, told Le Pen in parliament.Since Macron called the summer snap election, France’s CAC 40 benchmark stock market index has dropped nearly 10% and is the heaviest loser among top EU economies.The euro EUR=EBS showed little immediate reaction versus the dollar, trading for around $1.05 per euro, but dipping against other European currencies, such as the Swiss franc and the pound.“I’m amazed the euro hasn’t moved much,” said Nick Rees, senior foreign exchange market analyst at Monex Europe. “There are two major powers in Europe, France and Germany, both of which right now are emasculated.”Barnier’s draft budget had sought to cut the fiscal deficit from a projected 6% of national output this year to 5% in 2025. Voting down his government would be catastrophic for state finances, he had said.Le Pen shrugged off the warning. She said her party would support any eventual emergency law that rolls over the 2024 budget’s tax-and-spend provisions into next year to ensure there is stopgap financing.

The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise.

Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner.

Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  ","summary":"The US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections.

South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  "},{"hash":"bcb7bd7043864daf8a848637d130c880fcbac215b6bcb0ed1320ffd9a01c115e","title":"tia-s-reduced-flight-hours-could-stall-economic-growth","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/11/08/tia-s-reduced-flight-hours-could-stall-economic-growth","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/money/Untitled1-1731029082.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1731003300000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"How big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist.

The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement.

Still, the party will be far from happy. Nepali Congress candidates had, in 2022 local elections, won 29 of the 44 seats that had later gone vacant due to the deaths of the incumbents and other reasons. In the by-polls to fill these seats, the Congress is in line to win just 17 seats. The Congress won the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, and 16 ward chairs while it had won 29 posts in earlier elections. In the recent by-elections, the Congress had already won the two posts of district coordinating committees in Kailali and Okhaldhunga unopposed as no one filed candidacy against them.Retaining the mayor of Kirtipur has come as a big relief for the party.Both the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), the second and third largest parties in the federal parliament, respectively, have succeeded in adding to the number of their local representatives. Of the vacant seats, each won seven in 2022. Compared to last time, while the UML added three local representatives, the Maoist Centre added two. Congress General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma, who led the party’s by-poll campaign, said the results were different this time as the party contested the by-elections without any alliance. In the previous local polls, it had formed alliances with the Maoist Centre and CPN (Unified Socialist), among other fringe parties. “Although it seems that we lost some posts we had earlier won, the party members are in fact excited about the election results that we achieved with our own strength,” Sharma told the Post. The by-elections were held for one municipal mayor, two rural municipality chairpersons, four vice-chairs, one deputy mayor, and 33 ward chairs. Among these, the Congress had earlier won the post of Mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, and deputy mayor of Nalgad Municipality of Jajarkot.Likewise, it had won Gramthan Rural Municipality chairperson in Morang, Mahabu Rural Municipality chairperson in Dailekh, vice-chairperson of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality, Dolakha, and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Meanwhile, Maoist Centre candidates won vice-chairs in Sarkegad Rural Municipality and Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality. The Congress couldn’t retain at least 10 posts the party earlier won.The Maoists have now snatched away from the Congress Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Nalgad deputy mayor in Jajarkot. Likewise, the UML has won Mahabu Rural Municipality and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality.The UML has managed to retain its seven ward chairpersons but in different local units, and add a chairperson and two vice-chairpersons of rural municipalities. According to the Election Commission, UML candidate Jung Bahadur Shahi has won the post of chairman of Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh.Similarly, Maoist Centre’s Namo Narayan Majhi has won the post of chairman of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang.Maoist Centre’s Devaka Lamichhane has been elected as deputy mayor of Nalgad Rural Municipality in Jajarkot.Likewise, Sulochana Kumari Bhandari of the UML has won the post of Vice-Chairperson of Balmiki Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura. Her nearest rival was Pultisara Shahi of the Congress. Bhandari was earlier defeated by Maina Devi Joshi of the Nepali Congress in the 2022 local elections.The Maoist Centre did well in some places where local by-elections were held. Despite the Congress-UML alliance, the Maoist Centre won the post of vice-chair of Putha Uttarganga in Rukum (East). The Maoist Centre’s candidate Narapura Budha won the post securing 3,627 votes to defeat Kesh Kumari Tulachan of the UML who was backed by the Congress. The UML candidate Tulachan got only 2,128 votes. In the by-polls, the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party (NMKP) candidate won the post of chairperson in ward 4 of Tilagupha Municipality in Kalikot. The party’s Khadgaraj Shahi won the post with 143 votes, defeating Naishoba Shahi of CPN (Maoist Centre), who garnered 115 votes. The post was earlier held by the Maoist Centre. Besides Bhaktapur, the party also has a presence in places like Kalikot, Humla and Dailekh. The party also has ward chairpersons in some places of Dailekh.“Our party played a big role in raising political awareness in places like Kalikot, Humla and Dailekh even during the Panchayat period,” Prem Suwal, the federal lawmaker from the party, told the Post. Among the new parties that emerged in the November 2022 elections, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) won the post of chairperson of ward 16 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC).RSP’s Rojina Shrestha left the candidates of traditional parties behind. The post was earlier held by the Congress. Despite the party’s poor performance in other parts of the country where the by-polls were conducted, Shrestha’s win in KMC-16 marks the party’s debut at the local level. Shrestha secured 2,902 votes against UML’s Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar who garnered 2,220 votes. The Congress candidate Devendra Pathak managed to secure 2,214 votes in the ward.The Maoist Centre had not fielded a candidate in ward 16 of KMC. Asked why the Congress candidate lost, the party’s vice president of Kathmandu unit, Santa Kumar Maharjan, said the ward was never a Congress stronghold.“This was a ward dominated by the UML earlier as well. When all ward members were from the UML, Mukunda Risal was the only candidate to be elected from the Congress. He became the chairperson,” Maharjan said. “Risal’s victory could solely be attributed to his charismatic leadership.”Except the RSP, other new political parties failed to win any seats. The Janamat Party, which has a strong presence in Madhesh Province and currently leads the Madhesh Province government, failed to show its presence at the local level by-polls. In the by-polls held for the post of ward chairperson in seven wards in Madhesh, the Congress and the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal led by Upendra Yadav won two posts each.

Following the meetings, several project agreements and instruments are expected to be signed, officials said.Sun Weidong, vice minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Nepali Ambassador to China Krishna Prasad Oli, and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song, among others, welcomed the Nepali delegation at Beijing Capital International Airport. Oli is leading an 87-member delegation that includes his spouse Radhika Shkaya, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, advisors to the prime minister, members of parliament, senior government officials, and businesspersons, among others.“Prime Minister Oli will hold a meeting with Xi, the president of the People’s Republic of China tomorrow [Tuesday],” said a statement issued by the Nepali Embassy in Beijing on Monday. “On the same day, the prime minister is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Li.”A Cabinet meeting on Sunday approved the prime minister’s visit to China, as well as projects and instruments to be signed during the visit. Besides meeting with the Chinese president and premier, Oli will hold talks with Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and will deliver a keynote address at Peking University. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum, jointly hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), on Wednesday.Sunday’s Cabinet meeting also approved the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the Volunteers’ Chinese Language Teachers’ Programme, according to Minister for Information and Communication Prithivi Subba Gurung, the government spokesman. The MoU will pave the way for Chinese teachers to teach Chinese language in various Nepali schools. Details of the programme, such as the number of Chinese teachers and working modality, will be finalised by the Ministry of Education and its Chinese counterpart, according to a foreign ministry official.China is set to provide a one-time budgetary support of $20 million to Nepal. Another agreement to accept Chinese economic and technical assistance worth 300 million RMB was also endorsed by the Cabinet on Sunday.Observers are closely watching whether the framework for cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be signed during this visit. A revised BRI framework document, prepared by a four-member task force from the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, has already been forwarded to the Chinese side for its consideration. Although Nepal has received positive signals on the revised BRI document, it remains uncertain whether it will be signed during Oli’s visit, a foreign ministry official told the Post before flying to Beijing on Monday.During the visit, according to government spokesperson Gurung, some project-related agreements are also expected to be signed. These include construction of an integrated check post at the Korola border point; Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road; Tokha-Chhahre-Bidur Highway; and an agreement to complete the feasibility study of 220KV Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime cross-border power transmission line.According to Gurung, 0ther agreements include the construction of a friendship bridge in Kimathanka— Khandbari over the Arun river; construction of a multi-functional agriculture park at Chobhar; industrial park at the Korola border point; and agreement on commencing bone marrow transplant at BP Koirala Cancer Hospital. Also, a new development cooperation model for 2024–2028 between Nepal and China is also expected to be signed. During the visit, leaders and officials will engage in finalising the framework for BRI cooperation and some projects to be developed under it. The Nepali side has proposed a dozen projects to be executed under the BRI framework. Multiple officials involved in the negotiations with the Chinese told the Post that Nepal is seeking the release of pending grants announced by China since 2008 and wants to develop select projects.Similarly, an MoU will be signed between Nepal Television and China Media Group, which owns China Central Television (including China Global Television Network), China National Radio, and China Radio International.Some accords and agreements from previous visits including Araniko Highway upgrade, and the second phase of Kathmandu Ring Road expansion are likely to be signed after delegation-level talks between Oli and Li on Tuesday. Chinese assistance, including 100 electric vehicles, vans, and ambulances; and some cross-border infrastructure and connectivity-related projects, will also be discussed and signed during the prime minister’s visit, according to officials.

In the fray are 377 candidates, including independents, according to the commission.The by-polls are set to be held in local units across the seven provinces. The voting began at 7am and will continue till 5pm.Three of the total 44 vacant posts were elected unopposed. Now, one municipal mayor, one deputy mayor, two rural municipality chairpersons, four vice-chairpersons, and 33 ward chairpersons are up for grabs.The district coordination committee candidates in Kailali and Okhaldhunga were elected unopposed from the Nepali Congress. While Tek Raj Bhattarai in Kailali and Tika Kumari Chaudhary in Okhaldhunga of the Congress were unchallenged, CPN (Maoist Centre) candidate Jagat Gharti had no contenders for the Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality ward-2 chairperson post, according to election officials.The commission is conducting voting from 7 am to 5 pm on Sunday at the polling stations set up at respective local units where the seats have gone vacant.Nita Pokharel Aryal, spokesperson for the Election Commission, said that all preparations for the by-polls have been completed.“Special arrangements have been made to give priority to disabled, senior citizens, pregnant women and other people requiring different arrangements to cast their votes,” Aryal said. According to Aryal, those whose names are included in the final voter list can cast their votes showing the original proof of voter identity card, Nepali citizenship certificate, national identity card, passport, driving licence or permanent account number card.Commission officials expect higher voter turnout compared to earlier elections. According to an officer at the commission, the election body analysed some lapses in the past elections and fixed them. “We believe the turnout will be higher this time,” says an official.Counting of votes will begin immediately after the voting is completed, and all the ballot boxes will be collected at the designated counting centres. The commission has said that the count can be followed on its website.The commission plans to announce the final by-election results within two days.“We expect to use a helicopter to collect ballot boxes of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha due to the difficult geography of the village,” Durga Prasad Chalise, the deputy spokesperson for the commission said.“It may take some time to collect ballot boxes in Sarkegad Rural Municipality of Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality of Bajura, but other than that, we will have no problem starting vote counting immediately.”The commission is holding by-elections as per the legal provision. According to the Local Level Election Act-2017, if the position of the district coordination committee chief, deputy chief, rural municipality chairman, vice-chairman, municipality mayor, deputy mayor and ward chair fall vacant for any reason before the end of their term and if more than a year of their term remains, the remaining term will be filled through a by-election.The elections are being held only to elect 41 representatives at local units but political parties have given priority to the by-polls as if it is going to be a test of their strength.Even top politicians such as CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress general secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma and CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, among other influential leaders, were actively involved in election campaigns in favour of their candidates.Some reckon people could express their disenchantment towards traditional parties because of their inability to deliver on governance. But Uddhab Pyakurel, an assistant professor at the Kathmandu University, said the by-elections can’t be seen as a voice of the Nepali people at large.Pyakurel thinks that regular elections are different to by-elections and by-elections results seldom reflect on future election results.Sunday’s by-elections are taking place only for the 41 posts of certain local units. There are 753 local units (276 municipalities and 460 rural municipalities), further divided into 6,743 wards.“So the results of the 41 local contests are insufficient to draw definite conclusions about the future,” Pyakurel said.

His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.

According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN ","summary":"Eminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer.

Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that even though the number of infections from the deadly virus has declined, people are still contracting the disease.“Like in the previous year, we have not expected zero dengue cases in any particular month,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “New cases of dengue infection are still being reported from various districts.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the start of the year and in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons as well.Entomologists say that even if dengue spread slows naturally in the winter, the risk of infection with the deadly virus has not lessened, as the daytime maximum temperature suits virus-spreading vectors to get active.“In summer, Aedes mosquitoes bite people in the morning and evening, but in winter, they become active during the daytime when temperatures rise,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “And we should not forget that even though the growth of the virus-spreading vectors slows down in winter due to cold, it does not stop.”Thirteen people have died, and over 34,000 have been infected since January 2024, according to government data. The virus has spread in all 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often underreport deaths and infections.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be managed with paracetamol at home.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to experts, dengue became endemic in Nepal years ago, meaning that people get infected throughout the year.“New cases could surge once temperatures rise,” said Panta. “Also, the general public should not be complacent, as the risk has not been over. Prevention measures are essential to preventing the spread.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery.

","summary":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"Khokana, a historical village near Kathmandu, balances urban expansion with traditional architecture, featuring stone-paved streets, temples, mustard oil mills, and the Sikali Temple, all accessible via goat trails and offering a glimpse into the medieval era."},{"hash":"a90b9db6c3c38cf48a1d63805bc18a62428b153ecbe76daccdb8010d4b8e3b5d","title":"this-summer-i-saw-the-everest-up-close","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2024/06/23/this-summer-i-saw-the-everest-up-close","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/main-1719107987.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719080100000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” "},{"hash":"7ea85e731597bdeb1671d95bca3078159d53ed7499444aaf8b71b7db12d28349","title":"the-kumari-tradition-lives-on-balancing-ancient-and-modern-values","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/08/01/the-kumari-tradition-lives-on-balancing-ancient-and-modern-values","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/kumari-1722472781.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1722449700000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. ","summary":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

He was to leave abroad for higher education the following day. Likewise, several months ago, a young man expressed his distress over the intense pain following a penicillin injection administered against syphilis disease. When questioned about his marital status, he stated that he only had a girlfriend with whom he maintained a regular consensual sexual relationship. He further mentioned that the sexual interactions were generally unprotected. As per the hospital (STIDH) data, the majority of individuals receiving penicillin injections for syphilis are between 20 and 40 years old, with nearly two-thirds of that group being in the 20 to 30 age range. It’s a surprising but concerning public health concern in Nepal. Unprotected sexual contact not only carries the risk of syphilis but also increases the likelihood of other infectious diseases such as HIV, Mpox (known as “monkeypox”), HPV, gonorrhoea, herpes, chlamydia, trichomoniasis and hepatitis B. Since syphilis does not immediately show severe symptoms, many people do not get tested and thus remain unaware of their infection. There has been a notable rise in youths seeking foreign employment opportunities in recent years. This mandates medical examinations and blood tests, including for sexually transmitted infections/diseases. Following this, information about the spread of syphilis in Nepal has surfaced. People who engage in unprotected sexual activities, especially with more than one partner, have a higher likelihood of contracting syphilis. A bacterium, 'Treponema pallidum', is responsible for the infection. The transmission occurs through vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse as well as during pregnancy and through blood transfusions. Syphilis has four stages. On average, symptoms appear within three weeks of infection. This is referred to as the first stage. Sores may appear on the genitals, vagina, mouth/lips, or anus. As the sores are painless, many do not notice them or tend to overlook them. If treatment is provided around this time, the infection can be prevented from progressing to the second stage. Even without treatment, the sores typically heal within three to six weeks. However, the infection will progress to the second stage. Small rashes can be seen on various body parts (including the palms and soles) a few weeks after the first stage. Since these rashes are not clearly visible or do not cause pain or itching, people usually do not pay attention to them. However, symptoms such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat and fatigue can occur. The infection will enter the next stage, known as the 'latent stage' if left untreated. As per the hospital data, the majority of youths are commonly diagnosed and treated for syphilis during this stage. There are no symptoms in the latent stage; however, the infection can persist in the body for years if left untreated. The disease then progresses to the ‘tertiary stage’. This can occur 10-30 years after the initial infection. In this stage, syphilis can affect or damage vital organs such as the nervous system, eyes, heart and ears. Regrettably, information about complications or deaths due to the “tertiary stage” of syphilis is not well studied/known in Nepal to date. According to research published in the journal BMJ Open in 2024, 94.5 percent of sexually active students were found to have had risky sexual behaviour (RSB) in Kathmandu. Nearly one-third of the participants were found to be engaged with multiple partners. The participants ranged from 18 to 32 years, with a mean age of 21. The study only focused on undergraduate students residing in hostels in Kathmandu. Thus, the prevalence of RSB among Nepali youths might be significantly greater than what the research indicates. There is a pressing need for further research into this issue.There are numerous instances where people’s travel has been halted upon testing positive for syphilis because evidence of “no syphilis” is considered a crucial health requirement in employer health assessments abroad. Although treatment can cure the disease, the markers for syphilis often remain in blood tests. This appears to put young people in a difficult situation, especially financially, as they may have already incurred significant expenses by that time.We cannot ignore the fact that syphilis is spreading at an alarming rate among young adults in Nepal. It can be inferred that having multiple sexual partners and engaging in unsafe sexual practices without proper awareness contributed to the growing prevalence of syphilis among Nepali youths. Establishing an environment that fosters open dialogue and education regarding \"reproductive and sexual health\" among young people could significantly mitigate the challenges of rising syphilis infection in the country.  ","summary":"Recently, a 22-year-old man visited Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) to get his sexually transmitted disease status checked after having unprotected sex.

This is an impossible task given that Nepal's total national budget in actual is barely $10 billion. Unless the government demonstrates its creative resource management ability, our dream of development and prosperity will not even be partially realised.The second glaring challenge is the lack of capacity for resource absorption at the government’s executing units, from federal ministries to ward offices in municipalities.

On December 10 each year, the world comes together to observe International Human Rights Day, a day that underscores the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. First recognised in 1950 under the guidance of the United Nations, this day has evolved into a global call to action for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. Yet, despite decades of progress, violations persist across the globe, reminding us that the fight for human rights is far from over. The debate on human rights dates back centuries, and two of the most prominent figures in this discourse Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine left a lasting legacy that continues to resonate today.Burke, a supporter of the monarchy, saw the preservation of tradition and hierarchy as essential to societal stability, while Paine, a revolutionary thinker, championed liberty, equality, and the rights of individuals. One of Paine’s most famous lines, “We pity the plumage, but forget the dying bird,” directly addressed the hypocrisy of focusing on superficial issues while ignoring the deeper, more urgent concerns. In modern times, these words still carry weight, highlighting how we often address surface-level concerns while systemic injustices persist, unnoticed or unchallenged. The observance of Human Rights Day invites us to reflect on the progress made and the work still to be done. It is a reminder that the principles outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948, remain crucial in shaping a more just and equitable world.However, despite the ground-breaking achievements of the UDHR, widespread violations continue, and the fight for human dignity remains on-going. Throughout history, the struggle for human rights has been a journey fraught with obstacles. One notable turning point in this struggle occurred in the United States during the 19th century. The abolition of slavery, a monumental achievement, came about through the tireless efforts of leaders like Abraham Lincoln, who, in 1863, led the nation to abolish the institution through the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. This was a transformative moment in the history of human rights. Despite the victory, however, African-Americans continued to face systemic discrimination and segregation for many years after.The 1954 landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, where the US Supreme Court declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, was another significant victory for human rights in America. But even after this, African-Americans had to fight for basic rights like access to education, the vote, and an end to discriminatory laws. It was only in 1965, after decades of struggle and advocacy by civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., that African-Americans were granted the right to vote under the Voting Rights Act. These achievements were monumental, but they were hard-won, demonstrating the lengths to which marginalised communities had to go in order to claim their human rights. Internationally, the story of human rights has also been one of continuous struggle and progress.The United Nations’ adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 was a defining moment. It set out, for the first time, a global standard for human rights, affirming the rights of individuals to life, liberty, and security, among other freedoms. The UDHR became the foundation upon which many countries would base their own human rights frameworks. But the road to realising these rights in full has not been easy. Over the decades, the UDHR has been supplemented by two essential covenants—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights—passed in 1966 to reinforce and clarify the rights outlined in the UDHR.One of the key figures behind the development of the UDHR was Eleanor Roosevelt, who, as the chairperson of the UN Human Rights Commission, played a pivotal role in its creation. Known as the “mother of modern human rights,” Roosevelt’s vision for a world where all people were treated equally and with dignity shaped the discourse on human rights for generations. Unfortunately, she did not live to see the full impact of the UDHR, passing away in 1962, but her legacy lives on. Since 1998, the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights has been awarded annually to individuals who have made significant contributions to the protection of human rights. As we reflect on the history of human rights, we must also acknowledge the many challenges that remain today.In the United States, for example, despite significant progress, debates about gun control and mass shootings continue to spark deep divisions. The United Nations and various human rights organisations have called for greater restrictions on firearms, but powerful interest groups like the National Rifle Association (NRA) continue to push back against any form of regulation. The on-going violence in schools and public places is a stark reminder that the struggle for human rights continues, and that the protection of human life and safety is an essential component of human rights. In India, human rights protections are enshrined in the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life, liberty, and equality. However, even in a country with such a strong legal framework, violations of human rights are not uncommon.Discrimination based on caste, religion, gender, and disability continues to affect millions of people across the country. While the Constitution guarantees equal rights for all, the reality often falls short. The National Human Rights Commission, which works to address these issues, plays an important role, but there is still much work to be done. The issue of discrimination remains one of the most pervasive challenges to human rights. Genderbased violence, including domestic abuse, sexual assault, and trafficking, continues to devastate the lives of women and girls around the world. In many countries, LGBTQ+ individuals face violence, discrimination, and the denial of basic rights.Refugees and migrants, fleeing war, persecution, and poverty, are often subjected to inhumane conditions and denied their rights to safety and protection. The most vulnerable members of society, including those who are stateless, face some of the most extreme forms of discrimination, and the international community must do more to protect them. On a global scale, poverty and inequality are also significant barriers to realising human rights. Despite progress in some areas, the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen. Economic inequalities, along with the challenges posed by climate change, pose major threats to the realisation of human rights for millions of people around the world. The struggle for human rights is far from over.While progress has been made, there are still millions of people around the world who are denied their basic rights and dignity. The world must come together to address the root causes of discrimination, inequality, and violence. Human rights are not just abstract concepts; they are the foundation of a just and peaceful world. As we observe International Human Rights Day later this month, we must renew our commitment to these principles and work to ensure that they are upheld for all people, everywhere.The fight for human rights is not just the responsibility of governments or international organisations. It is a responsibility shared by all of us, whether through advocacy, education, or simply standing up for justice. We must remember the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, “Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home.” It is in our homes, our communities, and our everyday actions that the future of human rights will be determined.—The Statesman (India)/ANN ","summary":"Once, human rights were understood as the simple principle that one person’s rights should never extend beyond the tip of another’s nose unless invited. On December 10 each year, the world comes together to observe International Human Rights Day, a day that underscores the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. First recognised in 1950 under the guidance of the United Nations, this day has evolved into a global call to action for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. Yet, despite decades of progress, violations persist across the globe, reminding us that the fight for human rights is far from over. The debate on human rights dates back centuries, and two of the most prominent figures in this discourse Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine left a lasting legacy that continues to resonate today.Burke, a supporter of the monarchy, saw the preservation of tradition and hierarchy as essential to societal stability, while Paine, a revolutionary thinker, championed liberty, equality, and the rights of individuals. One of Paine’s most famous lines, “We pity the plumage, but forget the dying bird,” directly addressed the hypocrisy of focusing on superficial issues while ignoring the deeper, more urgent concerns. In modern times, these words still carry weight, highlighting how we often address surface-level concerns while systemic injustices persist, unnoticed or unchallenged. The observance of Human Rights Day invites us to reflect on the progress made and the work still to be done.

Nepali cricket fanbase, who grew up watching the Indian Premier League, are now ecstatic to have their own truly international franchise league comprising no less than eight teams. The fact that people from different parts of the country are travelling to the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground to cheer on their favourite teams speaks volumes about the tournament’s mass appeal.The ‘Festival of Himalayas’ features big cricketing names like former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham, Dutch Michael Levitt, Namibia’s Gerhard Erasmus, and Australia’s Ben Cutting. Nepali cricketers—both national players and newcomers—will now get to rub shoulders with these global cricket superstars, which will greatly boost their confidence. The NPL will also hopefully offer these players enough financial incentives to pursue cricket as a profession. In fact, the recent all-format international success of the Indian national team is often attributed to the IPL, for some of the same reasons. The start of the NPL this year could thus mark a sea-change in Nepal’s success in international cricket. The league will have a global audience after getting the Star Sports Network, an internationally established TV network, as the official broadcaster; and after partnering with the Twenty-first Century Media Sports, a company that has managed many international events. They will help showcase Nepal as a global cricket destination. No wonder Nepali cricket fans are upbeat. As one fan placard during Saturday’s opening match between Janakpur Bolts and Biratnagar Kings put it: “No matter who wins it is the victory of Nepali cricket.”Done well, the NPL’s success will resonate much beyond the international sports scene. The vast majority of Nepali youths are looking to leave the country the first opportunity they get. They see no hope in their country. But when they see that cricketers and commentators and organisers from around the world are coming to their homeland to play as professionals, perhaps this feeling of disenchantment with their native country will go down a bit. Additionally, if Nepal can successfully pull off an international tournament like the NPL, there is no reason this welcoming country cannot host tournaments like the cricket Asia Cup. But there will also be challenges. The Cricket Association of Nepal has taken up the monumental task of organising an eight-team tournament. The association’s history of managing similar tournaments is checkered. For instance, the CAN-organised Nepal T20 League in 2022-23 was marred by controversies even before it kicked off due to allegations about match-fixing. The body has also faced criticisms for negligence, delayed payments and incompetence. Even in the opening match of the NPL on Saturday, the association failed to manage the crowd, which in turn led to injuries. The next day, fans were seen running on to the cricket pitch at the completion of a match. In order to maintain the integrity of Nepali cricket, it is vital to minimise such incidents. Hopefully, the CAN is learning with every match. The CAN must get the NPL right, for the tournament’s benefits are potentially limitless. The millions of international TV viewers of the NPL will get to see what a beautiful country Nepal is and this in turn could boost the country’s tourism prospects. The NPL itself, linked to a multitude of stakeholders, can create many profitable jobs, especially as other stadiums are built and the tournament expands to other parts of Nepal.

At the centre of the debate is an argument over whether Nepal should accept only grants to develop bilateral Nepal-China projects or such projects can also be built with loans. In the end, the two main ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—decided that there would be no loan deals during Oli’s China trip. The Congress had been adamant that Nepal cannot afford any more loans and as such there was no question of adding a financial burden to the country. As things stand, 12 projects are lined up for signing. An agreement on the ‘BRI framework for cooperation’ is also likely, which, at least in theory, should add momentum to old and new bilateral projects. There are multiple readings of the two ruling parties’ disagreements on negotiating with the Chinese. In one, the Congress, as the biggest ruling party, played a dubious role by unnecessarily tying the prime minister’s hands before an important visit.Oli, in this reading, won’t have much to show at the end of the trip. Yet there can be an alternate and more charitable reading of the recent sequence of events—and one which will be more salubrious to the country’s interests. The BRI became so controversial on the eve of Oli’s China trip precisely because there was lack of clarity on what being a part of it entailed for Nepal. When the country signed up to the initiative’s framework agreement back in 2017, there was little debate even as grey areas galore. For instance, the document Nepal signed seven years ago is yet to be made public, fanning many speculations. In this context, the new debate on the kind of cooperation the country can expect under the BRI was much needed. Unlike in the past when they were querulous opponents, this time, as coalition partners, the Congress and the UML were forced to come to an understanding on the initiative. They did this through a four-member taskforce that carefully dissected the new China-proposed framework. The Nepali side has tweaked the new BRI framework document in line with the suggestions of the taskforce and sent it back to China for final approval. Nepal has long felt the need for a broad political understanding on vital foreign policy issues. Yet such an understanding has invariably been made a victim to top leaders’ never-ending jockeying for power. This time, the differences between the Congress and the UML over the BRI, and the wider debate it sparked, have helped the country arrive at a more nuanced position on how to engage with China, one of Nepal’s two most important foreign friends.

The sum of these understandings can in turn form a solid basis for a more consensus based Nepali foreign policy. Perhaps this extrapolation is a little simplistic.

According to the United Nations, one in three women globally experiences physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. The reality is dire in Nepal too. The Demographic Health Survey 2022 reveals that one in three Nepali women aged 15-49 has experienced some form of violence. Further, with the rise of technology, women have been experiencing harassment, non-consensual sexting, hate and fear in online spaces. The unresolved and harrowing rape-and-murder of Nirmala Panta is an example of the pervasive and enduring nature of GBV in Nepal.Campaigns and activism hold great promise to challenge and confront the violence women face. In Nepal, the government, non-profit organisations and international agencies join hands to discuss the issues of women and find practical solutions. Yet their actions are mostly urban-centric, with rallies and programmes not reaching the grassroots level. For countless Nepali women in rural areas who face multiple layers of marginalisation, these 16 days offer little in terms of solace or change. Words don’t translate into actions even as their issues get the centre stage. Apparently, despite having abundant legal frameworks against GBV, Nepal ranks 71 out of 190 economies in the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law Safety indicator, which focuses on four key areas: child marriage, sexual harassment, domestic violence and femicide. The UN’s report “Femicides in 2023” states that “home is the most dangerous place for women”. Nepal is no exception, as out of 21,568 cases of violence against women reported between July 2021 and July 2022, 80 percent were related to domestic violence. And intimate partner violence—a subset of domestic violence—remains the most challenging issue to tackle. Meanwhile, with the rise of artificial intelligence, deepfakes of women have become common. Our outdated cyber laws fail to cover new threats against women and leave them ever-vulnerable in online spaces; Nepal remains far behind in addressing technology-facilitated gender violence. While this slow progress is partly due to the enduring severity of domestic and intimate partner violence, which demands significant attention and resources from the government and other stakeholders, it would be dangerous to overlook online forms of violence against women. For women going through physical and mental trauma brought about by various forms of violence, no lofty words pronounced at forums offer relief. Addressing such pervasive issues needs practical actions like making them capable enough to recognise and resist domestic violence. It is also vital to goad survivors to break silence about the abuse they face, as according to the 2022 health survey, 58 percent of women who experience physical and sexual violence don’t seek support or speak up. If they did speak up, it would be much easier for police and other authorities to intervene and help. Yet more can be done. Alongside designated days to counter violence against women, as many women’s rights activists emphasise, there should also be year-round advocacy on GBV. Sensitising men about violence against women and bringing—and enacting—stringent laws to dismantle the evolving structures that perpetuate gender-based violence are the bare minimum needed to build safe spaces for women.

So was the case with rehabilitation centers and other organizations, it was mentioned.\nSome new buildings had lift and ramp for wheel-chairs, the PWD could not have the surety of easily accessing the restrooms, bathroom and canteens in those buildings, the report highlighted.\nFurthermore, the report brought to the fore the grave issue of PWD’s rights to attending to their basic needs such as food, clean drinking water and comfortable accommodation facilities was being neglected.\nAlso, there is a scarcity of skilled human resources such as psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and social mobilizers among others in the Bagmati and Gandaki Provinces for the PWD, the report noted.\nThe National Health Insurance Program also appears to be ineffective for the people with mental health issues or psychological disabilities as their access to it was limited, it was reported.\nCommission’s Chairperson Tap Bahadur Magar shared that the research and study attempted to examine or identify the quality of treatment, care and support mechanism for the people with mental problems and psychological disabilities.\nIt is stated that widespread differences were seen from the perspective of sanitation at the organizations and rehabilitation centres visited in course of the study.\nThe study showed that in some organizations the sanitation standard was found to be good while it was average in some others. It is stated that most of the organizations have not really paid attention to the topic of confidentiality.\nThe study report stated that several of the private hospitals lacked disabled-friendly toilets.\nThe study mentioned that people with mental issues and those with psycho-social debility had limited access to quality mental health services in Gandaki Province which has a dominant rural population as compared to Bagmati province.\nNHRC Chairperson Magar said the study has tried to identify the quality of treatment, care and support that people with mental issues and those with psycho-social debility have.\n“The study has recommended to the government and the stakeholder bodies to ensure the rights of people with psycho-social disabilities and to promote their mental health and wellbeing,” he said.\nDr Krishna Poudel, Head of the Ministry of Health and Population’s Policy, Planning and Monitoring Division, said that the Ministry has not been able to extend services of psychiatric doctors and specialists in remote areas including in the Sudurpaschim Province.\n“A lot of work has to be carried out with minimum resources.

Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape in South Asia, this visit has the potential to redefine Nepal-China relations. However, it is equally important for Nepal to maintain its balanced foreign policy, ensuring that strengthening ties with China does not overshadow its unique and historically significant relationship with India. This state visit to China holds immense promise but also requires careful navigation to avoid the perception that Nepal is aligning slightly with China. Nepal shares with India not only an open border but also deep cultural and historical bonds.\nReluctant India and Prompt China:\nIndian authorities have expressed a preference for Nepal’s Prime Ministers to make start of their foreign visit from India. While this tradition stems from the open border, economic, trade, political, and cultural ties between the two countries, there is no political obligation for this practice. India has traditionally invited Nepal’s new Prime Ministers for a state visit either with congratulations shortly after the formation of new government or within the early hundred days of their tenure. However, this time, no such invitation was extended.\nPrime Minister Oli has already extended invitation to Indian Prime Minister Modi on two separate occasions- first on August 11, during a courtesy meeting, through Indian Foreign Ministry Secretary Vikram Misri and later during a personal meeting with Prime Minister Modi in New York. Although Prime Minister Modi graciously accepted the invitations, a reciprocal invitation for PM Oli’s state visit to India was not issued Iit seems that Modi may have reservations about extending an invitation to new Prime Minister Oli for a state visit to India.  However, India’s delay in extending an invitation raises questions about whether India feels uneasy or strained in its relations with the current coalition government in Nepal. In the absence of an invitation from India, China extended a state visit invitation to Prime Minister Oli, which he accepted, reflecting Nepal’s active engagement in fostering bilateral ties with its northern neighbor. Had an invitation from India been received earlier, obviously, PM Oli’s first state visit would have been to India, in line with past practices. China’s prompt invitation led to the decision for a visit to Beijing first, followed by a visit to Delhi once India extends its invitation. This approach reflects Nepal’s commitment to maintaining balanced relations with its neighbors. So, viewing the visit to the northern neighbor, China, through the lens of Nepal-India relations is superfluous. While the delay in India’s invitation may have led to perceptions of a diplomatic pause, Nepal remains committed to its non-aligned foreign policy. It is vital that this visit to China highlights Nepal’s balanced approach to nurturing strong, cooperative, and equitable relationships with both its northern and southern neighbors.The preparations for a visit to neighboring countries by the Prime Minister of Nepal, an independent and sovereign nation, should be viewed as normal.\n \nNepal’s Dilemma Between MCC and BRI:\nNepal finds itself in a complex diplomatic terrain as it needs to maintain balance relationships with global powers like the United States, India, and China. Despite public resistance, the U.S.-backed Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact was passed through Nepal’s Parliament in 2022 and has reached the implementation stage. In contrast, the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), officially endorsed alongside MCC in 2017, remains stalled, raising concerns about Nepal’s diplomatic equilibrium. Both initiatives were officially endorsed by Nepal in 2017, but the disparity in their progression has sparked debate and tension in Nepal’s foreign policy. India’s and America’s subtle resistance to Nepal’s involvement in the BRI reflects their geopolitical concern to discourage Nepal from advancing BRI projects so as to lessen expanding Chinese influence in the region.  Nepal’s hesitation to engage fully with the BRI may be perceived as favoring one global bloc over the other. To maintain non-aligned foreign policy and uphold strong, balanced relationships with all partners, Nepal must move forward with projects under the BRI, ensuring equitable engagement with both Western and Chinese-led initiatives.\nAmid this backdrop, Prime Minister Oli’s visit to China offers an opportunity to recalibrate Nepal’s foreign policy and strengthen its bilateral relations with its northern neighbor. The visit should focus on addressing Nepal’s commitment to the BRI and exploring avenues for equitable collaboration, ensuring that Nepal’s ties with China are as smooth as those with the U.S. and India. Besides, this visit must provide an opportunity to explore how Nepal can maximize benefits from this initiative while ensuring financial and strategic confidence. By taking decisive steps during this visit, PM Oli can reinforce Nepal’s role as a neutral actor, maintain geopolitical balance, and uphold its non-aligned foreign policy amidst growing global competition. This state visit should focus on utilizing opportunities to strengthen Nepal’s neutral and sovereign stance. It should uphold Nepal’s non-aligned foreign policy. The visit must address the aspirations of both Western and Chinese partners. This approach will help mitigate upheavals in Nepal’s diplomatic relations and reaffirm its commitment to a balanced foreign policy.\nChina’s support under the BRI has the potential to transform Nepal’s infrastructure landscape. Projects such as the ambitious Kerung-Kathmandu railway, the modernization of the Arniko Highway, and the development of border dry ports are to be prioritized as critical components of Nepal’s economic aspirations.\nNepal’s Cautious Position on BRI Financing:\nPM Oli is expected to prioritize securing cautious and favorable financing terms for BRI projects, focusing on grants or soft loans with low interest rates with flexible repayment options. Since Nepal has already been borrowing loans from institutions like the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and EXIM Bank, lower-interest loans under the BRI framework would remain competitive. However, Nepal must remain cautious, learning from the debt challenges faced by Sri Lanka and Pakistan in similar projects and must avoid pitfalls experienced by these nations. By insisting on feasibility studies, cost-benefit analyses, and transparent terms, Nepal can ensure successful projects while protecting its economic sovereignty and long-term interests.\nRevitalizing the Airports for Economic Growth:\nNepal’s aviation infrastructure has seen significant contributions from China, particularly through soft loans. Major airports such as Gautam Buddha International Airport in Lumbini and Pokhara International Airport are notable examples of Chinese-backed projects. However, these airports have faced challenges in operating at full capacity. For instance, Gautam Buddha International Airport, despite its potential to serve as a gateway for Buddhist tourism, struggles with low passenger numbers and inadequate connectivity. Similarly, Pokhara International Airport, inaugurated with high expectations, has yet to attract sufficient international airlines. The underutilization of these airports raises concerns about their ability to generate revenue and repay loans. China has operated some chartered flights at Pokhara Airport, and there have been requests for regular flights, but none are currently operational. With no international flights at the airport, domestic flights alone are insufficient to manage the debt. This visit is expected to result in tangible progress toward alleviating the airport’s financial burden. If efforts to secure a waiver for the nearly 28 billion loans taken from China for the airport’s construction are successful, it would be a significant achievement. If China refuses, citing precedents with other countries, an alternative could be debt relief through grant funding.\nBoosting Tourism and Herbal Production:\nChina is an important market for Nepal’s tourism industry. During PM Oli’s visit, discussions on boosting tourism cooperation could yield significant benefits. Simplifying visa procedures for Chinese tourists, increasing direct flights between major cities, and launching joint promotional campaigns could attract more visitors from China. Additionally, promoting Buddhist heritage sites such as Lumbini as part of cultural tourism circuits can appeal to Chinese tourists interested in Buddhism.\nBeyond tourism, Nepal’s rich biodiversity offers immense potential for collaboration in herbal production. Nepal is home to a wide range of medicinal plants, many of which are in high demand in China’s traditional medicine industry. By partnering with China, Nepal can develop its herbal production and processing capabilities. Establishing joint ventures, setting up research and development centers, and creating export-oriented value chains can transform Nepal’s herbal industry into a significant contributor to its economy. This visit is anticipated to comprehensively address these pressing and significant issues, offering potential solutions and fostering deeper collaboration between China and Nepal.\n Cross-Border Infrastructure:\nPM Oli’s visit is also expected to focus on advancing cross-border infrastructure development, which could transform Nepal’s geographical limitations into a strategic advantage. A key project in this vision is the Kerung-Kathmandu railway, a crucial initiative to connect Nepal’s capital with the Chinese border town of Kerung. This railway could revolutionize trade, tourism, and investment, cutting transportation costs and time. Alongside the railway, upgrading the Arniko Highway and modernizing dry ports like Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi will be essential to enhance trade connectivity with China. Securing financial and technical support from China will be pivotal in realizing these ambitious infrastructure goals, positioning Nepal as a vital trade corridor between China and South Asia. PM Oli’s government must emphasize Nepal’s sovereign and non-aligned foreign policy, which prioritizes national interest above external pressures.\nConclusion: Balanced Ties, Bright Future:\nPM Oli’s government must emphasize Nepal’s sovereign and non-aligned foreign policy, which prioritizes national interest above external pressures. Although tradition dictates that Nepal’s Prime Minister typically makes India the first destination for a state visit, PM Oli’s decision to visit China first marks a significant departure from this norm. This break with tradition highlights Nepal’s sovereignty and independence, reaffirming the country’s long-standing history of maintaining its autonomy and making diplomatic decisions based on its own interests. The move underscores Nepal’s commitment to a balanced foreign policy and reflects its ability to chart its own course in the evolving geopolitical landscape, free from external pressures. By adopting a pragmatic and balanced approach, PM Oli’s visit to China should help position Nepal as a key hub of connectivity and economic activity in South Asia. This engagement with China could mark a new era of progress, prosperity, and balanced international relations for Nepal.\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t","summary":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s scheduled state visit to China from December 2 to December 6 stands as an important turning point in Nepal’s diplomatic and developmental strategy.

However, these airports have faced challenges in operating at full capacity. For instance, Gautam Buddha International Airport, despite its potential to serve as a gateway for Buddhist tourism, struggles with low passenger numbers and inadequate connectivity. Similarly, Pokhara International Airport, inaugurated with high expectations, has yet to attract sufficient international airlines. The underutilization of these airports raises concerns about their ability to generate revenue and repay loans. China has operated some chartered flights at Pokhara Airport, and there have been requests for regular flights, but none are currently operational. With no international flights at the airport, domestic flights alone are insufficient to manage the debt. This visit is expected to result in tangible progress toward alleviating the airport’s financial burden. If efforts to secure a waiver for the nearly 28 billion loans taken from China for the airport’s construction are successful, it would be a significant achievement. If China refuses, citing precedents with other countries, an alternative could be debt relief through grant funding.\nBoosting Tourism and Herbal Production:\nChina is an important market for Nepal’s tourism industry. During PM Oli’s visit, discussions on boosting tourism cooperation could yield significant benefits. Simplifying visa procedures for Chinese tourists, increasing direct flights between major cities, and launching joint promotional campaigns could attract more visitors from China. Additionally, promoting Buddhist heritage sites such as Lumbini as part of cultural tourism circuits can appeal to Chinese tourists interested in Buddhism.\nBeyond tourism, Nepal’s rich biodiversity offers immense potential for collaboration in herbal production. Nepal is home to a wide range of medicinal plants, many of which are in high demand in China’s traditional medicine industry. By partnering with China, Nepal can develop its herbal production and processing capabilities. Establishing joint ventures, setting up research and development centers, and creating export-oriented value chains can transform Nepal’s herbal industry into a significant contributor to its economy. This visit is anticipated to comprehensively address these pressing and significant issues, offering potential solutions and fostering deeper collaboration between China and Nepal.\n Cross-Border Infrastructure:\nPM Oli’s visit is also expected to focus on advancing cross-border infrastructure development, which could transform Nepal’s geographical limitations into a strategic advantage. A key project in this vision is the Kerung-Kathmandu railway, a crucial initiative to connect Nepal’s capital with the Chinese border town of Kerung. This railway could revolutionize trade, tourism, and investment, cutting transportation costs and time. Alongside the railway, upgrading the Arniko Highway and modernizing dry ports like Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi will be essential to enhance trade connectivity with China. Securing financial and technical support from China will be pivotal in realizing these ambitious infrastructure goals, positioning Nepal as a vital trade corridor between China and South Asia. PM Oli’s government must emphasize Nepal’s sovereign and non-aligned foreign policy, which prioritizes national interest above external pressures.\nConclusion: Balanced Ties, Bright Future:\nPM Oli’s government must emphasize Nepal’s sovereign and non-aligned foreign policy, which prioritizes national interest above external pressures. Although tradition dictates that Nepal’s Prime Minister typically makes India the first destination for a state visit, PM Oli’s decision to visit China first marks a significant departure from this norm. This break with tradition highlights Nepal’s sovereignty and independence, reaffirming the country’s long-standing history of maintaining its autonomy and making diplomatic decisions based on its own interests. The move underscores Nepal’s commitment to a balanced foreign policy and reflects its ability to chart its own course in the evolving geopolitical landscape, free from external pressures. By adopting a pragmatic and balanced approach, PM Oli’s visit to China should help position Nepal as a key hub of connectivity and economic activity in South Asia. This engagement with China could mark a new era of progress, prosperity, and balanced international relations for Nepal.\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"hash":"f87485a0ed765d71e5eff4c0420cbb8424c2396131d4340f54d285bb154780fa","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBibaha Panchami festival kicks off in Janakpur from today\t\t\t\t\t","date":"December 1, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","source":"np","link":"https://english.nepalpress.com/2024/12/01/bibaha-panchami-festival-kicks-off-in-janakpur-from-today/","imageLink":"https://english.nepalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bibaha-Panchami-festival-1.jpg","category":null,"content":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDHANUSHA: The week-long Bibaha Panchami festival has ritually kicked off from today.\nThe festival that commemorates the union of Princess Sita and Lord Ram in Treta Yug (Vedic era) is celebrated with gaiety and religious fervor in Dhanushadham in Janakpur.\nThe festival is observed on the fifth day of Shukla Paksha (waxing moon) in the Nepali month of Mangshir as per the lunar calendar.\nThis year, the main day of Bibaha Panchami is on December 6.\nOn the first day of the festival, Nagar Darshan (Town visit) ritual is scheduled.\nPart of the celebration includes two children dressed as Ram and his brother Laxman parading around the ancient Janaki Temple, according to Ramroshan Das Baisnav, Sahayak Mahanta (assistant priest) of the Janaki Temple.\nSecond day is known as Phulbari Leela and is marked by dance performances and colorful processions.\nOn the third day is Dhanusha Yagya followed by Tilakotsav on the fourth day.\nThe fifth day is celebrated as Matkor and the final day is Ram Sita Swoyambar, the engagement day.\nNext day, the visitors comprising saints and religious leaders from nearby Indian cities including Ayodhya arriving at Janakpurdham to attend the re-enacting of the Ram Sita Swoyambar during the Bibaha Panchami festival are bade farewell marking the end of the festival.\nThe people from different religious faiths such as Buddhism, Sikhism and Christianity also come to observe the celebration while the Hindu religious leaders and devotees participate in the rituals in large numbers.\nDuring the festival, Ram and Sita are worshipped and homage is paid to the divine couple.

Having earned his academic degrees from Nepal and Japan, he has collaborated with other coauthors to write research articles on sloth bear. He was the lead author of the research article titled ‘Habitat occupancy of sloth bear Melursus ursinus in ChitwanNational Park, Nepal’ which was published in Ecology and Evolution journal’s March 2022 issue. Talking to Birat Anupam of Nepal Press, Rajan Prasad Paudel has shared his academic and experimental insights on sloth bears of Nepal and around.\nAmong the various types of bears found in Nepal, you picked sloth bear from Nepal’s southern plains. Why so? \nI was unaware of bears in Nepal for a long time until I started my studies and work in biodiversity research and conservation. During my entire undergraduate and graduate studies, all I learned was about tigers, rhinos, and leopards. I learned how Nepal is a leading example in their preservation, how kings turned from poachers into conservationists, established rhino sanctuaries, and used hunting tigers and rhinos as a diplomatic tool to safeguard their state and their power. Our textbooks, articles, and news are about charismatic species, which many consider cute and attractive. Only when I started my professional work life did I begin to explore more wildlife. I discovered news that while the world focused and rejoiced in recovering the giant panda in China, other carnivore species were declining, and the focus on single-species conservation was insufficient to protect the other associated species’ communities and ecosystems. I was wondering if the same was happening with wildlife in Nepal. While we focus on conserving Tigers in Terai and Him Chituwa in the Himalayas, we might be slowly losing other carnivores like hyena, dholes and small cats and bears.\nAt NTNC, my supervisor, Dr. Naresh Subedi, introduced me to Prof. Tsubota from Japan, who was working on bears. Relatively, there were more groups and researchers working on species other than bears. It provided me with a unique opportunity to explore this species. Asiatic black bears and brown bears were more common in Europe and America, while sloth bears were rare and endemic to the Indian sub-continent and Sri Lanka. Besides this, a few studies were already ongoing on Asiatic black bears. Brown bears in Nepal were only seasonally seen as they stayed in Tibet most of the time. Further, Chure and Terai landscapes were more related to my upbringing, and I was more comfortable working in these landscapes. So I decided to work on sloth bears and  was fortunate enough to receive a MEXT scholarship from the Japanese government to complete my Ph.D.\nSloth bears dwell around Chitwan, Parsa and Bardiya national parks. What sorts of conservation works are going on to their conservation? \nCamera trapping and sign surveys are periodically being carried out in the park, which gives updates on the distribution of bears. This is vital by-catch information for bear conservation. Various conservation actions are being carried out, such as grassland management, but we do not have adequate information if these actions are benefitting bears or harming them. Awareness programs on human-wildlife conflict prevention are being carried out that address the sloth bear issues to some extent. Sloth bear-specific conservation actions are very rare. The conservation of sloth bears is incidental to the preservation of tigers and rhinos. Our conservation actions and priorities have not shifted much in the grounds.\nSloth bears endangered animal. What are the natural and human factors for this? \nGlobally and nationally, the population and its habitats are shrinking, which is the leading cause for its vulnerability. The major anthropogenic causes are habitat loss due to the expansion of agriculture, settlement, and developmental infrastructures. Sloth bears are the topmost species facing the greatest road expansion impact in South Asia. The capture of bear cubs and brutal training by tribal communities to use them as dancing bears for street entertainment used to be one of the major threats. Still, bears are killed for their bile, and there are other superstitions related to bears and their parts consumption that trigger poaching. Further, humans frequently enter the forests to collect wild fruits, honey, and other forest resources that disturb sloth bear habitat.\nSloth bears have existed in small and isolated patches. Continuous breeding among related individuals leads to the deterioration of genetic health, ultimately contributing to a decline in their fitness to survive. Sloth bear habitat across their range is experiencing changing land use, land cover, and climate. With changing temperature and precipitation regimes, vegetation structure and composition change, and plants and insects shift their distribution range, directly impacting sloth bears. Changing water tables, decreasing grassland habitats, and increasing invasive species may also impact sloth bears. Tigers are the only potential predators of sloth bears. An increase in the tiger population across their distribution range may have caused a decline in the sloth bear population.\nTermite, honey and wild fruits are major foods for sloth bears. It doesn’t eat meat by hunting. Still, there are reports of bear-human conflicts. Why such events are occurring? \nUnlike other omnivore bears, sloth bears have more insectivorous and seasonally frugivores. They do not kill to eat meat, but still, the conflict is occurring. We should be clear that in most cases (except some man-eater tigers), animals do not consider humans as natural prey, and they do not intend to kill or attack unless they feel threatened and feel the need to defend themselves.\nThe majority of human-sloth bear conflicts result in serious or minor injury to humans involved. These conflicts occur because many humans living around the park frequently visit the park for collection of forest resources, during which sudden encounters with bears lead to injuries and fatalities. Human casualties are the dominant form of human-sloth bear conflict, accounting for more than 95% of all recorded conflict cases. Livestock loss accounted for less than 5 % of the total cases of human-sloth bear conflict in Chitwan.\nMost conflicts with sloth bears occur when people are not alert enough and are engaged in activities like collecting wild vegetables, fodder, and fuelwood. Attacks occur due to poor visibility and high shrub cover along forest paths. Another reason is that sloth bears are naturally aggressive, and their aggressiveness increases during their reproduction and when females have cubs. The majority of attacks occur when a female tries to defend their cubs. Many victims (>60%) say that when the bear attacked them, they saw more than one bear in the area. As habitats have become fragmented and the population around parks is increasing, there are frequent encounters between bears and humans. Since there are no strict fences or boundaries between the park and human agriculture, land bears often venture outside of the park boundary. The migration of youth and the increasing trend of leaving barren lands may have further facilitated the movement of bears outside their core area and increased the chances of encounters and conflicts.\nSloth bears are found in Nepal, India and Sri Lanka. However, in the global discourse of sloth bear, India is mentioned most of the time. Why so? \nPioneer academic research and information on sloth ecology and behavior ear was done in Nepal in the late 70s by Laurie and Seidensticker and in the late 90s by Joshi and Garshelis. Many authors acknowledge this information on sloth bears from Nepal. However, there have been very few follow-up studies in Nepal compared to India. The media covered Sloth bears, and their appearance in the jungle book as Baloo popularized it as a product of India. Further, many sloth bears kept in zoos outside have been taken from India, popularizing it as occurring in India. Sloth bears were first described from India, and most of the distribution range and population is in India. In addition, this may also be driven by the strong scientific institutions backed up by India’s high political and economic influencing status.\nSloth bear carries baby in its back for almost seven to nine months something akin to kangaroo. Female sloth bear expecting baby stays in cave. Sloth bear doesn’t have teeth in its front. Besides, what are the other interesting features of sloth bears? \nIndeed, if we look closely at nature, we will see many fascinating and unique things. Generally, all the bear species are considered omnivores, but sloth bears have a unique feeding habit. It’s fascinating to know that the giant body of sloth bears results from consuming tiny little insects, mostly termites and ants. My study found that 90% of its diet comprises termites and ants. How many numbers of termites and ants would a bear consume in a month, can you imagine? Their nose has few hairs and it can open and close the nostrils as needed to help keep the insects crawling up inside the nose while slurping the ants and termites. Other than insects, they love to eat wild fruits. They are said to get intoxicated by consuming fruits like Mauha, similar to that of African elephants getting drunk by feeding on Marula fruits. They do not hunt to eat meat as other carnivores like tigers or leopards. But there was an interesting case of a sloth bear killing around 90 goats in Madi Valley, Chitwan. Such behavior is rare. A few times sloth bears are reported to consume carrion left by other predators. They are very good climbers and love to eat honey. Infantiside is often common in bears, and reported for sloth bears.\nSloth bear has average age of 40 and average weight of 80. Few months ago, while talking to journalists at Sauraha of Chitwan, you had talked about tourism potential of sloth bear in Nepal something similar to what Australia is doing from Kangaroo. How can we add tourism value to the sloth bear? \nThe Australian government is very strict about preserving its native flora and fauna. Kangaroos and koalas are very popular and promoted as symbols of Australia. The distribution, habitat, and behaviors of these species have been very well understood, and their unique features have been promoted in the tourism industry. Tourists can go on a Kangaroo safari, walk in the bushes to see Kangaroos or visit parks, rescue centers, and zoos where they have been kept in almost natural habitats. Sloth Bear provides a similar avenue for reaping benefits from nature-based tourism. Hotspots of sloth bear movements and den sites should be identified, and sloth bear trails should be located. Nature guides and tourism entrepreneurs should promote sloth bear viewing, walking, tracking, and other innovative ideas as tourism products. I have seen tourists satisfied after viewing sloth bears, even if they have not seen other wildlife.

Having earned his academic degrees from Nepal and Japan, he has collaborated with other coauthors to write research articles on sloth bear. He was the lead author of the research article titled ‘Habitat occupancy of sloth bear Melursus ursinus in ChitwanNational Park, Nepal’ which was published in Ecology and Evolution journal’s March 2022 issue. Talking to Birat Anupam of Nepal Press, Rajan Prasad Paudel has shared his academic and experimental insights on sloth bears of Nepal and around.\nAmong the various types of bears found in Nepal, you picked sloth bear from Nepal’s southern plains. Why so? \nI was unaware of bears in Nepal for a long time until I started my studies and work in biodiversity research and conservation. During my entire undergraduate and graduate studies, all I learned was about tigers, rhinos, and leopards. I learned how Nepal is a leading example in their preservation, how kings turned from poachers into conservationists, established rhino sanctuaries, and used hunting tigers and rhinos as a diplomatic tool to safeguard their state and their power. Our textbooks, articles, and news are about charismatic species, which many consider cute and attractive. Only when I started my professional work life did I begin to explore more wildlife. I discovered news that while the world focused and rejoiced in recovering the giant panda in China, other carnivore species were declining, and the focus on single-species conservation was insufficient to protect the other associated species’ communities and ecosystems. I was wondering if the same was happening with wildlife in Nepal. While we focus on conserving Tigers in Terai and Him Chituwa in the Himalayas, we might be slowly losing other carnivores like hyena, dholes and small cats and bears.\nAt NTNC, my supervisor, Dr. Naresh Subedi, introduced me to Prof. Tsubota from Japan, who was working on bears. Relatively, there were more groups and researchers working on species other than bears. It provided me with a unique opportunity to explore this species. Asiatic black bears and brown bears were more common in Europe and America, while sloth bears were rare and endemic to the Indian sub-continent and Sri Lanka. Besides this, a few studies were already ongoing on Asiatic black bears. Brown bears in Nepal were only seasonally seen as they stayed in Tibet most of the time. Further, Chure and Terai landscapes were more related to my upbringing, and I was more comfortable working in these landscapes. So I decided to work on sloth bears and  was fortunate enough to receive a MEXT scholarship from the Japanese government to complete my Ph.D.\nSloth bears dwell around Chitwan, Parsa and Bardiya national parks. What sorts of conservation works are going on to their conservation? \nCamera trapping and sign surveys are periodically being carried out in the park, which gives updates on the distribution of bears. This is vital by-catch information for bear conservation. Various conservation actions are being carried out, such as grassland management, but we do not have adequate information if these actions are benefitting bears or harming them. Awareness programs on human-wildlife conflict prevention are being carried out that address the sloth bear issues to some extent. Sloth bear-specific conservation actions are very rare. The conservation of sloth bears is incidental to the preservation of tigers and rhinos. Our conservation actions and priorities have not shifted much in the grounds.\nSloth bears endangered animal. What are the natural and human factors for this? \nGlobally and nationally, the population and its habitats are shrinking, which is the leading cause for its vulnerability. The major anthropogenic causes are habitat loss due to the expansion of agriculture, settlement, and developmental infrastructures. Sloth bears are the topmost species facing the greatest road expansion impact in South Asia. The capture of bear cubs and brutal training by tribal communities to use them as dancing bears for street entertainment used to be one of the major threats. Still, bears are killed for their bile, and there are other superstitions related to bears and their parts consumption that trigger poaching. Further, humans frequently enter the forests to collect wild fruits, honey, and other forest resources that disturb sloth bear habitat.\nSloth bears have existed in small and isolated patches. Continuous breeding among related individuals leads to the deterioration of genetic health, ultimately contributing to a decline in their fitness to survive. Sloth bear habitat across their range is experiencing changing land use, land cover, and climate. With changing temperature and precipitation regimes, vegetation structure and composition change, and plants and insects shift their distribution range, directly impacting sloth bears. Changing water tables, decreasing grassland habitats, and increasing invasive species may also impact sloth bears. Tigers are the only potential predators of sloth bears. An increase in the tiger population across their distribution range may have caused a decline in the sloth bear population.\nTermite, honey and wild fruits are major foods for sloth bears. It doesn’t eat meat by hunting. Still, there are reports of bear-human conflicts. Why such events are occurring? \nUnlike other omnivore bears, sloth bears have more insectivorous and seasonally frugivores. They do not kill to eat meat, but still, the conflict is occurring. We should be clear that in most cases (except some man-eater tigers), animals do not consider humans as natural prey, and they do not intend to kill or attack unless they feel threatened and feel the need to defend themselves.\nThe majority of human-sloth bear conflicts result in serious or minor injury to humans involved. These conflicts occur because many humans living around the park frequently visit the park for collection of forest resources, during which sudden encounters with bears lead to injuries and fatalities. Human casualties are the dominant form of human-sloth bear conflict, accounting for more than 95% of all recorded conflict cases. Livestock loss accounted for less than 5 % of the total cases of human-sloth bear conflict in Chitwan.\nMost conflicts with sloth bears occur when people are not alert enough and are engaged in activities like collecting wild vegetables, fodder, and fuelwood. Attacks occur due to poor visibility and high shrub cover along forest paths. Another reason is that sloth bears are naturally aggressive, and their aggressiveness increases during their reproduction and when females have cubs. The majority of attacks occur when a female tries to defend their cubs. Many victims (>60%) say that when the bear attacked them, they saw more than one bear in the area. As habitats have become fragmented and the population around parks is increasing, there are frequent encounters between bears and humans. Since there are no strict fences or boundaries between the park and human agriculture, land bears often venture outside of the park boundary. The migration of youth and the increasing trend of leaving barren lands may have further facilitated the movement of bears outside their core area and increased the chances of encounters and conflicts.\nSloth bears are found in Nepal, India and Sri Lanka. However, in the global discourse of sloth bear, India is mentioned most of the time. Why so? \nPioneer academic research and information on sloth ecology and behavior ear was done in Nepal in the late 70s by Laurie and Seidensticker and in the late 90s by Joshi and Garshelis. Many authors acknowledge this information on sloth bears from Nepal. However, there have been very few follow-up studies in Nepal compared to India. The media covered Sloth bears, and their appearance in the jungle book as Baloo popularized it as a product of India. Further, many sloth bears kept in zoos outside have been taken from India, popularizing it as occurring in India. Sloth bears were first described from India, and most of the distribution range and population is in India. In addition, this may also be driven by the strong scientific institutions backed up by India’s high political and economic influencing status.\nSloth bear carries baby in its back for almost seven to nine months something akin to kangaroo. Female sloth bear expecting baby stays in cave. Sloth bear doesn’t have teeth in its front. Besides, what are the other interesting features of sloth bears? \nIndeed, if we look closely at nature, we will see many fascinating and unique things. Generally, all the bear species are considered omnivores, but sloth bears have a unique feeding habit. It’s fascinating to know that the giant body of sloth bears results from consuming tiny little insects, mostly termites and ants. My study found that 90% of its diet comprises termites and ants. How many numbers of termites and ants would a bear consume in a month, can you imagine? Their nose has few hairs and it can open and close the nostrils as needed to help keep the insects crawling up inside the nose while slurping the ants and termites. Other than insects, they love to eat wild fruits. They are said to get intoxicated by consuming fruits like Mauha, similar to that of African elephants getting drunk by feeding on Marula fruits. They do not hunt to eat meat as other carnivores like tigers or leopards. But there was an interesting case of a sloth bear killing around 90 goats in Madi Valley, Chitwan. Such behavior is rare. A few times sloth bears are reported to consume carrion left by other predators. They are very good climbers and love to eat honey. Infantiside is often common in bears, and reported for sloth bears.\nSloth bear has average age of 40 and average weight of 80. Few months ago, while talking to journalists at Sauraha of Chitwan, you had talked about tourism potential of sloth bear in Nepal something similar to what Australia is doing from Kangaroo. How can we add tourism value to the sloth bear? \nThe Australian government is very strict about preserving its native flora and fauna. Kangaroos and koalas are very popular and promoted as symbols of Australia. The distribution, habitat, and behaviors of these species have been very well understood, and their unique features have been promoted in the tourism industry. Tourists can go on a Kangaroo safari, walk in the bushes to see Kangaroos or visit parks, rescue centers, and zoos where they have been kept in almost natural habitats. Sloth Bear provides a similar avenue for reaping benefits from nature-based tourism. Hotspots of sloth bear movements and den sites should be identified, and sloth bear trails should be located. Nature guides and tourism entrepreneurs should promote sloth bear viewing, walking, tracking, and other innovative ideas as tourism products. I have seen tourists satisfied after viewing sloth bears, even if they have not seen other wildlife. Injured, conflict-causing bears can be kept in a bear sanctuary and promoted as an educational and tourism center. Diversification of tourism services, innovative ideas and entrepreneurship is essential. Sloth Bear can boost nature-based tourism potential like kangaroo of Australia. Promoting sloth bear tourism would help spread the benefits of tourism beyond Chitwan for communities along the Churia landscape. I think this will take good investment and time. Current investment on sloth bears conservation is almost nil, very unsatisfactory. Its conservation is incidental to conservation efforts undertaken for other species like tigers and rhinos.

Dr. Sharma is a leading expert in the field of sustainable and regenerative agriculture, as well as regional planning. Dr. Sharma has a Ph.D. in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, U.S.A. His doctoral study primarily focused on adopting sustainable agricultural practices by farming communities using socio-psychological behavioral theories and mixed research methods. He also holds two master’s degrees, one in Regional Development Planning from the prestigious SPRING program jointly offered by the University of Dortmund, Germany & University of the Philippines, Quezon City, and the other in Anthropology from Tribhuvan University (T.U.), Nepal. Having also acquired his primary bachelor’s degree in agriculture from T. U. Rampur campus in Chitwan, with nearly two decades of experience serving at a senior position in the Nepalese Government at various capacities in the Department of Agriculture and its wings, Dr. Sharma has some rich perspectives and ideas to share on Nepalese farming that could be beneficial to our nationwide readers, policymakers, and people abroad.\nExcerpts: \nBased on your rich experience working with the farming communities of Nepal spanning two decades, and serving as a senior extension official in the Department of Agriculture in the past, where do you think the problem lies when it comes to making agriculture a sustainable source of livelihood and income for Nepalese farmers?\nAgriculture has stood as the backbone of Nepalese economy for decades, still contributing almost one-fourth chunk of its GDP, however Nepalese farmers for the most part have hardly got the opportunity to rise above the subsistence level, when it comes to diversifying their income from agriculture. At least 80% of Nepal’s 19.5 million farming population are still bordering the poverty line and struggling to make their ends meet from agriculture. These farming communities are constantly faced with the challenge of reconciling their economic needs with farming as their principal source of income and livelihood support on the one hand, while protecting the productive capacity of their farmlands, on the other. These farmers need a clear roadmap of farming practices that they need to undertake which could not only support their farming occupation and livelihoods in the long term, but also safeguards their farmland against major environmental stressors such as the unfolding climate change crisis and unpredictable weather patterns posing considerable risks to subsistence-based farming. Nepalese farmers are often confronted to cope with prolonged droughts in some regions of the country, while navigating their lives with unforeseen precipitation in other parts, often resulting in flash floods and landslides, a major contributor of farmland degradation arising from topsoil loss and erosion.\nNepal have consistently lacked in bridging the polices and implementation gap over the years with regards to production increment of major cereal crops such as rice, wheat and maize including other cash crops, while protecting the environment, farmers’ wellbeing, and human health at the same time. The main problem in Nepalese agriculture lies in prioritizing resources to address the symptoms of the problems without addressing its underlying cause. I believe that agriculture in Nepal could reach to newer heights if we start to focus on the right polices and actions based on our rich ecological niche, varying climatic zones, and align human and financial resources accordingly to uplift the farming population with economic opportunities and technological access. However, at this point, it seems that the government and its partners are misguided over several decades by focusing resources and efforts in production and productivity enhancement of cereals, cash crops, and vegetables through forcibly carving a one-size-fits-all “commercialization of agriculture” bandwagon, through over-reliance and dependency on imported commercial fertilizers and pesticides. Such an approach to food production and poverty reduction has not served us well in the past, and therefore needs to change for the better.\n\nI think it would be more prudent to convey message to the farming communities in first prioritizing the protection of topsoil and conservation of its agricultural biodiversity through the widescale adoption of regenerative and sustainable farming practices applying time-tested agro-ecological principles. I firmly believe adoption of such an approach will yield sustainable and rewarding results in the long term. To accomplish this, the government and its partners need to provide farmers with the resources, tools, and needed support through grants, subsidies, and training along this direction. Although government policy documents hinted at striving to reach food self-sufficiency for its people, I seriously doubt this coveted goal could be achieved in the foreseeable future without first addressing the topsoil loss from erosion, and agrobiodiversity issue, which unfortunately are on a declining trend in Nepalese farming context.\nWhy conservation of topsoil is important in the context of Nepalese agriculture? Can you elaborate further?  \nGeologically, Nepal’s landmass is crafted and shaped from the constant collision of the tectonic plates underneath the Himalayas and is relatively young, as per scientific studies. As such, the topography of Nepal is a fragile landscape with mountains, hills, and terai cascading and overlapping in regions with varying relief features and climatic niches. Only one-fifth of the landmass of Nepal is arable land, capable of supporting farming. The rest of the country’s landmass comprised of sloping lands with rivers, valleys, gorges, and steep mountainous terrain. Since farmland is a scarce resource in Nepal, with average agricultural landholding of only 0.55 hectares, therefore, protection of this limited cultivable land is vital for ensuring food security for its 29.6 million population growing annually at 1.7%. Being a fragile and sloping topography especially in the Mid-hills and Churia (Siwalik) range, where agriculture is practiced by rural communities as the main source of livelihood support, Nepal’s farmland in this region is often prone to severe topsoil loss from erosion and landslides especially during the monsoon season.\nAccording to one recent study, Nepal is losing topsoil at an exceedingly high rate ranging from 11.2 tons per hectare up to 64 tons per hectare. When topsoil is lost at such an alarming rate, the capacity of the land to produce food and fiber for supporting people’s livelihood is compromised both in the short and long term. This is because topsoil is rich in organic matter, which often takes decades and centuries to form under the natural process and is the very essence of life-support system that provides resilience and sustainability to farmlands. Furthermore, the topsoil that is eroded from the hilly and mountainous region carrying huge amounts of silt and clay during the monsoon overwhelms the river system and farmlands in terai causing inundation, loss of crop production from sedimentation deposits, and displacement of farm families. On top of that, loss of lives and property from landslides and soil erosion is a regular phenomenon repeating every year in Nepal. Such natural calamities impose a significant burden on the national treasury in managing reparations, damages, and losses. It is evident that all these issues and problems are interconnected. Therefore, conservation of topsoil is critical for Nepal from the perspective of the country’s food security, protection of its rich agrobiodiversity, and building socio-economic resilience.\nCan you throw some light regarding agrobiodiversity decline in general and the case of Nepal in particular? How did this happen, and what should be done to address such an issue? \nAgrobiodiversity is the richness of genetic diversity of crops, seeds, and species of edible plants and other living organisms in a geographic region that are harbored by nature through generations following the natural selection process. Most of the plant agrobiodiversity available in nature comprises of different genus and species of crops and their cultivars that are open-pollinated. In other words, farmers can save the seeds of these open-pollinated crops for the next growing season. Agrobiodiversity decline occurs from multiple factors that includes both natural and anthropogenic. In the Nepalese context, when topsoil is lost through erosion or agricultural lands are converted into human settlements, which is already happening since the last several decades due to rapid urban sprawl in the country, a lot of the agrobiodiversity that was inherent within those landscapes is also lost in the process. Simultaneously, when farmers start to relinquish their open-pollinated crop cultivars and begin cultivating hybrid varieties on their farmlands for a few generations, then agrobiodiversity loss occurs rapidly. This happens because open-pollinated crops start to lose their viability to procreate if their seeds are not planted by farmers for a few years.\nThe practice of widescale monocropping with the advent of modern industrial farming, especially in developed countries, and subsequent upscaling of such monocultural practices in our part of the world, has also resulted in a significant loss of agrobiodiversity from farmlands. Once agrobiodiversity is lost from nature, it is gone forever. As per one recent study, out of 24,300 total species of agricultural genetic resources available in Nepal, the country has lost close to 40% of those species so far, and the trend of agrobiodiversity loss is worsening every year.\nNepal is not the only country that is facing the agrobiodiversity crisis, it is a global phenomenon, posing some dire consequences for the human species and the planet’s future. The best way to minimize or halt agrobiodiversity loss is through seed savings and conservation of genetic diversity by individual farmers and groups through farm diversification and by establishment of community seed banks. The government initiated National seed bank, for instance the one currently existing in Kathmandu valley under the management of National Agricultural Research Council, should be the last resort of hope toward seed conservation, because the cost of maintaining such a facility in terms of manpower, energy requirement, and resources is huge. Nevertheless, Nepal needs at least a couple of such seed banks in times of emergency. However, at this point, farmers and citizens awareness and actions toward promoting community seed banks is therefore the least costly and viable option for safeguarding against agrobiodiversity loss both in the case of Nepal and globally for ensuring food security for the current and future generations.\nWhat types of currently adopted agricultural practices and other development trends in Nepal are detrimental to safeguarding its long-term agricultural sustainability? \nWe have seen farming communities in Nepal growing annual crops like corn and millet even in sloping lands without proper terracing, resulting in a heavy loss of topsoil from erosion and landslides every year. The phenomena of topsoil loss are very much visible in sloping terraces especially after the heavy monsoon rains. This has resulted in degradation of farming landscapes with severe decline in soil productivity and its functionality over the years. The government needs to carve policies and actions that prohibit annual crop farming in high sloping lands while providing subsidies and motivating farmers to grow perennial grasses, forages, fodders, fruit trees, and shrubs as well as a combination of various conservation practices in steep and semi-steep slopes. Adoption of such a policy would result in protection of vulnerable and erodible landscapes, especially in the Mid- and High-hill regions against soil erosion and landslides, following heavy downpour especially in the monsoon season.\nAnother disturbing trend often observed in Nepal is the rapid conversion of its prime agricultural land into urban settlements and towns without consideration of its inherent land use potential and the capacity of such lands to support agricultural production and food security both in the long and short term. For example, as reported in one recent research study published in 2023, about 25% of the agricultural land in Kathmandu valley had been converted to urban settlements during the 10-year period from 2011-2021. Such development trend is often short-sighted and could result in unpredictability in food supply and long-term scarcity of food for the rapidly growing country’s population. Since Nepal is already a heavy importer of grains, pulses and other essential food commodities from its neighbors like India, China and other food exporters, what we have witnessed over several decades is that Nepal is reeling under an ever-increasing import-export imbalance and trade deficit. As such, it has become a moral imperative for Nepal to protect its prime agricultural land in the form of a regulated and sustainable land use policy to ensure its food security.\nWhat broad policy recommendations do you have for the Government of Nepal to make Nepalese agriculture sustainable and resilient? \nSome broad policy changes I would suggest for Nepal is to divest resources from commercial fertilizers and chemical pesticides importation and instead invest it in sustainable and regenerative agriculture both at the farm and landscape level. The government should provide substantial resources and technical support to the farming communities for motivating them in adopting a sustainable agricultural pathway. Given the vulnerability of its population already facing food insecurity especially in the remote regions, the widely used catchphrase “commercialization of agriculture” in the Nepalese context, may have been sending the wrong message to the farming communities. Farmers may connote this message to simply boost food production by adopting all available means of production, even though they are unsustainable. The main goal of a sustainable agricultural system should not be to only boost food production and sell it in the market for short-term economic return. Nepal must instead make every effort to train farmers and community members to produce food locally by building soil health and conserving its limited land resources to reach food self-sufficiency, without relying on synthetic fertilizers and agrochemicals. Research and efforts by farming communities from around the world have shown that reaching food self-sufficiency is not a distant dream if regenerative agricultural practices are adopted with a land conservation and stewardship mindset.\nFurthermore, Nepal urgently needs to curb unregulated infiltration of banned pesticides and agro-chemicals from its porous southern border. This could be achieved by strictly regulating its Plant Quarantine check posts at border points while revamping its monitoring and supervision capacities. Raising increased awareness among the farming communities and providing them the tools and resources needed in adopting sustainable practices on their farms is another viable way to tackle this issue in the long-term.\nAlongside, Nepal should massively invest its resources and efforts in regreening barren landscapes and degraded farmlands with afforestation by applying time-tested agroforestry principles and techniques. The end-goal should be to create a functional agricultural landscape and food forest where nature, people and biodiversity thrive together in perpetuity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","summary":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKATHMANDU: In an exclusive interview with Dr. Suresh Sharma, Nepal Press shares some thoughts on Nepalese agriculture and its future.

How did this happen, and what should be done to address such an issue? \nAgrobiodiversity is the richness of genetic diversity of crops, seeds, and species of edible plants and other living organisms in a geographic region that are harbored by nature through generations following the natural selection process. Most of the plant agrobiodiversity available in nature comprises of different genus and species of crops and their cultivars that are open-pollinated. In other words, farmers can save the seeds of these open-pollinated crops for the next growing season. Agrobiodiversity decline occurs from multiple factors that includes both natural and anthropogenic. In the Nepalese context, when topsoil is lost through erosion or agricultural lands are converted into human settlements, which is already happening since the last several decades due to rapid urban sprawl in the country, a lot of the agrobiodiversity that was inherent within those landscapes is also lost in the process. Simultaneously, when farmers start to relinquish their open-pollinated crop cultivars and begin cultivating hybrid varieties on their farmlands for a few generations, then agrobiodiversity loss occurs rapidly. This happens because open-pollinated crops start to lose their viability to procreate if their seeds are not planted by farmers for a few years.\nThe practice of widescale monocropping with the advent of modern industrial farming, especially in developed countries, and subsequent upscaling of such monocultural practices in our part of the world, has also resulted in a significant loss of agrobiodiversity from farmlands. Once agrobiodiversity is lost from nature, it is gone forever. As per one recent study, out of 24,300 total species of agricultural genetic resources available in Nepal, the country has lost close to 40% of those species so far, and the trend of agrobiodiversity loss is worsening every year.\nNepal is not the only country that is facing the agrobiodiversity crisis, it is a global phenomenon, posing some dire consequences for the human species and the planet’s future. The best way to minimize or halt agrobiodiversity loss is through seed savings and conservation of genetic diversity by individual farmers and groups through farm diversification and by establishment of community seed banks. The government initiated National seed bank, for instance the one currently existing in Kathmandu valley under the management of National Agricultural Research Council, should be the last resort of hope toward seed conservation, because the cost of maintaining such a facility in terms of manpower, energy requirement, and resources is huge. Nevertheless, Nepal needs at least a couple of such seed banks in times of emergency. However, at this point, farmers and citizens awareness and actions toward promoting community seed banks is therefore the least costly and viable option for safeguarding against agrobiodiversity loss both in the case of Nepal and globally for ensuring food security for the current and future generations.\nWhat types of currently adopted agricultural practices and other development trends in Nepal are detrimental to safeguarding its long-term agricultural sustainability? \nWe have seen farming communities in Nepal growing annual crops like corn and millet even in sloping lands without proper terracing, resulting in a heavy loss of topsoil from erosion and landslides every year. The phenomena of topsoil loss are very much visible in sloping terraces especially after the heavy monsoon rains. This has resulted in degradation of farming landscapes with severe decline in soil productivity and its functionality over the years. The government needs to carve policies and actions that prohibit annual crop farming in high sloping lands while providing subsidies and motivating farmers to grow perennial grasses, forages, fodders, fruit trees, and shrubs as well as a combination of various conservation practices in steep and semi-steep slopes. Adoption of such a policy would result in protection of vulnerable and erodible landscapes, especially in the Mid- and High-hill regions against soil erosion and landslides, following heavy downpour especially in the monsoon season.\nAnother disturbing trend often observed in Nepal is the rapid conversion of its prime agricultural land into urban settlements and towns without consideration of its inherent land use potential and the capacity of such lands to support agricultural production and food security both in the long and short term. For example, as reported in one recent research study published in 2023, about 25% of the agricultural land in Kathmandu valley had been converted to urban settlements during the 10-year period from 2011-2021. Such development trend is often short-sighted and could result in unpredictability in food supply and long-term scarcity of food for the rapidly growing country’s population. Since Nepal is already a heavy importer of grains, pulses and other essential food commodities from its neighbors like India, China and other food exporters, what we have witnessed over several decades is that Nepal is reeling under an ever-increasing import-export imbalance and trade deficit. As such, it has become a moral imperative for Nepal to protect its prime agricultural land in the form of a regulated and sustainable land use policy to ensure its food security.\nWhat broad policy recommendations do you have for the Government of Nepal to make Nepalese agriculture sustainable and resilient? \nSome broad policy changes I would suggest for Nepal is to divest resources from commercial fertilizers and chemical pesticides importation and instead invest it in sustainable and regenerative agriculture both at the farm and landscape level. The government should provide substantial resources and technical support to the farming communities for motivating them in adopting a sustainable agricultural pathway. Given the vulnerability of its population already facing food insecurity especially in the remote regions, the widely used catchphrase “commercialization of agriculture” in the Nepalese context, may have been sending the wrong message to the farming communities. Farmers may connote this message to simply boost food production by adopting all available means of production, even though they are unsustainable. The main goal of a sustainable agricultural system should not be to only boost food production and sell it in the market for short-term economic return. Nepal must instead make every effort to train farmers and community members to produce food locally by building soil health and conserving its limited land resources to reach food self-sufficiency, without relying on synthetic fertilizers and agrochemicals. Research and efforts by farming communities from around the world have shown that reaching food self-sufficiency is not a distant dream if regenerative agricultural practices are adopted with a land conservation and stewardship mindset.\nFurthermore, Nepal urgently needs to curb unregulated infiltration of banned pesticides and agro-chemicals from its porous southern border. This could be achieved by strictly regulating its Plant Quarantine check posts at border points while revamping its monitoring and supervision capacities. Raising increased awareness among the farming communities and providing them the tools and resources needed in adopting sustainable practices on their farms is another viable way to tackle this issue in the long-term.\nAlongside, Nepal should massively invest its resources and efforts in regreening barren landscapes and degraded farmlands with afforestation by applying time-tested agroforestry principles and techniques. The end-goal should be to create a functional agricultural landscape and food forest where nature, people and biodiversity thrive together in perpetuity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"hash":"2baf20ba3217a10fb92a96cdc548b1cce484f9ef87d394e998f60d5c9b0f7f67","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWFP Nepal accused of ‘perpetuating hunger’ in Karnali, pressured to ‘review report’ on ending freebies\t\t\t\t\t","date":"June 13, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","source":"np","link":"https://english.nepalpress.com/2024/06/13/wfp-nepal-accused-of-perpetuating-hunger-in-karnali-pressured-to-review-report-on-ending-freebies/","imageLink":"https://english.nepalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/UN-WFP-himbu.png","category":null,"content":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKATHMANDU: In what appears to be in line with widespread accusations that donor agencies want to continue hunger to profit from their philanthropic deeds, a recent book has unveiled that the World Food Program (WFP) is intentionally perpetuating hunger in Nepal’s Karnali region to profit from their philanthropic efforts.\nIn ‘Himbu’, an autobiography by Nepal’s renowned tourism entrepreneur Mr. Lhakpa Sonam Sherpa, the author sheds light on these claims from both an insider and outsider perspective.\nSherpa, who has airlifted WFP-supported food to Karnali for 18 years from his Tara Air, shares his firsthand experience with distributing free food in the region.

This interconnectedness is a powerful reminder that our choices, no matter how insignificant they may seem, ripple across the globe, affecting not just our lives but also the environment and those in distant lands.\nWhen a person in a distant country decides to drive a little more, thinking it won’t make a difference, that choice could indirectly contribute to the melting glaciers in the majestic mountains of Nepal. This illustrates how deeply interconnected our global system truly is. The boundaries that separate us—whether a country is classified as less developed, developing, or developed—blur in the face of the climate crisis.\nAs we reflect on these connections, we must confront a crucial question: who is responsible for these global changes, and who bears the brunt of their consequences? In this web of complex global connections, we are all part of the same story. Every action counts, and our collective story is shaped by our choices.\nSome countries, like Tuvalu—a small island developing state located halfway between Hawaii and Australia—exemplify the grave injustice inherent in this situation. The people of Tuvalu, with one of the smallest per-capita carbon footprints globally, grapple daily with the consequences of climate change, struggling to cultivate their staple foods as rising tides sweep away their land. Nepal, too, finds itself on the front lines, paying a heavy price for a crisis it did not cause.\nOne recent tragedy in Nepal underscores the country’s vulnerability. This year’s monsoon season brought extreme, erratic rainfall—some of the heaviest in over 50 years—triggering catastrophic floods and landslides that claimed dozens of lives. Within a few days, more than 200 people lost their lives, while many others were injured or displaced as homes, roads, and infrastructure were swept away. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, and rainfall patterns are growing increasingly unpredictable, both of which can be linked to climate change.\nSimilarly, the spread of malaria to Nepal’s mountainous regions is a troubling sign of climate change. Historically, malaria was virtually unknown in these colder areas, but rising temperatures have allowed mosquitoes to thrive. In a remote village in far-western Nepal, over 900 malaria cases have been reported in the last three years—a significant increase for an area that was once free of such diseases. A community health volunteer in the region shared that the health burden has worsened as warmer temperatures make it easier for mosquitoes to breed in these high-altitude areas.\nAnother such story is about the rain-shadow zone in Nepal, traditionally a dry region even during the monsoon season. However, rising temperatures are now causing more intense and frequent rains, resulting in landslides and floods that contaminate local water sources. What used to be a reliable supply of fresh meltwater is now often polluted, leading to frequent diarrhea and other health problems. As a result, waterborne diseases have become the second most significant health concern for the village’s residents.\nWhile people in such remote regions may not be familiar with terms like “climate change” or “global warming,” their experiences reflect its impact. Sadly, their stories often go unheard, both within their country and at international gatherings like COP.\nAs the COP 29 climate summit approaches this November in Azerbaijan, the question remains: will the voices of vulnerable nations like Nepal be heard? It seems as though the focus lies on setting an increased target for the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), but little attention is given to the strategic approach needed for managing these funds, given the inconsistencies observed in previous years.\nAccording to OECD data, 2022 marked a significant milestone: climate finance finally surpassed the US$100 billion target set in 2009, reaching US$115.9 billion. While this achievement came two years later than the original 2020 goal, it still represents a crucial step forward. However, it’s essential to examine how these funds have been allocated to support the most vulnerable populations.\nFrom 2015 to 2020, developed countries paid approximately $353 billion, with $189 billion coming from direct country-to-country payments. While these payments were intended as donations to support developing nations, 54% of the funding was provided as loans, leading to increased debt challenges for countries grappling with problems largely caused by the developed world.\nIn 2022, climate finance directed toward low-income countries remained relatively low, accounting for only 10%. The OECD report revealed that, similar to prior years, public climate finance was predominantly composed of loans, which represented 69% or $63.6 billion. Not all of these loans were concessional; some were provided at market rates. In comparison, grants constituted only 28% of the total, amounting to $25.6 billion, while equity investments were even less significant at $2.4 billion.\nThis approach of giving funds as loans at market rates is unusual for climate-related and other aid projects, which typically feature low or zero interest rates. Therefore, even if the pledge is fulfilled, we can conclude that it is exaggerated, as donor countries will redeem a significant portion of the climate finance through loan repayments and interest.\nSurprisingly, investments in retail stores, hotels, airports, and movie theaters have been classified as climate finance. For instance, Italy has invested in Asia to establish chocolate and gelato shops, while the United States provided loans to Haiti for developing coastal hotels. Meanwhile, Japan funded a new coal plant in Bangladesh and supported airport expansion in Egypt. These peculiar investments are being labeled as climate finance, despite the absence of official guidelines to regulate such activities. The responsible entity, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), seems more focused on tallying numbers than on making a genuine impact on climate change issues in the affected countries.\nThe goal of mobilizing $100 billion annually for climate action, as agreed upon in the Paris Agreement, can be seen through the lens of the butterfly effect. Investing in renewable energy, conservation, and adaptation strategies can lead to profound shifts in global carbon emissions, biodiversity, and community resilience.\nWhile climate finance is intended to support the poorest nations as compensation from developed countries, it has increasingly become a mechanism through which rich countries provide climate funding with interest attached. Climate finance has become a business venture, and money is being redirected back to the respective donor economies. As a result, vulnerable nations are stuck in a vicious cycle. With extreme weather conditions, they face economic losses that leave them with no other option but to take loans from developed countries. With heavy debt, they will have fewer resources to invest in climate solutions, further increasing the risk of climate stress. A report from the United Nations Development Program shows that fifty-four nations, including Egypt, Kenya, and Sri Lanka, which are heavily indebted by climate loans, are facing higher costs due to climate change.\nGiven such inconsistencies in fund allocation and effectiveness, there is a need to highlight the importance of a more thoughtful approach. As COP 29 approaches, it is imperative that discussions go beyond mere financial commitments and recognize the significance of equitable climate finance, ensuring that funds are allocated effectively to support those most affected. By prioritizing grants over loans and investing in genuine solutions rather than superficial projects, we can harness the power of collective action to create a positive ripple effect.\nJust as the flap of a butterfly’s wings can set off far-reaching changes, so too can the conscious choices of developed nations in climate finance help foster resilience, promote sustainability, and bridge the global inequities at the heart of the climate crisis. In the face of growing climate challenges, vulnerable countries like Nepal need genuine investment and immediate support—not empty promises or token gestures. As climate impacts intensify, the world’s most vulnerable countries must not be left to navigate this crisis alone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","summary":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKATHMANDU: The butterfly effect is the idea that even the smallest action—a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world—can set off a chain of events that leads to far-reaching consequences.

But how we design and maintain infrastructure determines if hazards turn into disasters. Since today’s decisions affect the future, it is crucial that development be risk-sensitive. Disasters are not natural, they are the results of risk-insensitive development activities. For instance, in 2021/22 in a village in western Nepal, when technicians were planning to construct a bridge across the Mahadeva River, locals suggested a different alignment of the bridge to avoid the annual monsoon flood, which they face annually. However, the technicians disregarded communities’ suggestions and constructed what they thought was the best design. The next year, the flood entered the village. Likewise, in another Rural Municipality of the same region, locals suggested not constructing a hospital near a local river called Dolai, which is flood-prone, but again their suggestion was not considered. Now the hospital is vulnerable to inundation during seasonal monsoon rains. If a hazard is amplified to a disaster due to the ignorance of individuals (e.g. authorities, technicians and households) of local geography, risk histories, knowledge and community participation, we call it an “engineered disaster”.\nThe above are just representative examples of the ways in which development can create risk in Nepal. Every year, hundreds of such infrastructures are constructed without the knowledge and study of local risk geographies exposing them to hazards. The floods and landslides triggered by the 26-28 September 2024 rainfall, which took the lives of more than 240 people and loss of valuable infrastructure (e.g. roads, irrigation, energy, water, agriculture, etc.) incurring more than 15 billion Nepali rupees (initial estimation), were amplified due to the prevalence of infrastructure and houses on the banks of rivers. Given the huge loss Nepal experienced in the September 2024 catastrophe, we have the following five suggestions for future risk-sensitive development and urbanization. Implementing these is essential for Nepal to achieve a risk-resilient society as envisioned by the National Climate Change Policy 2019.\nFirst\nJust as countries located near the sea teach swimming to their citizens, given Nepal’s exposure to various hazards, providing education in geography and geology should be an integral part of the school-to-university education system, especially for those teaching technical subjects. Additionally, with its width ranging from lowland southern Tarai (<300 meters above sea level) to the Himalaya (8848 masl i.e. Mt. Everest) within around 200 kilometers, the geomorphology, climate and vegetation resemble areas ranging from equatorial to polar regions. So, the engineering methods used in the Tarai may not fit in the Hill and Himalayan regions. The models, methods and formulas used in other countries will need to be customized to fit local geography and geology. Without this, infrastructures turn into the very tools for amplifying hazard and disaster impacts, leading to the creation of more engineered disasters.\nSecond\nThe government has to regulate the haphazard expansion of settlements and the excavation of sand and rocks near river banks and upstream areas immediately. The widespread disaster caused by the September floods in the Kathmandu Valley was also due to the mining in river banks for construction materials. The growing construction in the surrounding hills (locally called kanth) and lowland areas (dol) of the Kathmandu Valley led rainfall water to flow directly into the main river, triggering overflowing and flooding. Additionally, the huge destruction that occurred in the Roshi River (Kavrepalanchwok district) and Nakhkhu River (Lalitpur district) was a great consequence of such haphazard excavation. Learning from the September 2024 disaster, therefore, the government has to focus on regulating haphazard construction and excavation as a national priority.\nThird\nThe haphazard road construction in the mid-hills region, an area of relatively soft geology, has led to increased landslide hazard. Without considering slope stability and monsoon water management during the construction, such roads can turn into creeks. Runoff can mix downstream rivers with debris including soil, sand, leaves and small rocks causing lateral erosion and landslides en route. Such disasters had already occurred in Nepal. Therefore, such haphazard road construction has to be highly regulated to encourage only the construction of high-quality and risk-resilient roads targeting local economic development.\nFourth\nImportantly, risk analysis is not routinely undertaken before infrastructure development. This should be an essential early step for risk reduction of potential hazards. For instance, if the risk analysis of the Melamchi Water Project (Sindhupalchwok district) had been done, we could have avoided the loss of huge destruction caused by landslides in June 2021. By studying the local geography, drainage system, past hazards, we could assess and avoid the potential impacts of construction on local geography and society thereby the sustainability and resilience of infrastructures. Hazards are a natural phenomenon, therefore if we, for example, can spend an additional 1 rupee for risk reduction at present we could avoid disaster equivalent to 10 rupees in the future. Alternatively, continuing infrastructure development without risk analysis means we are creating a favorable environment for future disasters.\nFifth\nNepal is highly vulnerable to landslides, floods, fires, earthquakes and climate change so the agencies related to risk management during and after disasters must be fully prepared. Unfortunately, the amplified catastrophe of September 2024 was also due to the government’s delayed rescue operation. For instance, in the September flood, four people standing on the roof of their house, which was corralled by the Nakkhu River flood, called for help for several hours but unluckily nobody reached there for help. The river swept their house, luckily two survived. Moreover, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology alerted the government regarding the September heavy rainfall and potential disasters more than a week before, the disaster management apertures of the government could not prepare and make necessary decisions in advance, consequently, people faced a huge loss. To avoid similar blunders in future, the risk reduction and management (e.g. rescue and relief) departments and line agencies must be in the ready-to-go form throughout the year.\nFinally, another rainfall akin to September 2024 could reoccur in Nepal. It may take a couple of decades, but there is a high chance of the reoccurrence. Therefore, to meet the goal of the National Climate Change Policy 2019, the three tiers of the government i.e. federal, provincial and local should consider, as suggested above, developing a risk-resilient society by considering local risk geography and promoting risk-sensitive infrastructure development in their constituencies from today.\nDr. Poudel is associated with Southasia Institute of Advanced Studies (SIAS), Nepal and Dr. Pelling is associated with University College London (UCL), United Kingdom\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","summary":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhenomena like floods, landslides and earthquakes are the medium of hazard. But how we design and maintain infrastructure determines if hazards turn into disasters. Since today’s decisions affect the future, it is crucial that development be risk-sensitive. Disasters are not natural, they are the results of risk-insensitive development activities. For instance, in 2021/22 in a village in western Nepal, when technicians were planning to construct a bridge across the Mahadeva River, locals suggested a different alignment of the bridge to avoid the annual monsoon flood, which they face annually. However, the technicians disregarded communities’ suggestions and constructed what they thought was the best design. The next year, the flood entered the village. Likewise, in another Rural Municipality of the same region, locals suggested not constructing a hospital near a local river called Dolai, which is flood-prone, but again their suggestion was not considered. Now the hospital is vulnerable to inundation during seasonal monsoon rains. If a hazard is amplified to a disaster due to the ignorance of individuals (e.g. authorities, technicians and households) of local geography, risk histories, knowledge and community participation, we call it an “engineered disaster”.\nThe above are just representative examples of the ways in which development can create risk in Nepal. Every year, hundreds of such infrastructures are constructed without the knowledge and study of local risk geographies exposing them to hazards. The floods and landslides triggered by the 26-28 September 2024 rainfall, which took the lives of more than 240 people and loss of valuable infrastructure (e.g. roads, irrigation, energy, water, agriculture, etc.) incurring more than 15 billion Nepali rupees (initial estimation), were amplified due to the prevalence of infrastructure and houses on the banks of rivers. Given the huge loss Nepal experienced in the September 2024 catastrophe, we have the following five suggestions for future risk-sensitive development and urbanization. Implementing these is essential for Nepal to achieve a risk-resilient society as envisioned by the National Climate Change Policy 2019.\nFirst\nJust as countries located near the sea teach swimming to their citizens, given Nepal’s exposure to various hazards, providing education in geography and geology should be an integral part of the school-to-university education system, especially for those teaching technical subjects. Additionally, with its width ranging from lowland southern Tarai (<300 meters above sea level) to the Himalaya (8848 masl i.e. Mt. Everest) within around 200 kilometers, the geomorphology, climate and vegetation resemble areas ranging from equatorial to polar regions. So, the engineering methods used in the Tarai may not fit in the Hill and Himalayan regions. The models, methods and formulas used in other countries will need to be customized to fit local geography and geology. Without this, infrastructures turn into the very tools for amplifying hazard and disaster impacts, leading to the creation of more engineered disasters.\nSecond\nThe government has to regulate the haphazard expansion of settlements and the excavation of sand and rocks near river banks and upstream areas immediately. The widespread disaster caused by the September floods in the Kathmandu Valley was also due to the mining in river banks for construction materials. The growing construction in the surrounding hills (locally called kanth) and lowland areas (dol) of the Kathmandu Valley led rainfall water to flow directly into the main river, triggering overflowing and flooding. Additionally, the huge destruction that occurred in the Roshi River (Kavrepalanchwok district) and Nakhkhu River (Lalitpur district) was a great consequence of such haphazard excavation. Learning from the September 2024 disaster, therefore, the government has to focus on regulating haphazard construction and excavation as a national priority.\nThird\nThe haphazard road construction in the mid-hills region, an area of relatively soft geology, has led to increased landslide hazard. Without considering slope stability and monsoon water management during the construction, such roads can turn into creeks. Runoff can mix downstream rivers with debris including soil, sand, leaves and small rocks causing lateral erosion and landslides en route. Such disasters had already occurred in Nepal. Therefore, such haphazard road construction has to be highly regulated to encourage only the construction of high-quality and risk-resilient roads targeting local economic development.\nFourth\nImportantly, risk analysis is not routinely undertaken before infrastructure development. This should be an essential early step for risk reduction of potential hazards. For instance, if the risk analysis of the Melamchi Water Project (Sindhupalchwok district) had been done, we could have avoided the loss of huge destruction caused by landslides in June 2021. By studying the local geography, drainage system, past hazards, we could assess and avoid the potential impacts of construction on local geography and society thereby the sustainability and resilience of infrastructures. Hazards are a natural phenomenon, therefore if we, for example, can spend an additional 1 rupee for risk reduction at present we could avoid disaster equivalent to 10 rupees in the future.

This year holds significant importance in Nepal’s diplomatic standing. On December 14, Nepal appointed Sewa Lamsal as the first woman secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Alongside this milestone, there are several other noteworthy diplomatic events in the oldest sovereign country in South Asia over the past 12 months. Here, we discuss Nepal’s 23 major diplomatic events of 2023:\n1. Pokhara International Airport operation: Nepal’s new year in 2023 began with the addition of a new international airport. The China-financed and constructed airport was formally inaugurated on 1 January. However, it did make the first international flight only on 21 June when a chartered flight from China carrying Ganesh Timalsina, chair of Nepal’s National Assembly and Chinese players for Nepal’s first Dragon Boat Festival. Chinese ambassador to Nepal Chen Song said the airport was part of BRI. After some criticism from the Nepali side that the airport concept was older than BRI’s birth, he didn’t repeat the same phrasing in his other publicly available statements and interviews. Pokhara International Airport has not been operational internationally. On 15 January, Yeti Airlines Flight 691 crashed nearby this airport killing all 72 people onboard.\n2.Four new diplomatic relations: Nepal established new diplomatic ties with four different countries in 2023: Republic of Malawi on February 16, Republic of Nauru on May 4, Republic of Cameroon on June 22, and Republic of Marshall Islands on June 23.\n3.Fake Bhutanese Refugee Scam: May witnessed the arrests of top political and bureaucratic figures in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. Former Deputy Prime Minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and Former Home Minister Balkrishna Khanda were among those arrested.\n4.India visit: Prime Minister Prachanda made a four-day visit to India from May 31 to June 3. His notable outcomes included India’s commitment to purchasing 10,000 megawatts of electricity in the upcoming decade and his counterpart Modi’s acknowledgment that Nepal and India have border problems. Controversially, Modi traveled to a village on Nepal’s border that is considered India-occupied on October 13.\n5.Nepal-Bangladesh power trade: On July 8, Nepal and Bangladesh formally agreed to enter into a long-term electricity export deal from Nepal, with an expected export volume of 40 megawatts. Talks are underway regarding a trilateral hydroelectricity investment involving Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.\n6. China visit: PM Prachanda made an 8-day official visit to China from September 22 to 29. His notable takeaways include the signing of a dozen agreements and memoranda of understanding. These agreements involve Nepal’s shift from the ‘One-China policy’ to the ‘One-China principle,’ as well as the reopening and addition of more bilateral border crossings.\n7. Hamas attacks: On October 7, during Hamas attacks on Israel, ten Nepali students were confirmed killed a day later. Nepal airlifted its citizens on October 11. A Nepali student named Bipin Joshi is still in Hamas captivity.\n8. Russian Ukraine war: On December 4, four Nepalis were officially confirmed killed while fighting alongside Russian forces. The confirmed figure has now reached seven. Four Nepalis are in Ukrainian capture. Nepal has lobbied both Russia and Ukraine to send back Nepalis, but to no avail.\n9. SAARC’s new Secretary General in Kathmandu: In the last week of October, SAARC’s new Secretary-General from Bangladesh, Golam Salwar, assumed his office in Kathmandu. Despite being dysfunctional since its last Kathmandu summit in 2014, SAARC has been paralyzed. However, it has not stopped breathing.\n10. UN Secretary-General arrival in Nepal: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made an official visit to Nepal from October 29 to November 1. He made Himalayan visit and talked about climate crisis in the Himalayas. He gave speech at Nepal’s joint sessions of houses and voiced for justice to conflict victims based on victim-centric international judicial practices.\n11. PM’s Temple diplomacy: Temple diplomacy was a new incarnation of PM Prachanda. From Mahakaleshwar of India (June 2) to Mt. Kailash of China’s Tibet Autonomous Region (September 28) and the visit to Nepal’s Pashupatinath Temple, among others, displayed his temple diplomacy to please Hindu quarters.\n12. North Korean exit: In the first week of November, North Korea formally closed its almost 50-year-old diplomatic mission in Kathmandu. It has assigned its existing New Delhi mission for Nepal’s affairs. With this, Kim Yong Su became the last residential North Korean ambassador to Nepal. He and his entire team left Nepal in the second week of November. He made a farewell call to PM Prachanda before his departure.\n13. Portugal outreach: On November 9, Nepal’s cabinet decided to open a new embassy in Lisbon, Portugal’s capital. At least 20,000 Nepalis are said to have resided in Portugal. Sanil Nepal was picked as the first ambassador from Nepal this month.\n14. Defeat in WHO regional elections: In what appeared to signal Nepal’s diplomatic failure, Nepal witnessed a humiliating defeat for the WHO Regional Director position with the Bangladeshi candidate on November 1. Out of 10 votes, Nepal’s candidate Dr. Shambhu Acharya secured just two votes against the Bangladeshi candidate Sheikh Hasina Wazed.\n15. COP-28: PM Prachanda left for the COP-28 venue in the UAE on November 28. He returned to Nepal on December 3. He gave his speech on December 3. He was also part of the 52nd National Unity Day and ‘Sayed Sustainability Award’ in the UAE. He had bilateral meetings with the UN Secretary-General and some other world leaders, including Indian PM Modi. The issue of Himalayan glacial melt was one of the notable issues at COP-28.\n16. Italy visit: PM Prachanda visited Italy from July 22 to 28. While in Rome, he participated in the WFO-organized ‘Food System Summit +2.’ During his speech, PM Dahal represented Least Developed Countries (LDC) and emphasized increased agricultural investment. Throughout his stay in Rome, he also conducted bilateral meetings with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, among others.\n17. Qatar: Qatar came into the spotlight of Nepal’s diplomacy for three reasons. First, PM Prachanda’s scheduled and canceled visit on February 27. He was supposed to attend a program of the Fifth Conference of the Least Developed Countries and was set to leave the country on March 3. He canceled his visit on February 27 for ‘important political engagements’ in Nepal. If he had visited Qatar, it would have been his first foreign visit. Second reason of Qatari issues was a possible visit by a high level from the gas-rich Arab country. Third reason was Qatar’s potential to meditate for the release of Nepali student Bipin Joshi from Hamas activity.\n18. Australian Minister visit: Australia’s Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts visited Kathmandu from May 16 to 17. He paid a visit to the Hindu shrine of Pashupatinath. As Australia becomes one of the most favored destinations for Nepali students, more top-level visits between the two countries are expected.\n19. MCC: The American project of MCC was ratified by Nepal’s parliament last year. However, the $500 million project is still in limbo when it comes to visible outcomes. Despite no tangible MCC outcomes for transmission lines and roadways, there were high-level visits from the US, including the February 7 visit of the Administrator of the USAID Samantha Power and the July 13 visit of US Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, among others.\n20. BRF: So far, there are no tangible infrastructural outcomes of Nepal’s participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since the first Belt and Road Forum (BRF) in 2017. However, Nepal was not absent in the Third Belt and Road Forum which was held in Beijing from October 17 to 18. Nepal’s delegation was led by Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha.\n21. Electricity trade with China: While claiming the one-year ‘success’ of his government, PM Prachanda highlighted the first ongoing trans-Himalayan transmission lines between Nepal and China. He stated that works are underway to erect the Chilime-Kerung 220 kV transmission lines. When this comes into operation, it would be an added option for Nepal’s incumbent India-dependent energy trade.\n22. Asian Games and Asia Cup Goodwill: From a sporting perspective, Nepal’s two medals at the Hangzhou Asian Games, praiseworthy cricketing performance against heavyweight cricketing nations at the Asia Cup from August 30 to September 17, and participation in the Asian Games from September 23 to October 8 were noted as part of Nepal’s sporting goodwill.\n23. Nepal’s absence in Raisina Dialogue and G-20 Summit: Two notable physical events in Nepal’s southern neighbor were the Raisina Dialogue, held from March 2 to 4 and supported by the Indian Government, which invited many world leaders but not Nepali representatives. Likewise, in the G-20 summit from September 9 to 10, Nepal was absent among the invitees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","summary":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKATHMANDU:  Today is the penultimate day of 2023.

Portugal outreach: On November 9, Nepal’s cabinet decided to open a new embassy in Lisbon, Portugal’s capital. At least 20,000 Nepalis are said to have resided in Portugal. Sanil Nepal was picked as the first ambassador from Nepal this month.\n14. Defeat in WHO regional elections: In what appeared to signal Nepal’s diplomatic failure, Nepal witnessed a humiliating defeat for the WHO Regional Director position with the Bangladeshi candidate on November 1. Out of 10 votes, Nepal’s candidate Dr. Shambhu Acharya secured just two votes against the Bangladeshi candidate Sheikh Hasina Wazed.\n15. COP-28: PM Prachanda left for the COP-28 venue in the UAE on November 28. He returned to Nepal on December 3. He gave his speech on December 3. He was also part of the 52nd National Unity Day and ‘Sayed Sustainability Award’ in the UAE. He had bilateral meetings with the UN Secretary-General and some other world leaders, including Indian PM Modi. The issue of Himalayan glacial melt was one of the notable issues at COP-28.\n16. Italy visit: PM Prachanda visited Italy from July 22 to 28. While in Rome, he participated in the WFO-organized ‘Food System Summit +2.’ During his speech, PM Dahal represented Least Developed Countries (LDC) and emphasized increased agricultural investment. Throughout his stay in Rome, he also conducted bilateral meetings with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, among others.\n17. Qatar: Qatar came into the spotlight of Nepal’s diplomacy for three reasons. First, PM Prachanda’s scheduled and canceled visit on February 27. He was supposed to attend a program of the Fifth Conference of the Least Developed Countries and was set to leave the country on March 3. He canceled his visit on February 27 for ‘important political engagements’ in Nepal. If he had visited Qatar, it would have been his first foreign visit. Second reason of Qatari issues was a possible visit by a high level from the gas-rich Arab country. Third reason was Qatar’s potential to meditate for the release of Nepali student Bipin Joshi from Hamas activity.\n18. Australian Minister visit: Australia’s Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts visited Kathmandu from May 16 to 17. He paid a visit to the Hindu shrine of Pashupatinath. As Australia becomes one of the most favored destinations for Nepali students, more top-level visits between the two countries are expected.\n19. MCC: The American project of MCC was ratified by Nepal’s parliament last year. However, the $500 million project is still in limbo when it comes to visible outcomes. Despite no tangible MCC outcomes for transmission lines and roadways, there were high-level visits from the US, including the February 7 visit of the Administrator of the USAID Samantha Power and the July 13 visit of US Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, among others.\n20. BRF: So far, there are no tangible infrastructural outcomes of Nepal’s participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since the first Belt and Road Forum (BRF) in 2017. However, Nepal was not absent in the Third Belt and Road Forum which was held in Beijing from October 17 to 18. Nepal’s delegation was led by Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha.\n21. Electricity trade with China: While claiming the one-year ‘success’ of his government, PM Prachanda highlighted the first ongoing trans-Himalayan transmission lines between Nepal and China. He stated that works are underway to erect the Chilime-Kerung 220 kV transmission lines. When this comes into operation, it would be an added option for Nepal’s incumbent India-dependent energy trade.\n22. Asian Games and Asia Cup Goodwill: From a sporting perspective, Nepal’s two medals at the Hangzhou Asian Games, praiseworthy cricketing performance against heavyweight cricketing nations at the Asia Cup from August 30 to September 17, and participation in the Asian Games from September 23 to October 8 were noted as part of Nepal’s sporting goodwill.\n23. Nepal’s absence in Raisina Dialogue and G-20 Summit: Two notable physical events in Nepal’s southern neighbor were the Raisina Dialogue, held from March 2 to 4 and supported by the Indian Government, which invited many world leaders but not Nepali representatives. Likewise, in the G-20 summit from September 9 to 10, Nepal was absent among the invitees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"hash":"a15720d8ab34b4a553ddc4aa301651ba62278e700ad08fb9315d919066140a52","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIsrael resumes Gaza assault after rockets fired, heavy fighting reported\t\t\t\t\t","date":"December 1, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","source":"np","link":"https://english.nepalpress.com/2023/12/01/israel-resumes-gaza-assault-after-rockets-fired-heavy-fighting-reported/","imageLink":"https://english.nepalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NYOZQS423FM2XFARY4GXMOVA4Y.jpg","category":null,"content":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsrael resumed combat operations against Hamas in Gaza on Friday after accusing the Palestinian militant group of firing rockets at Israel and reneging on a deal to free all women held as hostages, violating their temporary truce agreement, Reuters reported.\nThe seven-day pause, which began on Nov. 24 and was extended twice, had allowed for the exchange of dozens of hostages held in Gaza for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and facilitated the entry of humanitarian aid into the shattered coastal strip.\nIn the hour before the truce was set to end at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT), Israel said it intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza.\nThere was no immediate comment from Hamas or claim of responsibility for the launch.\n“With the resumption of fighting we emphasise: The Israeli government is committed to achieving the goals of the war – to free our hostages, to eliminate Hamas, and to ensure that Gaza will never pose a threat to the residents of Israel,” the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.\nHamas was also defiant.\n“What Israel did not achieve during the fifty days before the truce, it will not achieve by continuing its aggression after the truce,” Ezzat El Rashq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said on the group’s web site.\nPalestinian media and Gaza’s interior ministry reported Israeli air and artillery strikes across the enclave after the truce expired, including in Rafah, near the border with Egypt.\nIn Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, a Reuters witness said he could hear heavy shelling and see smoke rising in the east of the town.

When viewed superficially, it looks like a horror movie. But when we deeply delve into the plot and conversations, which happened at a very slow pace between the characters, we come to the conclusion that the red suitcase puller [Praveen Khatiwada] was, in fact, a hallucination of a pick-up van driver [Saugat Malla].\nOnly after the movie concludes do we realize that the seed of hallucination began to sprout in Malla’s mind soon after he loaded a coffin with the dead body of a Nepali migrant worker and the red suitcase of the deceased man into his van.\nIn a short scene, we can see a man in a blue jumpsuit with a red suitcase in his hand standing in a bus station. The video is shot in such a way that the viewer can assume he might have taken a vehicle passing by. By the middle of the movie, it becomes clear that he had climbed onto the van driven by Malla. That was Malla’s first hallucination.\nAs he was driving the van on the highway, he listened to a phone-in program on the radio, where he heard a man telling how he saw a mysterious man in a bus station, who vanished all of a sudden. That conversation in the phone-in program was another hallucination of Malla.\nSome people peeped inside his van, suggesting that someone else was there. But Malla didn’t bother to give a look. It is because that too was his hallucination.\nAs the night fell, he went to the hotel which lies by the side of the highway. That hotel happens to be owned by a retired army personnel [Bipin Karki] serving in the Indian army, who offered him liquor and food. The hotel and the host both were Malla’s hallucination. It becomes clearer when we analyze the conversation between Malla and Karki in the light of the happenings by the end of the movie.\nDuring the conversation, Malla said that after seeing the dead body of his teacher Mukti Nath Adhikari, who was murdered in a ruthless way by the Maoist guerrillas, he was deeply traumatized, and it changed the course of his life. He feels very sorry for those Nepali workers who died abroad. He has deep sympathy for the dead bodies. We can infer that such sympathy was a result of his trauma, which had left a deeper scar in his mind after seeing the dead body of his teacher.\nDuring the conversation, he says that he wishes no migrant workers die abroad. It means that he wants to correct their course by making them alive, at least in his imagination. That day too, he must have wanted the dead body inside the coffin to visit his house being alive, along with his red suitcase. Exactly the same scene is shown in the movie. It was another hallucination of Malla.\nDespite Karki’s plea for him to spend the night in his house, Malla insists on sleeping inside the van. By the end of the movie, it becomes clear that the house was abandoned and in a wrecked state. It was in no condition to accommodate him. We can assume that that’s why he slept in the van. Malla said to Karki that spending nights in the van had become his routine as he has to deliver about 20-25 dead bodies of the migrant workers to their relatives every month, and for this, he has to travel the highways almost on a daily basis. It does indicate that he had been hallucinating in a similar way in the past also. That night was just another hallucinating night for him.\nAs a driver with deep sympathy for the dead people who very frequently rides across the highways, it is highly likely that he must be aware of the retired army personnel who had committed suicide. He might have wished him to remain alive. That’s why he made him alive and had a conversation with him in a hallucinating state.\nAs the van reached its destination, Malla opened the coffin. Inside the coffin, there was a dead body wrapped in a blue jumpsuit. As Malla has been delivering dead bodies for a long time, he was aware that the bodies are wrapped in the blue jumpsuit. That’s why he hallucinated the dead body in the blue jumpsuit approaching his home by rolling his red suitcase to meet his dear ones.\nAfter he returns by delivering the dead body, a couple of scenes suggest that he believes in the ghosts. Firstly, he gets off from the van, plucks a branch of a thorny bush, and lays it on the road, suggesting that he believes it blocks the spirit of the dead body from approaching him. After a while, he goes to a river, washes the van, and lights a sacred flame to completely do away with the spirit. Only a person who believes in ghosts is more likely to hallucinate in that way.\nAll these events suggest that The Red Suitcase is a psychological thriller. When you watch the movie and come out of the theater, you will be carrying its deep effect in your mind, which will take at least some weeks to fade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","summary":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKATHMANDU: The Red Suitcase, a movie directed by Fidel Devkota, belongs to the psychological thriller genre. When viewed superficially, it looks like a horror movie. But when we deeply delve into the plot and conversations, which happened at a very slow pace between the characters, we come to the conclusion that the red suitcase puller [Praveen Khatiwada] was, in fact, a hallucination of a pick-up van driver [Saugat Malla].\nOnly after the movie concludes do we realize that the seed of hallucination began to sprout in Malla’s mind soon after he loaded a coffin with the dead body of a Nepali migrant worker and the red suitcase of the deceased man into his van.\nIn a short scene, we can see a man in a blue jumpsuit with a red suitcase in his hand standing in a bus station. The video is shot in such a way that the viewer can assume he might have taken a vehicle passing by. By the middle of the movie, it becomes clear that he had climbed onto the van driven by Malla. That was Malla’s first hallucination.\nAs he was driving the van on the highway, he listened to a phone-in program on the radio, where he heard a man telling how he saw a mysterious man in a bus station, who vanished all of a sudden. That conversation in the phone-in program was another hallucination of Malla.\nSome people peeped inside his van, suggesting that someone else was there. But Malla didn’t bother to give a look. It is because that too was his hallucination.\nAs the night fell, he went to the hotel which lies by the side of the highway. That hotel happens to be owned by a retired army personnel [Bipin Karki] serving in the Indian army, who offered him liquor and food. The hotel and the host both were Malla’s hallucination. It becomes clearer when we analyze the conversation between Malla and Karki in the light of the happenings by the end of the movie.\nDuring the conversation, Malla said that after seeing the dead body of his teacher Mukti Nath Adhikari, who was murdered in a ruthless way by the Maoist guerrillas, he was deeply traumatized, and it changed the course of his life. He feels very sorry for those Nepali workers who died abroad. He has deep sympathy for the dead bodies. We can infer that such sympathy was a result of his trauma, which had left a deeper scar in his mind after seeing the dead body of his teacher.\nDuring the conversation, he says that he wishes no migrant workers die abroad. It means that he wants to correct their course by making them alive, at least in his imagination. That day too, he must have wanted the dead body inside the coffin to visit his house being alive, along with his red suitcase. Exactly the same scene is shown in the movie. It was another hallucination of Malla.\nDespite Karki’s plea for him to spend the night in his house, Malla insists on sleeping inside the van. By the end of the movie, it becomes clear that the house was abandoned and in a wrecked state. It was in no condition to accommodate him. We can assume that that’s why he slept in the van.

Created by Vince Gilligan, the show follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer, and his former student, Jesse Pinkman, as they enter the dangerous world of drugs and crime. Methamphetamine is an amphetamine derivative, trade name Methedrine, used in the form of a crystalline hydrochloride; which is used as a stimulant to the nervous system and as an appetite suppressant.\nThe series is known for its gripping storyline, complex characters, and intense performances. Bryan Cranston portrays Walter White, a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who turns to cooking and selling methamphetamine after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. Aaron Paul plays Jesse Pinkman, a small-time methamphetamine manufacturer and dealer who becomes Walter’s business partner and surrogate son-like figure.\nThroughout the show, Walter and Jesse get involved with various criminal organizations and face numerous challenges as they try to establish their drug empire. The series explores themes of morality, the consequences of choices, and the transformation of its characters.\n“Breaking Bad” received critical acclaim and has been widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time. It won numerous awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards. The show also spawned a prequel spin-off called “Better Call Saul,” which focuses on the character Saul Goodman, who becomes the lawyer for Walter and Jesse in “Breaking Bad.”\nThe essence of the story:\nThe central theme of “Breaking Bad” revolves around the transformation of an ordinary man, Walter White, into a morally compromised and ruthless criminal. The series explores the consequences of Walter’s choices as he descends into the world of drugs and crime.\nOne of the primary themes is the concept of moral ambiguity. Walter starts as a sympathetic character driven by desperation to secure his family’s financial future after being diagnosed with cancer. However, as he becomes more deeply involved in the drug trade, his actions become increasingly questionable and morally reprehensible. The series challenges viewers to examine the boundaries of right and wrong and raises questions about the nature of human morality.\nAnother theme is the consequences of unchecked ambition and the allure of power. Walter’s initial motivations may be rooted in providing for his family, but his journey takes him on a path of power and control. As he gains more influence in the drug trade, he becomes consumed by his ego and the desire for dominance, leading to devastating consequences for those around him.\n“Breaking Bad” also delves into the concept of identity and self-discovery. Walter transforms from a meek and overlooked high school teacher into a notorious drug lord known as Heisenberg. Through this transformation, he explores his own capabilities and confronts his deepest fears and desires. The series highlights how our actions shape our identities and how the pursuit of power can corrupt and distort one’s sense of self.\nFurthermore, “Breaking Bad” touches on the theme of the destructive nature of secrets and lies. Walter’s double life strains his relationships with his family, friends, and associates. His web of lies and deceit creates an atmosphere of tension and paranoia, ultimately leading to devastating consequences for himself and those he cares about.\nThe themes of moral ambiguity, the consequences of ambition, identity, and the destructive power of secrets and lies are intricately woven throughout the narrative of “Breaking Bad.” The series challenges viewers to confront their own moral compass and consider the choices we make when faced with difficult circumstances.\nRiveting character transformation:\n“Breaking Bad” stands as a testament to the power of character transformation within the realm of television. At its core, the series captivates audiences with its exploration of the intricate metamorphosis of its protagonist, Walter White. The transformation of Walter from a meek, law-abiding chemistry teacher to a formidable drug lord named Heisenberg is a master class in character development, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of television storytelling.\nWalter White’s journey begins as a sympathetic figure; a man dealt a harsh blow by life’s circumstances. However, as the series unfolds, we witness a gradual erosion of his moral boundaries. It is this slow descent that makes his transformation all the more compelling. Breaking Bad challenges the viewers’ perceptions of good and evil, forcing them to confront the uncomfortable reality that anyone is capable of straying from the path of righteousness.\nAs Walter delves deeper into the methamphetamine trade, a new persona emerges – Heisenberg. This alter ego represents Walter’s liberation from societal constraints and an embodiment of his repressed desires. Heisenberg embodies power, control, and the audacity to defy conventional norms. Walter’s transformation into Heisenberg highlights the allure of dominance and the intoxicating effects of embracing one’s darker impulses.\nWalter’s transformation raises poignant ethical questions, forcing viewers to confront their own moral compass. Can a man driven by desperation be excused for his descent into criminality? Does the end ever justify the means? “Breaking Bad” navigates these dilemmas with finesse, presenting a complex protagonist whose actions blur the lines between hero and villain. The series challenges our preconceived notions of right and wrong, leaving us pondering the nature of morality long after the final credits roll.\nWhile Walter’s transformation grants him power and a taste of the life he had always desired, it comes at an enormous cost. The collateral damage caused by his choices weighs heavily on the narrative. Relationships fracture, lives are lost, and innocence is irreversibly corrupted. The series reinforces the notion that transformation often exacts a steep toll, underscoring the repercussions of unchecked ambition and the destructive ripple effect of one’s choices.\n“Breaking Bad” masterfully crafts an unforgettable character transformation that transcends the confines of traditional storytelling. Walter White’s evolution from a timid chemistry teacher to a morally compromised drug lord serves as a cautionary tale, provoking profound introspection among viewers. The series highlights the fluid nature of morality, the seduction of power, and the ramifications of embracing one’s darker instincts. Through the lens of Walter White’s journey, “Breaking Bad” has forever reshaped the landscape of character-driven narratives, leaving an indelible mark on the annals of television history.\nIntense storytelling:\nThe storytelling in “Breaking Bad” is undeniably intense and gripping. The series maintains a consistently high level of tension and suspense throughout its run, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. Here’s an exploration of the various elements that contribute to the intense storytelling of “Breaking Bad”:\nPacing: The show expertly balances slow-burning character development with heart-pounding moments of action. The pacing allows for a deep dive into the characters’ motivations and inner struggles, while also building anticipation for explosive confrontations and unexpected twists.\nCharacter-driven narrative: The intense storytelling stems from the compelling and complex characters at the core of the series. Each character is meticulously crafted, with their own motivations, flaws, and arcs. The conflicts that arise between the characters drive the plot forward and create a palpable sense of tension.\nMoral ambiguity: “Breaking Bad” delves into the gray areas of morality, blurring the lines between right and wrong. This moral ambiguity adds an extra layer of intensity to the storytelling as viewers are constantly confronted with the characters’ questionable choices and the consequences that follow.\nHigh-stakes consequences: The decisions made by the characters in “Breaking Bad” often have life-and-death consequences. As the story progresses, the stakes escalate, and the characters find themselves entangled in dangerous situations, facing the risk of exposure, violence, and loss. This constant threat amplifies the intensity of the storytelling.\nEmotional depth: The emotional impact of “Breaking Bad” is a significant aspect of its intensity. The series explores themes of desperation, betrayal, guilt, and the consequences of one’s actions. The emotional turmoil experienced by the characters resonates with viewers, creating an immersive and intense viewing experience.\nCinematic craftsmanship: The technical aspects of the show contribute to its intensity. The cinematography, use of lighting and color, sound design and editing, all work together to create a visually stunning and atmospheric narrative. The attention to detail and the visual cues enhance the emotional impact and heighten the intensity of key moments.\nThe combination of these factors results in an intense storytelling experience that keeps viewers emotionally invested and engaged. “Breaking Bad” is renowned for its ability to create and sustain tension, leaving a lasting impression on its audience.\nLegacy and impact:\nBreaking Bad’s impact on popular culture cannot be overstated. It redefined the possibilities of storytelling on television, paving the way for a new era of complex and character-driven dramas. Its influence can be seen in subsequent series that embraced morally ambiguous protagonists and intricate narrative arcs. Breaking Bad’s iconic moments, such as the “I am the one who knocks” speech and the explosive series finale, have become part of television folklore. The series’s legacy lies not only in its numerous awards and accolades but also in its ability to resonate deeply with audiences worldwide, transcending the medium to become a cultural phenomenon.\nBreaking Bad is a tour-de-force of television storytelling, where each episode unfolds with nail-biting tension and intricate character development. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul delivering career-defining portrayals. Its exploration of morality, ethical dilemmas, and the consequences of choice raises profound questions that linger in the mind long after the series concludes.

This new method of farming is given the term “regenerative agriculture.” As the name goes, the idea behind such a movement is triggered by the need of the farming communities to lower their farm input expenditure, by helping farmers lessen their growing dependency on commercial fertilizers and pesticides, while at the same time able to grow enough food to feed the world’s growing population in a sustainable way.[1]\nThe failure of industrial farming and the search for an alternative model\nIndustrial farming which places heavy reliance on continuous application of external farm inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and inorganically derived chemical pesticides has dominated the agricultural landscape worldwide, more specifically in the western developed nations for more than a century. In its wake, such chemical-intensive ways of food production have left a trail of destruction on major environmental and ecological indicators worldwide, including crisis in human health, while exacerbating degradation of farmland, contamination of water bodies, and loss of biodiversity.[2]\nMany farmers after having practiced and endured chemical-intensive and large scale monocropping with the application of industrial farming methods for decades, seemed to be frustrated with the results, because their soil is giving up, farm productivity is declining, and farmers are not making enough money from agriculture to pay their loans and debts.[3]\nAs the price of factory-manufactured synthetic agricultural inputs has remained uncertain and volatile in the global market with skyrocketing prices of the same in recent times, farming occupation has added an extra layer of burden and mental stress to the farming communities, especially those practicing commercial farming and commodity-based agriculture.[4] This trend is palpable because chemical-intensive agricultural commercialization on larger farms demands huge capital investment from farmers, requiring them to purchase heavy tractors, farm equipment and agricultural machinery, alongside the need to maintain expensive irrigation infrastructure in place. Such capital-intensive farming with considerable initial investment from farmers often tends to overrun or exceed the anticipated economic returns, making such an approach to agriculture less promising and viable.[5,6]\n\nThe quality and nutritional value of food produced from such chemical-intensive monocultures is further questionable on health grounds raising concerns among many consumers and health-conscious souls.[7]\nFurthermore, an overwhelming number of research studies in recent decades have conclusively shown that chemical-intensive agriculture is not only untenable but also unsustainable to meet the growing food demands of the ever-increasing world population.[2,8,9,10] For instance, according to FAO report (2024), 733 million people worldwide are still confronting chronic hunger issues from lack of food, while 2.33 billion people – comprising 29% of the global population are facing food insecurity due to limited food access.[11] Such problems of food shortage and its inaccessibility is often seen in poor communities and among marginalized farmers who either lack the purchasing power to procure food to feed their families or are withheld from land ownership rights to grow their own food, compounded by other factors.[12] As such, the initial promise of industrial agriculture, and its purported ability to grow enough food in large mono-cropped farms to feed the growing human population for helping them overcome chronic food shortage and global hunger problem is fading into oblivion and becoming more unrealistic day by day.[5,8]\nFarming communities worldwide are therefore in search of an alternative pathway of food production and mainstream policy interventions that protects and builds soil, mitigates the negative effects of climate change, safeguards ecosystem function and biodiversity, while providing food access to the economically underprivileged.[13,14]  In other words, such an approach to farming must be regenerative and cost effective both in its philosophical underpinnings and in actual practice.\nThe promise of regenerative agriculture\nOne of the fundamental guiding principles behind the regenerative agricultural movement is that its followers recognize and treats soil as a living ecosystem that needs to be protected and conserved, and not simply an inert matter or medium for growing crops, as has often been misunderstood in the past, more so by the proponents of industrial agriculture enthusiasts. Such revelations about our renewed understanding of soil as a living biological entity have been scientifically proven through numerous research findings by soil microbiologists and allied scholars.[15,16,17] At the very least, regenerative agriculture should not only nurture soil health and protect the greater ecological landscape for the long term, but also should provide enough food for many with equitable access to land ownership, to combat world hunger and supply human nutritional needs.[18]\nThe followers of regenerative agriculture do not limit themselves to only adopting one single farming practice but a suite of land management practices, such as integrated farming, multiple cropping, agroforestry, minimum tillage, plantation of cover crops, permaculture, and other nature-based methods of soil regeneration.[19] The prime objective of regenerative agriculture is to create and nurture healthy soil through accumulation of organic matter and humus, which are the building blocks of life and soil microbial activity. The other promise of regenerative agriculture is its huge potential to combat the impending climate change crisis by its ability to sequester atmospheric carbon and restore it back to earth,[20] to where it originally belongs.\nThis evolving paradigm shift towards finding a better alternative for feeding humanity by remaining within the environmental boundaries and carrying capacity of nature is indispensable for our existence and survival. In view of this reality, the time-tested philosophy and concept of regenerative agriculture has its roots tied to the indigenous people worldviews that holds humans and nature as inseparable life forces, both having a mutual responsibility to nurture each other for its thriving and sustenance.[21] Therefore, the concept of regenerative agriculture is not new. Mimicking mother nature’s inherent grand design that has supported the mutual coexistence of a multitude of biological life forms for eons while sharing a common living space and environment, and interdependent on each other for food and survival, have been the cornerstone for understanding the underlying philosophy behind the regenerative agricultural movement worldwide.[22] In fact, such forms of benign agriculture, either knowingly or unknowingly, have been practiced for centuries by indigenous communities.[21] before the destructive modern industrial farming start to take shape with the false promise of feeding humanity with sufficient food and nutrition.\nIn the context of Nepal, adopting regenerative agricultural principles and practices by the farming communities is even more critical given that the country has only about one-fourth of its total geographical landmass that is considered to be arable land suitable for farming.[23] Several research studies have found that Nepal is already losing topsoil and soil organic matter that can sustain agricultural production at an alarming rate in recent decades.[24,25, 26] This is happening due to the adoption of unsustainable farming practices, aside from natural calamities, rapid urbanization, and other anthropogenic factors.[26] Hence, protection of Nepal’s limited land resource while relentlessly improving its productive potential with best management practices that align with regenerative agriculture’s objective and philosophy is vital for securing the country’s food security both in the short and long term.\nFinal Remarks\nAside from being highly capital-intensive nature of food production with higher risks of failure and diminishing economic returns, the other underlying reason why industrial farming model is losing the interest of farming communities globally is that it has its genesis rooted in maximizing short-term gains only, while disregarding the long-term sustenance of agroecological system[27]  – that often have its ability to self-regulate and thrive.\nIndustrial farming ever since it began its rampage with the high-held promise of maximizing farm yield and feeding the growing human population, start treating agriculture as a profit-maximizing tool by commodifying selective crops and capturing the market share of agricultural products, ultimately leading to the ubiquitous proliferation of ultra-processed foods, excessive consumerism, and waste generation.[28]\nThe proponents of the industrial farming model seemed to have succeeded very well so far in manipulating science through political lobbying and monetary power backed-up by large agricultural corporations.[29] As the industrial agricultural model and its pathway is mostly benefiting the rich and privileged power structure in society at the cost of many undernourished and the poor class, its farming model continue to break apart the natural process of life formation and soil regeneration, that has been perfected by nature for the last 3.7 billion years, when biological life is believed to have marked its origin on planet Earth.[30]\nThe central essence of this article can be summed up with the following message: It is easy to fool people and society, but one cannot fool nature. Nature has its own laws and rules to be obeyed. The underlying philosophy of regenerative agriculture seems to flow with the inherent blueprint and deeply rooted principles of nature and its life force, so it holds a high promise to feed the growing global human population while safeguarding our environment.\n References:\n\nKhangura, Ravjit, et al. “Regenerative agriculture—A literature review on the practices and mechanisms used to improve soil health.” Sustainability3 (2023): 2338.\nTilman, David, et al. “Agricultural sustainability and intensive production practices.” Nature6898 (2002): 671-677.\nKobayshsi-Solomon, Erik. “Conventional Farming is Killing Us and Our Planet” Forbes (2023).

Such capital-intensive farming with considerable initial investment from farmers often tends to overrun or exceed the anticipated economic returns, making such an approach to agriculture less promising and viable.[5,6]\n\nThe quality and nutritional value of food produced from such chemical-intensive monocultures is further questionable on health grounds raising concerns among many consumers and health-conscious souls.[7]\nFurthermore, an overwhelming number of research studies in recent decades have conclusively shown that chemical-intensive agriculture is not only untenable but also unsustainable to meet the growing food demands of the ever-increasing world population.[2,8,9,10] For instance, according to FAO report (2024), 733 million people worldwide are still confronting chronic hunger issues from lack of food, while 2.33 billion people – comprising 29% of the global population are facing food insecurity due to limited food access.[11] Such problems of food shortage and its inaccessibility is often seen in poor communities and among marginalized farmers who either lack the purchasing power to procure food to feed their families or are withheld from land ownership rights to grow their own food, compounded by other factors.[12] As such, the initial promise of industrial agriculture, and its purported ability to grow enough food in large mono-cropped farms to feed the growing human population for helping them overcome chronic food shortage and global hunger problem is fading into oblivion and becoming more unrealistic day by day.[5,8]\nFarming communities worldwide are therefore in search of an alternative pathway of food production and mainstream policy interventions that protects and builds soil, mitigates the negative effects of climate change, safeguards ecosystem function and biodiversity, while providing food access to the economically underprivileged.[13,14]  In other words, such an approach to farming must be regenerative and cost effective both in its philosophical underpinnings and in actual practice.\nThe promise of regenerative agriculture\nOne of the fundamental guiding principles behind the regenerative agricultural movement is that its followers recognize and treats soil as a living ecosystem that needs to be protected and conserved, and not simply an inert matter or medium for growing crops, as has often been misunderstood in the past, more so by the proponents of industrial agriculture enthusiasts. Such revelations about our renewed understanding of soil as a living biological entity have been scientifically proven through numerous research findings by soil microbiologists and allied scholars.[15,16,17] At the very least, regenerative agriculture should not only nurture soil health and protect the greater ecological landscape for the long term, but also should provide enough food for many with equitable access to land ownership, to combat world hunger and supply human nutritional needs.[18]\nThe followers of regenerative agriculture do not limit themselves to only adopting one single farming practice but a suite of land management practices, such as integrated farming, multiple cropping, agroforestry, minimum tillage, plantation of cover crops, permaculture, and other nature-based methods of soil regeneration.[19] The prime objective of regenerative agriculture is to create and nurture healthy soil through accumulation of organic matter and humus, which are the building blocks of life and soil microbial activity. The other promise of regenerative agriculture is its huge potential to combat the impending climate change crisis by its ability to sequester atmospheric carbon and restore it back to earth,[20] to where it originally belongs.\nThis evolving paradigm shift towards finding a better alternative for feeding humanity by remaining within the environmental boundaries and carrying capacity of nature is indispensable for our existence and survival. In view of this reality, the time-tested philosophy and concept of regenerative agriculture has its roots tied to the indigenous people worldviews that holds humans and nature as inseparable life forces, both having a mutual responsibility to nurture each other for its thriving and sustenance.[21] Therefore, the concept of regenerative agriculture is not new. Mimicking mother nature’s inherent grand design that has supported the mutual coexistence of a multitude of biological life forms for eons while sharing a common living space and environment, and interdependent on each other for food and survival, have been the cornerstone for understanding the underlying philosophy behind the regenerative agricultural movement worldwide.[22] In fact, such forms of benign agriculture, either knowingly or unknowingly, have been practiced for centuries by indigenous communities.[21] before the destructive modern industrial farming start to take shape with the false promise of feeding humanity with sufficient food and nutrition.\nIn the context of Nepal, adopting regenerative agricultural principles and practices by the farming communities is even more critical given that the country has only about one-fourth of its total geographical landmass that is considered to be arable land suitable for farming.[23] Several research studies have found that Nepal is already losing topsoil and soil organic matter that can sustain agricultural production at an alarming rate in recent decades.[24,25, 26] This is happening due to the adoption of unsustainable farming practices, aside from natural calamities, rapid urbanization, and other anthropogenic factors.[26] Hence, protection of Nepal’s limited land resource while relentlessly improving its productive potential with best management practices that align with regenerative agriculture’s objective and philosophy is vital for securing the country’s food security both in the short and long term.\nFinal Remarks\nAside from being highly capital-intensive nature of food production with higher risks of failure and diminishing economic returns, the other underlying reason why industrial farming model is losing the interest of farming communities globally is that it has its genesis rooted in maximizing short-term gains only, while disregarding the long-term sustenance of agroecological system[27]  – that often have its ability to self-regulate and thrive.\nIndustrial farming ever since it began its rampage with the high-held promise of maximizing farm yield and feeding the growing human population, start treating agriculture as a profit-maximizing tool by commodifying selective crops and capturing the market share of agricultural products, ultimately leading to the ubiquitous proliferation of ultra-processed foods, excessive consumerism, and waste generation.[28]\nThe proponents of the industrial farming model seemed to have succeeded very well so far in manipulating science through political lobbying and monetary power backed-up by large agricultural corporations.[29] As the industrial agricultural model and its pathway is mostly benefiting the rich and privileged power structure in society at the cost of many undernourished and the poor class, its farming model continue to break apart the natural process of life formation and soil regeneration, that has been perfected by nature for the last 3.7 billion years, when biological life is believed to have marked its origin on planet Earth.[30]\nThe central essence of this article can be summed up with the following message: It is easy to fool people and society, but one cannot fool nature. Nature has its own laws and rules to be obeyed. The underlying philosophy of regenerative agriculture seems to flow with the inherent blueprint and deeply rooted principles of nature and its life force, so it holds a high promise to feed the growing global human population while safeguarding our environment.\n References:\n\nKhangura, Ravjit, et al. “Regenerative agriculture—A literature review on the practices and mechanisms used to improve soil health.” Sustainability3 (2023): 2338.\nTilman, David, et al. “Agricultural sustainability and intensive production practices.” Nature6898 (2002): 671-677.\nKobayshsi-Solomon, Erik. “Conventional Farming is Killing Us and Our Planet” Forbes (2023).

Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape in South Asia, this visit has the potential to redefine Nepal-China relations. However, it is equally important for Nepal to maintain its balanced foreign policy, ensuring that strengthening ties with China does not overshadow its unique and historically significant relationship with India. This state visit to China holds immense promise but also requires careful navigation to avoid the perception that Nepal is aligning slightly with China. Nepal shares with India not only an open border but also deep cultural and historical bonds.\nReluctant India and Prompt China:\nIndian authorities have expressed a preference for Nepal’s Prime Ministers to make start of their foreign visit from India. While this tradition stems from the open border, economic, trade, political, and cultural ties between the two countries, there is no political obligation for this practice. India has traditionally invited Nepal’s new Prime Ministers for a state visit either with congratulations shortly after the formation of new government or within the early hundred days of their tenure. However, this time, no such invitation was extended.\nPrime Minister Oli has already extended invitation to Indian Prime Minister Modi on two separate occasions- first on August 11, during a courtesy meeting, through Indian Foreign Ministry Secretary Vikram Misri and later during a personal meeting with Prime Minister Modi in New York. Although Prime Minister Modi graciously accepted the invitations, a reciprocal invitation for PM Oli’s state visit to India was not issued Iit seems that Modi may have reservations about extending an invitation to new Prime Minister Oli for a state visit to India.  However, India’s delay in extending an invitation raises questions about whether India feels uneasy or strained in its relations with the current coalition government in Nepal. In the absence of an invitation from India, China extended a state visit invitation to Prime Minister Oli, which he accepted, reflecting Nepal’s active engagement in fostering bilateral ties with its northern neighbor. Had an invitation from India been received earlier, obviously, PM Oli’s first state visit would have been to India, in line with past practices. China’s prompt invitation led to the decision for a visit to Beijing first, followed by a visit to Delhi once India extends its invitation. This approach reflects Nepal’s commitment to maintaining balanced relations with its neighbors. So, viewing the visit to the northern neighbor, China, through the lens of Nepal-India relations is superfluous. While the delay in India’s invitation may have led to perceptions of a diplomatic pause, Nepal remains committed to its non-aligned foreign policy. It is vital that this visit to China highlights Nepal’s balanced approach to nurturing strong, cooperative, and equitable relationships with both its northern and southern neighbors.The preparations for a visit to neighboring countries by the Prime Minister of Nepal, an independent and sovereign nation, should be viewed as normal.\n \nNepal’s Dilemma Between MCC and BRI:\nNepal finds itself in a complex diplomatic terrain as it needs to maintain balance relationships with global powers like the United States, India, and China. Despite public resistance, the U.S.-backed Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact was passed through Nepal’s Parliament in 2022 and has reached the implementation stage. In contrast, the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), officially endorsed alongside MCC in 2017, remains stalled, raising concerns about Nepal’s diplomatic equilibrium. Both initiatives were officially endorsed by Nepal in 2017, but the disparity in their progression has sparked debate and tension in Nepal’s foreign policy. India’s and America’s subtle resistance to Nepal’s involvement in the BRI reflects their geopolitical concern to discourage Nepal from advancing BRI projects so as to lessen expanding Chinese influence in the region.  Nepal’s hesitation to engage fully with the BRI may be perceived as favoring one global bloc over the other. To maintain non-aligned foreign policy and uphold strong, balanced relationships with all partners, Nepal must move forward with projects under the BRI, ensuring equitable engagement with both Western and Chinese-led initiatives.\nAmid this backdrop, Prime Minister Oli’s visit to China offers an opportunity to recalibrate Nepal’s foreign policy and strengthen its bilateral relations with its northern neighbor. The visit should focus on addressing Nepal’s commitment to the BRI and exploring avenues for equitable collaboration, ensuring that Nepal’s ties with China are as smooth as those with the U.S. and India. Besides, this visit must provide an opportunity to explore how Nepal can maximize benefits from this initiative while ensuring financial and strategic confidence. By taking decisive steps during this visit, PM Oli can reinforce Nepal’s role as a neutral actor, maintain geopolitical balance, and uphold its non-aligned foreign policy amidst growing global competition. This state visit should focus on utilizing opportunities to strengthen Nepal’s neutral and sovereign stance. It should uphold Nepal’s non-aligned foreign policy. The visit must address the aspirations of both Western and Chinese partners. This approach will help mitigate upheavals in Nepal’s diplomatic relations and reaffirm its commitment to a balanced foreign policy.\nChina’s support under the BRI has the potential to transform Nepal’s infrastructure landscape. Projects such as the ambitious Kerung-Kathmandu railway, the modernization of the Arniko Highway, and the development of border dry ports are to be prioritized as critical components of Nepal’s economic aspirations.\nNepal’s Cautious Position on BRI Financing:\nPM Oli is expected to prioritize securing cautious and favorable financing terms for BRI projects, focusing on grants or soft loans with low interest rates with flexible repayment options. Since Nepal has already been borrowing loans from institutions like the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and EXIM Bank, lower-interest loans under the BRI framework would remain competitive. However, Nepal must remain cautious, learning from the debt challenges faced by Sri Lanka and Pakistan in similar projects and must avoid pitfalls experienced by these nations. By insisting on feasibility studies, cost-benefit analyses, and transparent terms, Nepal can ensure successful projects while protecting its economic sovereignty and long-term interests.\nRevitalizing the Airports for Economic Growth:\nNepal’s aviation infrastructure has seen significant contributions from China, particularly through soft loans. Major airports such as Gautam Buddha International Airport in Lumbini and Pokhara International Airport are notable examples of Chinese-backed projects. However, these airports have faced challenges in operating at full capacity. For instance, Gautam Buddha International Airport, despite its potential to serve as a gateway for Buddhist tourism, struggles with low passenger numbers and inadequate connectivity. Similarly, Pokhara International Airport, inaugurated with high expectations, has yet to attract sufficient international airlines. The underutilization of these airports raises concerns about their ability to generate revenue and repay loans. China has operated some chartered flights at Pokhara Airport, and there have been requests for regular flights, but none are currently operational. With no international flights at the airport, domestic flights alone are insufficient to manage the debt. This visit is expected to result in tangible progress toward alleviating the airport’s financial burden. If efforts to secure a waiver for the nearly 28 billion loans taken from China for the airport’s construction are successful, it would be a significant achievement. If China refuses, citing precedents with other countries, an alternative could be debt relief through grant funding.\nBoosting Tourism and Herbal Production:\nChina is an important market for Nepal’s tourism industry. During PM Oli’s visit, discussions on boosting tourism cooperation could yield significant benefits. Simplifying visa procedures for Chinese tourists, increasing direct flights between major cities, and launching joint promotional campaigns could attract more visitors from China. Additionally, promoting Buddhist heritage sites such as Lumbini as part of cultural tourism circuits can appeal to Chinese tourists interested in Buddhism.\nBeyond tourism, Nepal’s rich biodiversity offers immense potential for collaboration in herbal production. Nepal is home to a wide range of medicinal plants, many of which are in high demand in China’s traditional medicine industry. By partnering with China, Nepal can develop its herbal production and processing capabilities. Establishing joint ventures, setting up research and development centers, and creating export-oriented value chains can transform Nepal’s herbal industry into a significant contributor to its economy. This visit is anticipated to comprehensively address these pressing and significant issues, offering potential solutions and fostering deeper collaboration between China and Nepal.\n Cross-Border Infrastructure:\nPM Oli’s visit is also expected to focus on advancing cross-border infrastructure development, which could transform Nepal’s geographical limitations into a strategic advantage. A key project in this vision is the Kerung-Kathmandu railway, a crucial initiative to connect Nepal’s capital with the Chinese border town of Kerung. This railway could revolutionize trade, tourism, and investment, cutting transportation costs and time. Alongside the railway, upgrading the Arniko Highway and modernizing dry ports like Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi will be essential to enhance trade connectivity with China. Securing financial and technical support from China will be pivotal in realizing these ambitious infrastructure goals, positioning Nepal as a vital trade corridor between China and South Asia. PM Oli’s government must emphasize Nepal’s sovereign and non-aligned foreign policy, which prioritizes national interest above external pressures.\nConclusion: Balanced Ties, Bright Future:\nPM Oli’s government must emphasize Nepal’s sovereign and non-aligned foreign policy, which prioritizes national interest above external pressures. Although tradition dictates that Nepal’s Prime Minister typically makes India the first destination for a state visit, PM Oli’s decision to visit China first marks a significant departure from this norm. This break with tradition highlights Nepal’s sovereignty and independence, reaffirming the country’s long-standing history of maintaining its autonomy and making diplomatic decisions based on its own interests. The move underscores Nepal’s commitment to a balanced foreign policy and reflects its ability to chart its own course in the evolving geopolitical landscape, free from external pressures. By adopting a pragmatic and balanced approach, PM Oli’s visit to China should help position Nepal as a key hub of connectivity and economic activity in South Asia. This engagement with China could mark a new era of progress, prosperity, and balanced international relations for Nepal.","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s scheduled state visit to China from December 2 to December 6 stands as an important turning point in Nepal’s diplomatic and developmental strategy. Against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape in South Asia, this visit has the potential to redefine Nepal-China relations. However, it is equally important for Nepal to maintain its balanced foreign policy, ensuring that strengthening ties with China does not overshadow its unique and historically significant relationship with India. This state visit to China holds immense promise but also requires careful navigation to avoid the perception that Nepal is aligning slightly with China. Nepal shares with India not only an open border but also deep cultural and historical bonds.\nReluctant India and Prompt China:\nIndian authorities have expressed a preference for Nepal’s Prime Ministers to make start of their foreign visit from India. While this tradition stems from the open border, economic, trade, political, and cultural ties between the two countries, there is no political obligation for this practice. India has traditionally invited Nepal’s new Prime Ministers for a state visit either with congratulations shortly after the formation of new government or within the early hundred days of their tenure. However, this time, no such invitation was extended.\nPrime Minister Oli has already extended invitation to Indian Prime Minister Modi on two separate occasions- first on August 11, during a courtesy meeting, through Indian Foreign Ministry Secretary Vikram Misri and later during a personal meeting with Prime Minister Modi in New York. Although Prime Minister Modi graciously accepted the invitations, a reciprocal invitation for PM Oli’s state visit to India was not issued Iit seems that Modi may have reservations about extending an invitation to new Prime Minister Oli for a state visit to India.  However, India’s delay in extending an invitation raises questions about whether India feels uneasy or strained in its relations with the current coalition government in Nepal. In the absence of an invitation from India, China extended a state visit invitation to Prime Minister Oli, which he accepted, reflecting Nepal’s active engagement in fostering bilateral ties with its northern neighbor. Had an invitation from India been received earlier, obviously, PM Oli’s first state visit would have been to India, in line with past practices. China’s prompt invitation led to the decision for a visit to Beijing first, followed by a visit to Delhi once India extends its invitation. This approach reflects Nepal’s commitment to maintaining balanced relations with its neighbors. So, viewing the visit to the northern neighbor, China, through the lens of Nepal-India relations is superfluous. While the delay in India’s invitation may have led to perceptions of a diplomatic pause, Nepal remains committed to its non-aligned foreign policy. It is vital that this visit to China highlights Nepal’s balanced approach to nurturing strong, cooperative, and equitable relationships with both its northern and southern neighbors.The preparations for a visit to neighboring countries by the Prime Minister of Nepal, an independent and sovereign nation, should be viewed as normal.\n \nNepal’s Dilemma Between MCC and BRI:\nNepal finds itself in a complex diplomatic terrain as it needs to maintain balance relationships with global powers like the United States, India, and China. Despite public resistance, the U.S.-backed Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact was passed through Nepal’s Parliament in 2022 and has reached the implementation stage. In contrast, the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), officially endorsed alongside MCC in 2017, remains stalled, raising concerns about Nepal’s diplomatic equilibrium. Both initiatives were officially endorsed by Nepal in 2017, but the disparity in their progression has sparked debate and tension in Nepal’s foreign policy.

Having earned his academic degrees from Nepal and Japan, he has collaborated with other coauthors to write research articles on sloth bear. He was the lead author of the research article titled ‘Habitat occupancy of sloth bear Melursus ursinus in ChitwanNational Park, Nepal’ which was published in Ecology and Evolution journal’s March 2022 issue. Talking to Birat Anupam of Nepal Press, Rajan Prasad Paudel has shared his academic and experimental insights on sloth bears of Nepal and around.\nAmong the various types of bears found in Nepal, you picked sloth bear from Nepal’s southern plains. Why so? \nI was unaware of bears in Nepal for a long time until I started my studies and work in biodiversity research and conservation. During my entire undergraduate and graduate studies, all I learned was about tigers, rhinos, and leopards. I learned how Nepal is a leading example in their preservation, how kings turned from poachers into conservationists, established rhino sanctuaries, and used hunting tigers and rhinos as a diplomatic tool to safeguard their state and their power. Our textbooks, articles, and news are about charismatic species, which many consider cute and attractive. Only when I started my professional work life did I begin to explore more wildlife. I discovered news that while the world focused and rejoiced in recovering the giant panda in China, other carnivore species were declining, and the focus on single-species conservation was insufficient to protect the other associated species’ communities and ecosystems. I was wondering if the same was happening with wildlife in Nepal. While we focus on conserving Tigers in Terai and Him Chituwa in the Himalayas, we might be slowly losing other carnivores like hyena, dholes and small cats and bears.\nAt NTNC, my supervisor, Dr. Naresh Subedi, introduced me to Prof. Tsubota from Japan, who was working on bears. Relatively, there were more groups and researchers working on species other than bears. It provided me with a unique opportunity to explore this species. Asiatic black bears and brown bears were more common in Europe and America, while sloth bears were rare and endemic to the Indian sub-continent and Sri Lanka. Besides this, a few studies were already ongoing on Asiatic black bears. Brown bears in Nepal were only seasonally seen as they stayed in Tibet most of the time. Further, Chure and Terai landscapes were more related to my upbringing, and I was more comfortable working in these landscapes. So I decided to work on sloth bears and  was fortunate enough to receive a MEXT scholarship from the Japanese government to complete my Ph.D.\nSloth bears dwell around Chitwan, Parsa and Bardiya national parks. What sorts of conservation works are going on to their conservation? \nCamera trapping and sign surveys are periodically being carried out in the park, which gives updates on the distribution of bears. This is vital by-catch information for bear conservation. Various conservation actions are being carried out, such as grassland management, but we do not have adequate information if these actions are benefitting bears or harming them. Awareness programs on human-wildlife conflict prevention are being carried out that address the sloth bear issues to some extent. Sloth bear-specific conservation actions are very rare. The conservation of sloth bears is incidental to the preservation of tigers and rhinos. Our conservation actions and priorities have not shifted much in the grounds.\nSloth bears endangered animal. What are the natural and human factors for this? \nGlobally and nationally, the population and its habitats are shrinking, which is the leading cause for its vulnerability. The major anthropogenic causes are habitat loss due to the expansion of agriculture, settlement, and developmental infrastructures. Sloth bears are the topmost species facing the greatest road expansion impact in South Asia. The capture of bear cubs and brutal training by tribal communities to use them as dancing bears for street entertainment used to be one of the major threats. Still, bears are killed for their bile, and there are other superstitions related to bears and their parts consumption that trigger poaching. Further, humans frequently enter the forests to collect wild fruits, honey, and other forest resources that disturb sloth bear habitat.\nSloth bears have existed in small and isolated patches. Continuous breeding among related individuals leads to the deterioration of genetic health, ultimately contributing to a decline in their fitness to survive. Sloth bear habitat across their range is experiencing changing land use, land cover, and climate. With changing temperature and precipitation regimes, vegetation structure and composition change, and plants and insects shift their distribution range, directly impacting sloth bears. Changing water tables, decreasing grassland habitats, and increasing invasive species may also impact sloth bears. Tigers are the only potential predators of sloth bears. An increase in the tiger population across their distribution range may have caused a decline in the sloth bear population.\nTermite, honey and wild fruits are major foods for sloth bears. It doesn’t eat meat by hunting. Still, there are reports of bear-human conflicts. Why such events are occurring? \nUnlike other omnivore bears, sloth bears have more insectivorous and seasonally frugivores. They do not kill to eat meat, but still, the conflict is occurring. We should be clear that in most cases (except some man-eater tigers), animals do not consider humans as natural prey, and they do not intend to kill or attack unless they feel threatened and feel the need to defend themselves.\nThe majority of human-sloth bear conflicts result in serious or minor injury to humans involved. These conflicts occur because many humans living around the park frequently visit the park for collection of forest resources, during which sudden encounters with bears lead to injuries and fatalities. Human casualties are the dominant form of human-sloth bear conflict, accounting for more than 95% of all recorded conflict cases. Livestock loss accounted for less than 5 % of the total cases of human-sloth bear conflict in Chitwan.\nMost conflicts with sloth bears occur when people are not alert enough and are engaged in activities like collecting wild vegetables, fodder, and fuelwood. Attacks occur due to poor visibility and high shrub cover along forest paths. Another reason is that sloth bears are naturally aggressive, and their aggressiveness increases during their reproduction and when females have cubs. The majority of attacks occur when a female tries to defend their cubs. Many victims (>60%) say that when the bear attacked them, they saw more than one bear in the area. As habitats have become fragmented and the population around parks is increasing, there are frequent encounters between bears and humans. Since there are no strict fences or boundaries between the park and human agriculture, land bears often venture outside of the park boundary. The migration of youth and the increasing trend of leaving barren lands may have further facilitated the movement of bears outside their core area and increased the chances of encounters and conflicts.\nSloth bears are found in Nepal, India and Sri Lanka. However, in the global discourse of sloth bear, India is mentioned most of the time. Why so? \nPioneer academic research and information on sloth ecology and behavior ear was done in Nepal in the late 70s by Laurie and Seidensticker and in the late 90s by Joshi and Garshelis. Many authors acknowledge this information on sloth bears from Nepal. However, there have been very few follow-up studies in Nepal compared to India. The media covered Sloth bears, and their appearance in the jungle book as Baloo popularized it as a product of India. Further, many sloth bears kept in zoos outside have been taken from India, popularizing it as occurring in India. Sloth bears were first described from India, and most of the distribution range and population is in India. In addition, this may also be driven by the strong scientific institutions backed up by India’s high political and economic influencing status.\nSloth bear carries baby in its back for almost seven to nine months something akin to kangaroo. Female sloth bear expecting baby stays in cave. Sloth bear doesn’t have teeth in its front. Besides, what are the other interesting features of sloth bears? \nIndeed, if we look closely at nature, we will see many fascinating and unique things. Generally, all the bear species are considered omnivores, but sloth bears have a unique feeding habit. It’s fascinating to know that the giant body of sloth bears results from consuming tiny little insects, mostly termites and ants. My study found that 90% of its diet comprises termites and ants. How many numbers of termites and ants would a bear consume in a month, can you imagine? Their nose has few hairs and it can open and close the nostrils as needed to help keep the insects crawling up inside the nose while slurping the ants and termites. Other than insects, they love to eat wild fruits. They are said to get intoxicated by consuming fruits like Mauha, similar to that of African elephants getting drunk by feeding on Marula fruits. They do not hunt to eat meat as other carnivores like tigers or leopards. But there was an interesting case of a sloth bear killing around 90 goats in Madi Valley, Chitwan. Such behavior is rare. A few times sloth bears are reported to consume carrion left by other predators. They are very good climbers and love to eat honey. Infantiside is often common in bears, and reported for sloth bears.\nSloth bear has average age of 40 and average weight of 80. Few months ago, while talking to journalists at Sauraha of Chitwan, you had talked about tourism potential of sloth bear in Nepal something similar to what Australia is doing from Kangaroo. How can we add tourism value to the sloth bear? \nThe Australian government is very strict about preserving its native flora and fauna. Kangaroos and koalas are very popular and promoted as symbols of Australia. The distribution, habitat, and behaviors of these species have been very well understood, and their unique features have been promoted in the tourism industry. Tourists can go on a Kangaroo safari, walk in the bushes to see Kangaroos or visit parks, rescue centers, and zoos where they have been kept in almost natural habitats. Sloth Bear provides a similar avenue for reaping benefits from nature-based tourism. Hotspots of sloth bear movements and den sites should be identified, and sloth bear trails should be located. Nature guides and tourism entrepreneurs should promote sloth bear viewing, walking, tracking, and other innovative ideas as tourism products. I have seen tourists satisfied after viewing sloth bears, even if they have not seen other wildlife. Injured, conflict-causing bears can be kept in a bear sanctuary and promoted as an educational and tourism center. Diversification of tourism services, innovative ideas and entrepreneurship is essential. Sloth Bear can boost nature-based tourism potential like kangaroo of Australia. Promoting sloth bear tourism would help spread the benefits of tourism beyond Chitwan for communities along the Churia landscape. I think this will take good investment and time. Current investment on sloth bears conservation is almost nil, very unsatisfactory. Its conservation is incidental to conservation efforts undertaken for other species like tigers and rhinos. Sloth bears need to be brought out of the shadow of tiger conservation.\nWhat are climate-related impacts on sloth bear? \nExact evidence of climate change impacts on sloth bears is unavailable as there have been limited studies. However, ample evidence suggests climate change impacts other bear species, such as the decline in ice cover and melting ice impact polar bears. Sloth bear habitats are expected to be affected by climate change. Grassland habitats are shrinking, and the impact of the spread of invasive species is increasing. Similarly, there are few specific studies on bear-specific fruit trees, but these are likely to shift their distribution ranges and fruiting timings. Similarly, the availability and abundance of termites and ants may change in response to changing temperature and moisture regimes. Modeling their occurrence in different scenarios of changing climate shows that their current protected area boundary may not be adequate to conserve sloth bears. More suitable habitats would be outside this PA boundary, where they must tackle increasing human pressure. Hibernation in bears is triggered by environmental cues; as climate warms and the weather becomes unpredictable, this behavior may change. Although sloth bears are not true hibernators, changing climate can impact their denning behavior. Sloth bears may go late into their dens and emerge faster and spend more time moving. Climate change-induced human-bear conflicts may rise in the future.\nLastly, anything you want to add? \nFor many households living near the forest, bears are a threat. I want to remember and thank all the parks staff, forest rangers, and community leaders who continuously work at the grassroots to minimize these threats, create opportunities for local communities, and promote harmonious human-wildlife co-existence.","summary":"KATHMANDU :  Rajan Prasad Paudel is Nepal’s noted researcher on sloth bear. Having earned his academic degrees from Nepal and Japan, he has collaborated with other coauthors to write research articles on sloth bear. He was the lead author of the research article titled ‘Habitat occupancy of sloth bear Melursus ursinus in ChitwanNational Park, Nepal’ which was published in Ecology and Evolution journal’s March 2022 issue. Talking to Birat Anupam of Nepal Press, Rajan Prasad Paudel has shared his academic and experimental insights on sloth bears of Nepal and around.\nAmong the various types of bears found in Nepal, you picked sloth bear from Nepal’s southern plains. Why so? \nI was unaware of bears in Nepal for a long time until I started my studies and work in biodiversity research and conservation. During my entire undergraduate and graduate studies, all I learned was about tigers, rhinos, and leopards. I learned how Nepal is a leading example in their preservation, how kings turned from poachers into conservationists, established rhino sanctuaries, and used hunting tigers and rhinos as a diplomatic tool to safeguard their state and their power. Our textbooks, articles, and news are about charismatic species, which many consider cute and attractive. Only when I started my professional work life did I begin to explore more wildlife. I discovered news that while the world focused and rejoiced in recovering the giant panda in China, other carnivore species were declining, and the focus on single-species conservation was insufficient to protect the other associated species’ communities and ecosystems. I was wondering if the same was happening with wildlife in Nepal. While we focus on conserving Tigers in Terai and Him Chituwa in the Himalayas, we might be slowly losing other carnivores like hyena, dholes and small cats and bears.\nAt NTNC, my supervisor, Dr. Naresh Subedi, introduced me to Prof. Tsubota from Japan, who was working on bears. Relatively, there were more groups and researchers working on species other than bears. It provided me with a unique opportunity to explore this species. Asiatic black bears and brown bears were more common in Europe and America, while sloth bears were rare and endemic to the Indian sub-continent and Sri Lanka. Besides this, a few studies were already ongoing on Asiatic black bears. Brown bears in Nepal were only seasonally seen as they stayed in Tibet most of the time.

Dr. Sharma is a leading expert in the field of sustainable and regenerative agriculture, as well as regional planning. Dr. Sharma has a Ph.D. in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, U.S.A. His doctoral study primarily focused on adopting sustainable agricultural practices by farming communities using socio-psychological behavioral theories and mixed research methods. He also holds two master’s degrees, one in Regional Development Planning from the prestigious SPRING program jointly offered by the University of Dortmund, Germany & University of the Philippines, Quezon City, and the other in Anthropology from Tribhuvan University (T.U.), Nepal. Having also acquired his primary bachelor’s degree in agriculture from T. U. Rampur campus in Chitwan, with nearly two decades of experience serving at a senior position in the Nepalese Government at various capacities in the Department of Agriculture and its wings, Dr. Sharma has some rich perspectives and ideas to share on Nepalese farming that could be beneficial to our nationwide readers, policymakers, and people abroad.\nExcerpts: \nBased on your rich experience working with the farming communities of Nepal spanning two decades, and serving as a senior extension official in the Department of Agriculture in the past, where do you think the problem lies when it comes to making agriculture a sustainable source of livelihood and income for Nepalese farmers?\nAgriculture has stood as the backbone of Nepalese economy for decades, still contributing almost one-fourth chunk of its GDP, however Nepalese farmers for the most part have hardly got the opportunity to rise above the subsistence level, when it comes to diversifying their income from agriculture. At least 80% of Nepal’s 19.5 million farming population are still bordering the poverty line and struggling to make their ends meet from agriculture. These farming communities are constantly faced with the challenge of reconciling their economic needs with farming as their principal source of income and livelihood support on the one hand, while protecting the productive capacity of their farmlands, on the other. These farmers need a clear roadmap of farming practices that they need to undertake which could not only support their farming occupation and livelihoods in the long term, but also safeguards their farmland against major environmental stressors such as the unfolding climate change crisis and unpredictable weather patterns posing considerable risks to subsistence-based farming. Nepalese farmers are often confronted to cope with prolonged droughts in some regions of the country, while navigating their lives with unforeseen precipitation in other parts, often resulting in flash floods and landslides, a major contributor of farmland degradation arising from topsoil loss and erosion.\nNepal have consistently lacked in bridging the polices and implementation gap over the years with regards to production increment of major cereal crops such as rice, wheat and maize including other cash crops, while protecting the environment, farmers’ wellbeing, and human health at the same time. The main problem in Nepalese agriculture lies in prioritizing resources to address the symptoms of the problems without addressing its underlying cause. I believe that agriculture in Nepal could reach to newer heights if we start to focus on the right polices and actions based on our rich ecological niche, varying climatic zones, and align human and financial resources accordingly to uplift the farming population with economic opportunities and technological access. However, at this point, it seems that the government and its partners are misguided over several decades by focusing resources and efforts in production and productivity enhancement of cereals, cash crops, and vegetables through forcibly carving a one-size-fits-all “commercialization of agriculture” bandwagon, through over-reliance and dependency on imported commercial fertilizers and pesticides. Such an approach to food production and poverty reduction has not served us well in the past, and therefore needs to change for the better.\n\nI think it would be more prudent to convey message to the farming communities in first prioritizing the protection of topsoil and conservation of its agricultural biodiversity through the widescale adoption of regenerative and sustainable farming practices applying time-tested agro-ecological principles. I firmly believe adoption of such an approach will yield sustainable and rewarding results in the long term. To accomplish this, the government and its partners need to provide farmers with the resources, tools, and needed support through grants, subsidies, and training along this direction. Although government policy documents hinted at striving to reach food self-sufficiency for its people, I seriously doubt this coveted goal could be achieved in the foreseeable future without first addressing the topsoil loss from erosion, and agrobiodiversity issue, which unfortunately are on a declining trend in Nepalese farming context.\nWhy conservation of topsoil is important in the context of Nepalese agriculture? Can you elaborate further?  \nGeologically, Nepal’s landmass is crafted and shaped from the constant collision of the tectonic plates underneath the Himalayas and is relatively young, as per scientific studies. As such, the topography of Nepal is a fragile landscape with mountains, hills, and terai cascading and overlapping in regions with varying relief features and climatic niches. Only one-fifth of the landmass of Nepal is arable land, capable of supporting farming. The rest of the country’s landmass comprised of sloping lands with rivers, valleys, gorges, and steep mountainous terrain. Since farmland is a scarce resource in Nepal, with average agricultural landholding of only 0.55 hectares, therefore, protection of this limited cultivable land is vital for ensuring food security for its 29.6 million population growing annually at 1.7%. Being a fragile and sloping topography especially in the Mid-hills and Churia (Siwalik) range, where agriculture is practiced by rural communities as the main source of livelihood support, Nepal’s farmland in this region is often prone to severe topsoil loss from erosion and landslides especially during the monsoon season.\nAccording to one recent study, Nepal is losing topsoil at an exceedingly high rate ranging from 11.2 tons per hectare up to 64 tons per hectare. When topsoil is lost at such an alarming rate, the capacity of the land to produce food and fiber for supporting people’s livelihood is compromised both in the short and long term. This is because topsoil is rich in organic matter, which often takes decades and centuries to form under the natural process and is the very essence of life-support system that provides resilience and sustainability to farmlands. Furthermore, the topsoil that is eroded from the hilly and mountainous region carrying huge amounts of silt and clay during the monsoon overwhelms the river system and farmlands in terai causing inundation, loss of crop production from sedimentation deposits, and displacement of farm families. On top of that, loss of lives and property from landslides and soil erosion is a regular phenomenon repeating every year in Nepal. Such natural calamities impose a significant burden on the national treasury in managing reparations, damages, and losses. It is evident that all these issues and problems are interconnected. Therefore, conservation of topsoil is critical for Nepal from the perspective of the country’s food security, protection of its rich agrobiodiversity, and building socio-economic resilience.\nCan you throw some light regarding agrobiodiversity decline in general and the case of Nepal in particular? How did this happen, and what should be done to address such an issue? \nAgrobiodiversity is the richness of genetic diversity of crops, seeds, and species of edible plants and other living organisms in a geographic region that are harbored by nature through generations following the natural selection process. Most of the plant agrobiodiversity available in nature comprises of different genus and species of crops and their cultivars that are open-pollinated. In other words, farmers can save the seeds of these open-pollinated crops for the next growing season. Agrobiodiversity decline occurs from multiple factors that includes both natural and anthropogenic. In the Nepalese context, when topsoil is lost through erosion or agricultural lands are converted into human settlements, which is already happening since the last several decades due to rapid urban sprawl in the country, a lot of the agrobiodiversity that was inherent within those landscapes is also lost in the process. Simultaneously, when farmers start to relinquish their open-pollinated crop cultivars and begin cultivating hybrid varieties on their farmlands for a few generations, then agrobiodiversity loss occurs rapidly. This happens because open-pollinated crops start to lose their viability to procreate if their seeds are not planted by farmers for a few years.\nThe practice of widescale monocropping with the advent of modern industrial farming, especially in developed countries, and subsequent upscaling of such monocultural practices in our part of the world, has also resulted in a significant loss of agrobiodiversity from farmlands. Once agrobiodiversity is lost from nature, it is gone forever. As per one recent study, out of 24,300 total species of agricultural genetic resources available in Nepal, the country has lost close to 40% of those species so far, and the trend of agrobiodiversity loss is worsening every year.\nNepal is not the only country that is facing the agrobiodiversity crisis, it is a global phenomenon, posing some dire consequences for the human species and the planet’s future. The best way to minimize or halt agrobiodiversity loss is through seed savings and conservation of genetic diversity by individual farmers and groups through farm diversification and by establishment of community seed banks. The government initiated National seed bank, for instance the one currently existing in Kathmandu valley under the management of National Agricultural Research Council, should be the last resort of hope toward seed conservation, because the cost of maintaining such a facility in terms of manpower, energy requirement, and resources is huge. Nevertheless, Nepal needs at least a couple of such seed banks in times of emergency. However, at this point, farmers and citizens awareness and actions toward promoting community seed banks is therefore the least costly and viable option for safeguarding against agrobiodiversity loss both in the case of Nepal and globally for ensuring food security for the current and future generations.\nWhat types of currently adopted agricultural practices and other development trends in Nepal are detrimental to safeguarding its long-term agricultural sustainability? \nWe have seen farming communities in Nepal growing annual crops like corn and millet even in sloping lands without proper terracing, resulting in a heavy loss of topsoil from erosion and landslides every year. The phenomena of topsoil loss are very much visible in sloping terraces especially after the heavy monsoon rains. This has resulted in degradation of farming landscapes with severe decline in soil productivity and its functionality over the years. The government needs to carve policies and actions that prohibit annual crop farming in high sloping lands while providing subsidies and motivating farmers to grow perennial grasses, forages, fodders, fruit trees, and shrubs as well as a combination of various conservation practices in steep and semi-steep slopes. Adoption of such a policy would result in protection of vulnerable and erodible landscapes, especially in the Mid- and High-hill regions against soil erosion and landslides, following heavy downpour especially in the monsoon season.\nAnother disturbing trend often observed in Nepal is the rapid conversion of its prime agricultural land into urban settlements and towns without consideration of its inherent land use potential and the capacity of such lands to support agricultural production and food security both in the long and short term. For example, as reported in one recent research study published in 2023, about 25% of the agricultural land in Kathmandu valley had been converted to urban settlements during the 10-year period from 2011-2021. Such development trend is often short-sighted and could result in unpredictability in food supply and long-term scarcity of food for the rapidly growing country’s population. Since Nepal is already a heavy importer of grains, pulses and other essential food commodities from its neighbors like India, China and other food exporters, what we have witnessed over several decades is that Nepal is reeling under an ever-increasing import-export imbalance and trade deficit. As such, it has become a moral imperative for Nepal to protect its prime agricultural land in the form of a regulated and sustainable land use policy to ensure its food security.\nWhat broad policy recommendations do you have for the Government of Nepal to make Nepalese agriculture sustainable and resilient? \nSome broad policy changes I would suggest for Nepal is to divest resources from commercial fertilizers and chemical pesticides importation and instead invest it in sustainable and regenerative agriculture both at the farm and landscape level. The government should provide substantial resources and technical support to the farming communities for motivating them in adopting a sustainable agricultural pathway. Given the vulnerability of its population already facing food insecurity especially in the remote regions, the widely used catchphrase “commercialization of agriculture” in the Nepalese context, may have been sending the wrong message to the farming communities. Farmers may connote this message to simply boost food production by adopting all available means of production, even though they are unsustainable. The main goal of a sustainable agricultural system should not be to only boost food production and sell it in the market for short-term economic return. Nepal must instead make every effort to train farmers and community members to produce food locally by building soil health and conserving its limited land resources to reach food self-sufficiency, without relying on synthetic fertilizers and agrochemicals.

Dr. Sharma is a leading expert in the field of sustainable and regenerative agriculture, as well as regional planning. Dr. Sharma has a Ph.D. in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, U.S.A. His doctoral study primarily focused on adopting sustainable agricultural practices by farming communities using socio-psychological behavioral theories and mixed research methods. He also holds two master’s degrees, one in Regional Development Planning from the prestigious SPRING program jointly offered by the University of Dortmund, Germany & University of the Philippines, Quezon City, and the other in Anthropology from Tribhuvan University (T.U.), Nepal. Having also acquired his primary bachelor’s degree in agriculture from T. U. Rampur campus in Chitwan, with nearly two decades of experience serving at a senior position in the Nepalese Government at various capacities in the Department of Agriculture and its wings, Dr. Sharma has some rich perspectives and ideas to share on Nepalese farming that could be beneficial to our nationwide readers, policymakers, and people abroad.\nExcerpts: \nBased on your rich experience working with the farming communities of Nepal spanning two decades, and serving as a senior extension official in the Department of Agriculture in the past, where do you think the problem lies when it comes to making agriculture a sustainable source of livelihood and income for Nepalese farmers?\nAgriculture has stood as the backbone of Nepalese economy for decades, still contributing almost one-fourth chunk of its GDP, however Nepalese farmers for the most part have hardly got the opportunity to rise above the subsistence level, when it comes to diversifying their income from agriculture. At least 80% of Nepal’s 19.5 million farming population are still bordering the poverty line and struggling to make their ends meet from agriculture. These farming communities are constantly faced with the challenge of reconciling their economic needs with farming as their principal source of income and livelihood support on the one hand, while protecting the productive capacity of their farmlands, on the other. These farmers need a clear roadmap of farming practices that they need to undertake which could not only support their farming occupation and livelihoods in the long term, but also safeguards their farmland against major environmental stressors such as the unfolding climate change crisis and unpredictable weather patterns posing considerable risks to subsistence-based farming. Nepalese farmers are often confronted to cope with prolonged droughts in some regions of the country, while navigating their lives with unforeseen precipitation in other parts, often resulting in flash floods and landslides, a major contributor of farmland degradation arising from topsoil loss and erosion.\nNepal have consistently lacked in bridging the polices and implementation gap over the years with regards to production increment of major cereal crops such as rice, wheat and maize including other cash crops, while protecting the environment, farmers’ wellbeing, and human health at the same time. The main problem in Nepalese agriculture lies in prioritizing resources to address the symptoms of the problems without addressing its underlying cause. I believe that agriculture in Nepal could reach to newer heights if we start to focus on the right polices and actions based on our rich ecological niche, varying climatic zones, and align human and financial resources accordingly to uplift the farming population with economic opportunities and technological access. However, at this point, it seems that the government and its partners are misguided over several decades by focusing resources and efforts in production and productivity enhancement of cereals, cash crops, and vegetables through forcibly carving a one-size-fits-all “commercialization of agriculture” bandwagon, through over-reliance and dependency on imported commercial fertilizers and pesticides. Such an approach to food production and poverty reduction has not served us well in the past, and therefore needs to change for the better.\n\nI think it would be more prudent to convey message to the farming communities in first prioritizing the protection of topsoil and conservation of its agricultural biodiversity through the widescale adoption of regenerative and sustainable farming practices applying time-tested agro-ecological principles. I firmly believe adoption of such an approach will yield sustainable and rewarding results in the long term. To accomplish this, the government and its partners need to provide farmers with the resources, tools, and needed support through grants, subsidies, and training along this direction. Although government policy documents hinted at striving to reach food self-sufficiency for its people, I seriously doubt this coveted goal could be achieved in the foreseeable future without first addressing the topsoil loss from erosion, and agrobiodiversity issue, which unfortunately are on a declining trend in Nepalese farming context.\nWhy conservation of topsoil is important in the context of Nepalese agriculture? Can you elaborate further?  \nGeologically, Nepal’s landmass is crafted and shaped from the constant collision of the tectonic plates underneath the Himalayas and is relatively young, as per scientific studies. As such, the topography of Nepal is a fragile landscape with mountains, hills, and terai cascading and overlapping in regions with varying relief features and climatic niches. Only one-fifth of the landmass of Nepal is arable land, capable of supporting farming. The rest of the country’s landmass comprised of sloping lands with rivers, valleys, gorges, and steep mountainous terrain. Since farmland is a scarce resource in Nepal, with average agricultural landholding of only 0.55 hectares, therefore, protection of this limited cultivable land is vital for ensuring food security for its 29.6 million population growing annually at 1.7%. Being a fragile and sloping topography especially in the Mid-hills and Churia (Siwalik) range, where agriculture is practiced by rural communities as the main source of livelihood support, Nepal’s farmland in this region is often prone to severe topsoil loss from erosion and landslides especially during the monsoon season.\nAccording to one recent study, Nepal is losing topsoil at an exceedingly high rate ranging from 11.2 tons per hectare up to 64 tons per hectare. When topsoil is lost at such an alarming rate, the capacity of the land to produce food and fiber for supporting people’s livelihood is compromised both in the short and long term. This is because topsoil is rich in organic matter, which often takes decades and centuries to form under the natural process and is the very essence of life-support system that provides resilience and sustainability to farmlands. Furthermore, the topsoil that is eroded from the hilly and mountainous region carrying huge amounts of silt and clay during the monsoon overwhelms the river system and farmlands in terai causing inundation, loss of crop production from sedimentation deposits, and displacement of farm families. On top of that, loss of lives and property from landslides and soil erosion is a regular phenomenon repeating every year in Nepal. Such natural calamities impose a significant burden on the national treasury in managing reparations, damages, and losses. It is evident that all these issues and problems are interconnected. Therefore, conservation of topsoil is critical for Nepal from the perspective of the country’s food security, protection of its rich agrobiodiversity, and building socio-economic resilience.\nCan you throw some light regarding agrobiodiversity decline in general and the case of Nepal in particular? How did this happen, and what should be done to address such an issue? \nAgrobiodiversity is the richness of genetic diversity of crops, seeds, and species of edible plants and other living organisms in a geographic region that are harbored by nature through generations following the natural selection process. Most of the plant agrobiodiversity available in nature comprises of different genus and species of crops and their cultivars that are open-pollinated. In other words, farmers can save the seeds of these open-pollinated crops for the next growing season. Agrobiodiversity decline occurs from multiple factors that includes both natural and anthropogenic. In the Nepalese context, when topsoil is lost through erosion or agricultural lands are converted into human settlements, which is already happening since the last several decades due to rapid urban sprawl in the country, a lot of the agrobiodiversity that was inherent within those landscapes is also lost in the process. Simultaneously, when farmers start to relinquish their open-pollinated crop cultivars and begin cultivating hybrid varieties on their farmlands for a few generations, then agrobiodiversity loss occurs rapidly. This happens because open-pollinated crops start to lose their viability to procreate if their seeds are not planted by farmers for a few years.\nThe practice of widescale monocropping with the advent of modern industrial farming, especially in developed countries, and subsequent upscaling of such monocultural practices in our part of the world, has also resulted in a significant loss of agrobiodiversity from farmlands. Once agrobiodiversity is lost from nature, it is gone forever. As per one recent study, out of 24,300 total species of agricultural genetic resources available in Nepal, the country has lost close to 40% of those species so far, and the trend of agrobiodiversity loss is worsening every year.\nNepal is not the only country that is facing the agrobiodiversity crisis, it is a global phenomenon, posing some dire consequences for the human species and the planet’s future. The best way to minimize or halt agrobiodiversity loss is through seed savings and conservation of genetic diversity by individual farmers and groups through farm diversification and by establishment of community seed banks. The government initiated National seed bank, for instance the one currently existing in Kathmandu valley under the management of National Agricultural Research Council, should be the last resort of hope toward seed conservation, because the cost of maintaining such a facility in terms of manpower, energy requirement, and resources is huge. Nevertheless, Nepal needs at least a couple of such seed banks in times of emergency. However, at this point, farmers and citizens awareness and actions toward promoting community seed banks is therefore the least costly and viable option for safeguarding against agrobiodiversity loss both in the case of Nepal and globally for ensuring food security for the current and future generations.\nWhat types of currently adopted agricultural practices and other development trends in Nepal are detrimental to safeguarding its long-term agricultural sustainability? \nWe have seen farming communities in Nepal growing annual crops like corn and millet even in sloping lands without proper terracing, resulting in a heavy loss of topsoil from erosion and landslides every year. The phenomena of topsoil loss are very much visible in sloping terraces especially after the heavy monsoon rains. This has resulted in degradation of farming landscapes with severe decline in soil productivity and its functionality over the years. The government needs to carve policies and actions that prohibit annual crop farming in high sloping lands while providing subsidies and motivating farmers to grow perennial grasses, forages, fodders, fruit trees, and shrubs as well as a combination of various conservation practices in steep and semi-steep slopes. Adoption of such a policy would result in protection of vulnerable and erodible landscapes, especially in the Mid- and High-hill regions against soil erosion and landslides, following heavy downpour especially in the monsoon season.\nAnother disturbing trend often observed in Nepal is the rapid conversion of its prime agricultural land into urban settlements and towns without consideration of its inherent land use potential and the capacity of such lands to support agricultural production and food security both in the long and short term. For example, as reported in one recent research study published in 2023, about 25% of the agricultural land in Kathmandu valley had been converted to urban settlements during the 10-year period from 2011-2021. Such development trend is often short-sighted and could result in unpredictability in food supply and long-term scarcity of food for the rapidly growing country’s population. Since Nepal is already a heavy importer of grains, pulses and other essential food commodities from its neighbors like India, China and other food exporters, what we have witnessed over several decades is that Nepal is reeling under an ever-increasing import-export imbalance and trade deficit. As such, it has become a moral imperative for Nepal to protect its prime agricultural land in the form of a regulated and sustainable land use policy to ensure its food security.\nWhat broad policy recommendations do you have for the Government of Nepal to make Nepalese agriculture sustainable and resilient? \nSome broad policy changes I would suggest for Nepal is to divest resources from commercial fertilizers and chemical pesticides importation and instead invest it in sustainable and regenerative agriculture both at the farm and landscape level. The government should provide substantial resources and technical support to the farming communities for motivating them in adopting a sustainable agricultural pathway. Given the vulnerability of its population already facing food insecurity especially in the remote regions, the widely used catchphrase “commercialization of agriculture” in the Nepalese context, may have been sending the wrong message to the farming communities. Farmers may connote this message to simply boost food production by adopting all available means of production, even though they are unsustainable. The main goal of a sustainable agricultural system should not be to only boost food production and sell it in the market for short-term economic return. Nepal must instead make every effort to train farmers and community members to produce food locally by building soil health and conserving its limited land resources to reach food self-sufficiency, without relying on synthetic fertilizers and agrochemicals. Research and efforts by farming communities from around the world have shown that reaching food self-sufficiency is not a distant dream if regenerative agricultural practices are adopted with a land conservation and stewardship mindset.\nFurthermore, Nepal urgently needs to curb unregulated infiltration of banned pesticides and agro-chemicals from its porous southern border. This could be achieved by strictly regulating its Plant Quarantine check posts at border points while revamping its monitoring and supervision capacities. Raising increased awareness among the farming communities and providing them the tools and resources needed in adopting sustainable practices on their farms is another viable way to tackle this issue in the long-term.\nAlongside, Nepal should massively invest its resources and efforts in regreening barren landscapes and degraded farmlands with afforestation by applying time-tested agroforestry principles and techniques. The end-goal should be to create a functional agricultural landscape and food forest where nature, people and biodiversity thrive together in perpetuity."},{"hash":"19015f1901b181346aa823f91670dc5f16bfeeebb44b6492d55b1ce3cc2aabbf","title":"WFP Nepal accused of ‘perpetuating hunger’ in Karnali, pressured to ‘review report’ on ending freebies","date":"June 13, 2024","source":"np","link":"https://english.nepalpress.com/2024/06/13/wfp-nepal-accused-of-perpetuating-hunger-in-karnali-pressured-to-review-report-on-ending-freebies/","imageLink":"https://english.nepalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/UN-WFP-himbu.png","category":null,"content":"KATHMANDU: In what appears to be in line with widespread accusations that donor agencies want to continue hunger to profit from their philanthropic deeds, a recent book has unveiled that the World Food Program (WFP) is intentionally perpetuating hunger in Nepal’s Karnali region to profit from their philanthropic efforts.\nIn ‘Himbu’, an autobiography by Nepal’s renowned tourism entrepreneur Mr. Lhakpa Sonam Sherpa, the author sheds light on these claims from both an insider and outsider perspective.\nSherpa, who has airlifted WFP-supported food to Karnali for 18 years from his Tara Air, shares his firsthand experience with distributing free food in the region.

This interconnectedness is a powerful reminder that our choices, no matter how insignificant they may seem, ripple across the globe, affecting not just our lives but also the environment and those in distant lands.\nWhen a person in a distant country decides to drive a little more, thinking it won’t make a difference, that choice could indirectly contribute to the melting glaciers in the majestic mountains of Nepal. This illustrates how deeply interconnected our global system truly is. The boundaries that separate us—whether a country is classified as less developed, developing, or developed—blur in the face of the climate crisis.\nAs we reflect on these connections, we must confront a crucial question: who is responsible for these global changes, and who bears the brunt of their consequences? In this web of complex global connections, we are all part of the same story. Every action counts, and our collective story is shaped by our choices.\nSome countries, like Tuvalu—a small island developing state located halfway between Hawaii and Australia—exemplify the grave injustice inherent in this situation. The people of Tuvalu, with one of the smallest per-capita carbon footprints globally, grapple daily with the consequences of climate change, struggling to cultivate their staple foods as rising tides sweep away their land. Nepal, too, finds itself on the front lines, paying a heavy price for a crisis it did not cause.\nOne recent tragedy in Nepal underscores the country’s vulnerability. This year’s monsoon season brought extreme, erratic rainfall—some of the heaviest in over 50 years—triggering catastrophic floods and landslides that claimed dozens of lives. Within a few days, more than 200 people lost their lives, while many others were injured or displaced as homes, roads, and infrastructure were swept away. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, and rainfall patterns are growing increasingly unpredictable, both of which can be linked to climate change.\nSimilarly, the spread of malaria to Nepal’s mountainous regions is a troubling sign of climate change. Historically, malaria was virtually unknown in these colder areas, but rising temperatures have allowed mosquitoes to thrive. In a remote village in far-western Nepal, over 900 malaria cases have been reported in the last three years—a significant increase for an area that was once free of such diseases. A community health volunteer in the region shared that the health burden has worsened as warmer temperatures make it easier for mosquitoes to breed in these high-altitude areas.\nAnother such story is about the rain-shadow zone in Nepal, traditionally a dry region even during the monsoon season. However, rising temperatures are now causing more intense and frequent rains, resulting in landslides and floods that contaminate local water sources. What used to be a reliable supply of fresh meltwater is now often polluted, leading to frequent diarrhea and other health problems. As a result, waterborne diseases have become the second most significant health concern for the village’s residents.\nWhile people in such remote regions may not be familiar with terms like “climate change” or “global warming,” their experiences reflect its impact. Sadly, their stories often go unheard, both within their country and at international gatherings like COP.\nAs the COP 29 climate summit approaches this November in Azerbaijan, the question remains: will the voices of vulnerable nations like Nepal be heard? It seems as though the focus lies on setting an increased target for the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), but little attention is given to the strategic approach needed for managing these funds, given the inconsistencies observed in previous years.\nAccording to OECD data, 2022 marked a significant milestone: climate finance finally surpassed the US$100 billion target set in 2009, reaching US$115.9 billion. While this achievement came two years later than the original 2020 goal, it still represents a crucial step forward. However, it’s essential to examine how these funds have been allocated to support the most vulnerable populations.\nFrom 2015 to 2020, developed countries paid approximately $353 billion, with $189 billion coming from direct country-to-country payments. While these payments were intended as donations to support developing nations, 54% of the funding was provided as loans, leading to increased debt challenges for countries grappling with problems largely caused by the developed world.\nIn 2022, climate finance directed toward low-income countries remained relatively low, accounting for only 10%. The OECD report revealed that, similar to prior years, public climate finance was predominantly composed of loans, which represented 69% or $63.6 billion. Not all of these loans were concessional; some were provided at market rates. In comparison, grants constituted only 28% of the total, amounting to $25.6 billion, while equity investments were even less significant at $2.4 billion.\nThis approach of giving funds as loans at market rates is unusual for climate-related and other aid projects, which typically feature low or zero interest rates. Therefore, even if the pledge is fulfilled, we can conclude that it is exaggerated, as donor countries will redeem a significant portion of the climate finance through loan repayments and interest.\nSurprisingly, investments in retail stores, hotels, airports, and movie theaters have been classified as climate finance. For instance, Italy has invested in Asia to establish chocolate and gelato shops, while the United States provided loans to Haiti for developing coastal hotels. Meanwhile, Japan funded a new coal plant in Bangladesh and supported airport expansion in Egypt. These peculiar investments are being labeled as climate finance, despite the absence of official guidelines to regulate such activities. The responsible entity, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), seems more focused on tallying numbers than on making a genuine impact on climate change issues in the affected countries.\nThe goal of mobilizing $100 billion annually for climate action, as agreed upon in the Paris Agreement, can be seen through the lens of the butterfly effect. Investing in renewable energy, conservation, and adaptation strategies can lead to profound shifts in global carbon emissions, biodiversity, and community resilience.\nWhile climate finance is intended to support the poorest nations as compensation from developed countries, it has increasingly become a mechanism through which rich countries provide climate funding with interest attached. Climate finance has become a business venture, and money is being redirected back to the respective donor economies. As a result, vulnerable nations are stuck in a vicious cycle. With extreme weather conditions, they face economic losses that leave them with no other option but to take loans from developed countries. With heavy debt, they will have fewer resources to invest in climate solutions, further increasing the risk of climate stress. A report from the United Nations Development Program shows that fifty-four nations, including Egypt, Kenya, and Sri Lanka, which are heavily indebted by climate loans, are facing higher costs due to climate change.\nGiven such inconsistencies in fund allocation and effectiveness, there is a need to highlight the importance of a more thoughtful approach. As COP 29 approaches, it is imperative that discussions go beyond mere financial commitments and recognize the significance of equitable climate finance, ensuring that funds are allocated effectively to support those most affected. By prioritizing grants over loans and investing in genuine solutions rather than superficial projects, we can harness the power of collective action to create a positive ripple effect.\nJust as the flap of a butterfly’s wings can set off far-reaching changes, so too can the conscious choices of developed nations in climate finance help foster resilience, promote sustainability, and bridge the global inequities at the heart of the climate crisis. In the face of growing climate challenges, vulnerable countries like Nepal need genuine investment and immediate support—not empty promises or token gestures. As climate impacts intensify, the world’s most vulnerable countries must not be left to navigate this crisis alone.","summary":"KATHMANDU: The butterfly effect is the idea that even the smallest action—a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world—can set off a chain of events that leads to far-reaching consequences.

In the face of growing climate challenges, vulnerable countries like Nepal need genuine investment and immediate support—not empty promises or token gestures. As climate impacts intensify, the world’s most vulnerable countries must not be left to navigate this crisis alone."},{"hash":"88ce43344931571d24f702a1349ee8d31a0f99b9bba8cf0e4a636d612b14bd85","title":"Engineered Disasters – The amplified September 2024 catastrophe in the Nepal Himalaya","date":"October 30, 2024","source":"np","link":"https://english.nepalpress.com/2024/10/30/engineered-disasters-the-amplified-september-2024-catastrophe-in-the-nepal-himalaya/","imageLink":"https://english.nepalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/author.jpg","category":null,"content":"Phenomena like floods, landslides and earthquakes are the medium of hazard. But how we design and maintain infrastructure determines if hazards turn into disasters. Since today’s decisions affect the future, it is crucial that development be risk-sensitive. Disasters are not natural, they are the results of risk-insensitive development activities. For instance, in 2021/22 in a village in western Nepal, when technicians were planning to construct a bridge across the Mahadeva River, locals suggested a different alignment of the bridge to avoid the annual monsoon flood, which they face annually. However, the technicians disregarded communities’ suggestions and constructed what they thought was the best design. The next year, the flood entered the village. Likewise, in another Rural Municipality of the same region, locals suggested not constructing a hospital near a local river called Dolai, which is flood-prone, but again their suggestion was not considered. Now the hospital is vulnerable to inundation during seasonal monsoon rains. If a hazard is amplified to a disaster due to the ignorance of individuals (e.g. authorities, technicians and households) of local geography, risk histories, knowledge and community participation, we call it an “engineered disaster”.\nThe above are just representative examples of the ways in which development can create risk in Nepal. Every year, hundreds of such infrastructures are constructed without the knowledge and study of local risk geographies exposing them to hazards. The floods and landslides triggered by the 26-28 September 2024 rainfall, which took the lives of more than 240 people and loss of valuable infrastructure (e.g. roads, irrigation, energy, water, agriculture, etc.) incurring more than 15 billion Nepali rupees (initial estimation), were amplified due to the prevalence of infrastructure and houses on the banks of rivers. Given the huge loss Nepal experienced in the September 2024 catastrophe, we have the following five suggestions for future risk-sensitive development and urbanization. Implementing these is essential for Nepal to achieve a risk-resilient society as envisioned by the National Climate Change Policy 2019.\nFirst\nJust as countries located near the sea teach swimming to their citizens, given Nepal’s exposure to various hazards, providing education in geography and geology should be an integral part of the school-to-university education system, especially for those teaching technical subjects. Additionally, with its width ranging from lowland southern Tarai (<300 meters above sea level) to the Himalaya (8848 masl i.e. Mt. Everest) within around 200 kilometers, the geomorphology, climate and vegetation resemble areas ranging from equatorial to polar regions. So, the engineering methods used in the Tarai may not fit in the Hill and Himalayan regions. The models, methods and formulas used in other countries will need to be customized to fit local geography and geology. Without this, infrastructures turn into the very tools for amplifying hazard and disaster impacts, leading to the creation of more engineered disasters.\nSecond\nThe government has to regulate the haphazard expansion of settlements and the excavation of sand and rocks near river banks and upstream areas immediately. The widespread disaster caused by the September floods in the Kathmandu Valley was also due to the mining in river banks for construction materials. The growing construction in the surrounding hills (locally called kanth) and lowland areas (dol) of the Kathmandu Valley led rainfall water to flow directly into the main river, triggering overflowing and flooding. Additionally, the huge destruction that occurred in the Roshi River (Kavrepalanchwok district) and Nakhkhu River (Lalitpur district) was a great consequence of such haphazard excavation. Learning from the September 2024 disaster, therefore, the government has to focus on regulating haphazard construction and excavation as a national priority.\nThird\nThe haphazard road construction in the mid-hills region, an area of relatively soft geology, has led to increased landslide hazard. Without considering slope stability and monsoon water management during the construction, such roads can turn into creeks. Runoff can mix downstream rivers with debris including soil, sand, leaves and small rocks causing lateral erosion and landslides en route. Such disasters had already occurred in Nepal. Therefore, such haphazard road construction has to be highly regulated to encourage only the construction of high-quality and risk-resilient roads targeting local economic development.\nFourth\nImportantly, risk analysis is not routinely undertaken before infrastructure development. This should be an essential early step for risk reduction of potential hazards. For instance, if the risk analysis of the Melamchi Water Project (Sindhupalchwok district) had been done, we could have avoided the loss of huge destruction caused by landslides in June 2021. By studying the local geography, drainage system, past hazards, we could assess and avoid the potential impacts of construction on local geography and society thereby the sustainability and resilience of infrastructures. Hazards are a natural phenomenon, therefore if we, for example, can spend an additional 1 rupee for risk reduction at present we could avoid disaster equivalent to 10 rupees in the future. Alternatively, continuing infrastructure development without risk analysis means we are creating a favorable environment for future disasters.\nFifth\nNepal is highly vulnerable to landslides, floods, fires, earthquakes and climate change so the agencies related to risk management during and after disasters must be fully prepared. Unfortunately, the amplified catastrophe of September 2024 was also due to the government’s delayed rescue operation. For instance, in the September flood, four people standing on the roof of their house, which was corralled by the Nakkhu River flood, called for help for several hours but unluckily nobody reached there for help. The river swept their house, luckily two survived. Moreover, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology alerted the government regarding the September heavy rainfall and potential disasters more than a week before, the disaster management apertures of the government could not prepare and make necessary decisions in advance, consequently, people faced a huge loss. To avoid similar blunders in future, the risk reduction and management (e.g. rescue and relief) departments and line agencies must be in the ready-to-go form throughout the year.\nFinally, another rainfall akin to September 2024 could reoccur in Nepal. It may take a couple of decades, but there is a high chance of the reoccurrence. Therefore, to meet the goal of the National Climate Change Policy 2019, the three tiers of the government i.e. federal, provincial and local should consider, as suggested above, developing a risk-resilient society by considering local risk geography and promoting risk-sensitive infrastructure development in their constituencies from today.\nDr. Poudel is associated with Southasia Institute of Advanced Studies (SIAS), Nepal and Dr. Pelling is associated with University College London (UCL), United Kingdom","summary":"Phenomena like floods, landslides and earthquakes are the medium of hazard.

This year holds significant importance in Nepal’s diplomatic standing. On December 14, Nepal appointed Sewa Lamsal as the first woman secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Alongside this milestone, there are several other noteworthy diplomatic events in the oldest sovereign country in South Asia over the past 12 months. Here, we discuss Nepal’s 23 major diplomatic events of 2023:\n1. Pokhara International Airport operation: Nepal’s new year in 2023 began with the addition of a new international airport. The China-financed and constructed airport was formally inaugurated on 1 January. However, it did make the first international flight only on 21 June when a chartered flight from China carrying Ganesh Timalsina, chair of Nepal’s National Assembly and Chinese players for Nepal’s first Dragon Boat Festival. Chinese ambassador to Nepal Chen Song said the airport was part of BRI. After some criticism from the Nepali side that the airport concept was older than BRI’s birth, he didn’t repeat the same phrasing in his other publicly available statements and interviews. Pokhara International Airport has not been operational internationally. On 15 January, Yeti Airlines Flight 691 crashed nearby this airport killing all 72 people onboard.\n2.Four new diplomatic relations: Nepal established new diplomatic ties with four different countries in 2023: Republic of Malawi on February 16, Republic of Nauru on May 4, Republic of Cameroon on June 22, and Republic of Marshall Islands on June 23.\n3.Fake Bhutanese Refugee Scam: May witnessed the arrests of top political and bureaucratic figures in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. Former Deputy Prime Minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and Former Home Minister Balkrishna Khanda were among those arrested.\n4.India visit: Prime Minister Prachanda made a four-day visit to India from May 31 to June 3. His notable outcomes included India’s commitment to purchasing 10,000 megawatts of electricity in the upcoming decade and his counterpart Modi’s acknowledgment that Nepal and India have border problems. Controversially, Modi traveled to a village on Nepal’s border that is considered India-occupied on October 13.\n5.Nepal-Bangladesh power trade: On July 8, Nepal and Bangladesh formally agreed to enter into a long-term electricity export deal from Nepal, with an expected export volume of 40 megawatts. Talks are underway regarding a trilateral hydroelectricity investment involving Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.\n6. China visit: PM Prachanda made an 8-day official visit to China from September 22 to 29. His notable takeaways include the signing of a dozen agreements and memoranda of understanding. These agreements involve Nepal’s shift from the ‘One-China policy’ to the ‘One-China principle,’ as well as the reopening and addition of more bilateral border crossings.\n7. Hamas attacks: On October 7, during Hamas attacks on Israel, ten Nepali students were confirmed killed a day later. Nepal airlifted its citizens on October 11. A Nepali student named Bipin Joshi is still in Hamas captivity.\n8. Russian Ukraine war: On December 4, four Nepalis were officially confirmed killed while fighting alongside Russian forces. The confirmed figure has now reached seven. Four Nepalis are in Ukrainian capture. Nepal has lobbied both Russia and Ukraine to send back Nepalis, but to no avail.\n9. SAARC’s new Secretary General in Kathmandu: In the last week of October, SAARC’s new Secretary-General from Bangladesh, Golam Salwar, assumed his office in Kathmandu. Despite being dysfunctional since its last Kathmandu summit in 2014, SAARC has been paralyzed. However, it has not stopped breathing.\n10. UN Secretary-General arrival in Nepal: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made an official visit to Nepal from October 29 to November 1. He made Himalayan visit and talked about climate crisis in the Himalayas. He gave speech at Nepal’s joint sessions of houses and voiced for justice to conflict victims based on victim-centric international judicial practices.\n11. PM’s Temple diplomacy: Temple diplomacy was a new incarnation of PM Prachanda. From Mahakaleshwar of India (June 2) to Mt. Kailash of China’s Tibet Autonomous Region (September 28) and the visit to Nepal’s Pashupatinath Temple, among others, displayed his temple diplomacy to please Hindu quarters.\n12. North Korean exit: In the first week of November, North Korea formally closed its almost 50-year-old diplomatic mission in Kathmandu. It has assigned its existing New Delhi mission for Nepal’s affairs. With this, Kim Yong Su became the last residential North Korean ambassador to Nepal. He and his entire team left Nepal in the second week of November. He made a farewell call to PM Prachanda before his departure.\n13. Portugal outreach: On November 9, Nepal’s cabinet decided to open a new embassy in Lisbon, Portugal’s capital. At least 20,000 Nepalis are said to have resided in Portugal. Sanil Nepal was picked as the first ambassador from Nepal this month.\n14. Defeat in WHO regional elections: In what appeared to signal Nepal’s diplomatic failure, Nepal witnessed a humiliating defeat for the WHO Regional Director position with the Bangladeshi candidate on November 1. Out of 10 votes, Nepal’s candidate Dr. Shambhu Acharya secured just two votes against the Bangladeshi candidate Sheikh Hasina Wazed.\n15. COP-28: PM Prachanda left for the COP-28 venue in the UAE on November 28. He returned to Nepal on December 3. He gave his speech on December 3. He was also part of the 52nd National Unity Day and ‘Sayed Sustainability Award’ in the UAE. He had bilateral meetings with the UN Secretary-General and some other world leaders, including Indian PM Modi. The issue of Himalayan glacial melt was one of the notable issues at COP-28.\n16. Italy visit: PM Prachanda visited Italy from July 22 to 28. While in Rome, he participated in the WFO-organized ‘Food System Summit +2.’ During his speech, PM Dahal represented Least Developed Countries (LDC) and emphasized increased agricultural investment. Throughout his stay in Rome, he also conducted bilateral meetings with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, among others.\n17. Qatar: Qatar came into the spotlight of Nepal’s diplomacy for three reasons. First, PM Prachanda’s scheduled and canceled visit on February 27. He was supposed to attend a program of the Fifth Conference of the Least Developed Countries and was set to leave the country on March 3. He canceled his visit on February 27 for ‘important political engagements’ in Nepal. If he had visited Qatar, it would have been his first foreign visit. Second reason of Qatari issues was a possible visit by a high level from the gas-rich Arab country. Third reason was Qatar’s potential to meditate for the release of Nepali student Bipin Joshi from Hamas activity.\n18. Australian Minister visit: Australia’s Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts visited Kathmandu from May 16 to 17. He paid a visit to the Hindu shrine of Pashupatinath. As Australia becomes one of the most favored destinations for Nepali students, more top-level visits between the two countries are expected.\n19. MCC: The American project of MCC was ratified by Nepal’s parliament last year. However, the $500 million project is still in limbo when it comes to visible outcomes. Despite no tangible MCC outcomes for transmission lines and roadways, there were high-level visits from the US, including the February 7 visit of the Administrator of the USAID Samantha Power and the July 13 visit of US Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, among others.\n20. BRF: So far, there are no tangible infrastructural outcomes of Nepal’s participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since the first Belt and Road Forum (BRF) in 2017. However, Nepal was not absent in the Third Belt and Road Forum which was held in Beijing from October 17 to 18. Nepal’s delegation was led by Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha.\n21. Electricity trade with China: While claiming the one-year ‘success’ of his government, PM Prachanda highlighted the first ongoing trans-Himalayan transmission lines between Nepal and China. He stated that works are underway to erect the Chilime-Kerung 220 kV transmission lines. When this comes into operation, it would be an added option for Nepal’s incumbent India-dependent energy trade.\n22. Asian Games and Asia Cup Goodwill: From a sporting perspective, Nepal’s two medals at the Hangzhou Asian Games, praiseworthy cricketing performance against heavyweight cricketing nations at the Asia Cup from August 30 to September 17, and participation in the Asian Games from September 23 to October 8 were noted as part of Nepal’s sporting goodwill.\n23. Nepal’s absence in Raisina Dialogue and G-20 Summit: Two notable physical events in Nepal’s southern neighbor were the Raisina Dialogue, held from March 2 to 4 and supported by the Indian Government, which invited many world leaders but not Nepali representatives. Likewise, in the G-20 summit from September 9 to 10, Nepal was absent among the invitees.","summary":"KATHMANDU:  Today is the penultimate day of 2023.

Former Deputy Prime Minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and Former Home Minister Balkrishna Khanda were among those arrested.\n4.India visit: Prime Minister Prachanda made a four-day visit to India from May 31 to June 3. His notable outcomes included India’s commitment to purchasing 10,000 megawatts of electricity in the upcoming decade and his counterpart Modi’s acknowledgment that Nepal and India have border problems. Controversially, Modi traveled to a village on Nepal’s border that is considered India-occupied on October 13.\n5.Nepal-Bangladesh power trade: On July 8, Nepal and Bangladesh formally agreed to enter into a long-term electricity export deal from Nepal, with an expected export volume of 40 megawatts. Talks are underway regarding a trilateral hydroelectricity investment involving Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.\n6. China visit: PM Prachanda made an 8-day official visit to China from September 22 to 29. His notable takeaways include the signing of a dozen agreements and memoranda of understanding. These agreements involve Nepal’s shift from the ‘One-China policy’ to the ‘One-China principle,’ as well as the reopening and addition of more bilateral border crossings.\n7. Hamas attacks: On October 7, during Hamas attacks on Israel, ten Nepali students were confirmed killed a day later. Nepal airlifted its citizens on October 11. A Nepali student named Bipin Joshi is still in Hamas captivity.\n8. Russian Ukraine war: On December 4, four Nepalis were officially confirmed killed while fighting alongside Russian forces. The confirmed figure has now reached seven. Four Nepalis are in Ukrainian capture. Nepal has lobbied both Russia and Ukraine to send back Nepalis, but to no avail.\n9. SAARC’s new Secretary General in Kathmandu: In the last week of October, SAARC’s new Secretary-General from Bangladesh, Golam Salwar, assumed his office in Kathmandu. Despite being dysfunctional since its last Kathmandu summit in 2014, SAARC has been paralyzed. However, it has not stopped breathing.\n10. UN Secretary-General arrival in Nepal: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made an official visit to Nepal from October 29 to November 1. He made Himalayan visit and talked about climate crisis in the Himalayas. He gave speech at Nepal’s joint sessions of houses and voiced for justice to conflict victims based on victim-centric international judicial practices.\n11. PM’s Temple diplomacy: Temple diplomacy was a new incarnation of PM Prachanda. From Mahakaleshwar of India (June 2) to Mt. Kailash of China’s Tibet Autonomous Region (September 28) and the visit to Nepal’s Pashupatinath Temple, among others, displayed his temple diplomacy to please Hindu quarters.\n12. North Korean exit: In the first week of November, North Korea formally closed its almost 50-year-old diplomatic mission in Kathmandu. It has assigned its existing New Delhi mission for Nepal’s affairs. With this, Kim Yong Su became the last residential North Korean ambassador to Nepal. He and his entire team left Nepal in the second week of November. He made a farewell call to PM Prachanda before his departure.\n13. Portugal outreach: On November 9, Nepal’s cabinet decided to open a new embassy in Lisbon, Portugal’s capital. At least 20,000 Nepalis are said to have resided in Portugal. Sanil Nepal was picked as the first ambassador from Nepal this month.\n14. Defeat in WHO regional elections: In what appeared to signal Nepal’s diplomatic failure, Nepal witnessed a humiliating defeat for the WHO Regional Director position with the Bangladeshi candidate on November 1. Out of 10 votes, Nepal’s candidate Dr. Shambhu Acharya secured just two votes against the Bangladeshi candidate Sheikh Hasina Wazed.\n15. COP-28: PM Prachanda left for the COP-28 venue in the UAE on November 28. He returned to Nepal on December 3. He gave his speech on December 3. He was also part of the 52nd National Unity Day and ‘Sayed Sustainability Award’ in the UAE. He had bilateral meetings with the UN Secretary-General and some other world leaders, including Indian PM Modi. The issue of Himalayan glacial melt was one of the notable issues at COP-28.\n16. Italy visit: PM Prachanda visited Italy from July 22 to 28. While in Rome, he participated in the WFO-organized ‘Food System Summit +2.’ During his speech, PM Dahal represented Least Developed Countries (LDC) and emphasized increased agricultural investment. Throughout his stay in Rome, he also conducted bilateral meetings with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, among others.\n17. Qatar: Qatar came into the spotlight of Nepal’s diplomacy for three reasons. First, PM Prachanda’s scheduled and canceled visit on February 27. He was supposed to attend a program of the Fifth Conference of the Least Developed Countries and was set to leave the country on March 3. He canceled his visit on February 27 for ‘important political engagements’ in Nepal. If he had visited Qatar, it would have been his first foreign visit. Second reason of Qatari issues was a possible visit by a high level from the gas-rich Arab country. Third reason was Qatar’s potential to meditate for the release of Nepali student Bipin Joshi from Hamas activity.\n18. Australian Minister visit: Australia’s Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts visited Kathmandu from May 16 to 17. He paid a visit to the Hindu shrine of Pashupatinath. As Australia becomes one of the most favored destinations for Nepali students, more top-level visits between the two countries are expected.\n19. MCC: The American project of MCC was ratified by Nepal’s parliament last year. However, the $500 million project is still in limbo when it comes to visible outcomes. Despite no tangible MCC outcomes for transmission lines and roadways, there were high-level visits from the US, including the February 7 visit of the Administrator of the USAID Samantha Power and the July 13 visit of US Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, among others.\n20. BRF: So far, there are no tangible infrastructural outcomes of Nepal’s participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since the first Belt and Road Forum (BRF) in 2017. However, Nepal was not absent in the Third Belt and Road Forum which was held in Beijing from October 17 to 18. Nepal’s delegation was led by Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha.\n21. Electricity trade with China: While claiming the one-year ‘success’ of his government, PM Prachanda highlighted the first ongoing trans-Himalayan transmission lines between Nepal and China. He stated that works are underway to erect the Chilime-Kerung 220 kV transmission lines. When this comes into operation, it would be an added option for Nepal’s incumbent India-dependent energy trade.\n22. Asian Games and Asia Cup Goodwill: From a sporting perspective, Nepal’s two medals at the Hangzhou Asian Games, praiseworthy cricketing performance against heavyweight cricketing nations at the Asia Cup from August 30 to September 17, and participation in the Asian Games from September 23 to October 8 were noted as part of Nepal’s sporting goodwill.\n23. Nepal’s absence in Raisina Dialogue and G-20 Summit: Two notable physical events in Nepal’s southern neighbor were the Raisina Dialogue, held from March 2 to 4 and supported by the Indian Government, which invited many world leaders but not Nepali representatives. Likewise, in the G-20 summit from September 9 to 10, Nepal was absent among the invitees."},{"hash":"f1ff7d5e30c5d588df0e7e8899f67774f6c8c96051e091cf9ae11fbfc71b0c08","title":"Israel resumes Gaza assault after rockets fired, heavy fighting reported","date":"December 1, 2023","source":"np","link":"https://english.nepalpress.com/2023/12/01/israel-resumes-gaza-assault-after-rockets-fired-heavy-fighting-reported/","imageLink":"https://english.nepalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NYOZQS423FM2XFARY4GXMOVA4Y.jpg","category":null,"content":"Israel resumed combat operations against Hamas in Gaza on Friday after accusing the Palestinian militant group of firing rockets at Israel and reneging on a deal to free all women held as hostages, violating their temporary truce agreement, Reuters reported.\nThe seven-day pause, which began on Nov. 24 and was extended twice, had allowed for the exchange of dozens of hostages held in Gaza for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and facilitated the entry of humanitarian aid into the shattered coastal strip.\nIn the hour before the truce was set to end at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT), Israel said it intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza.\nThere was no immediate comment from Hamas or claim of responsibility for the launch.\n“With the resumption of fighting we emphasise: The Israeli government is committed to achieving the goals of the war – to free our hostages, to eliminate Hamas, and to ensure that Gaza will never pose a threat to the residents of Israel,” the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.\nHamas was also defiant.\n“What Israel did not achieve during the fifty days before the truce, it will not achieve by continuing its aggression after the truce,” Ezzat El Rashq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said on the group’s web site.\nPalestinian media and Gaza’s interior ministry reported Israeli air and artillery strikes across the enclave after the truce expired, including in Rafah, near the border with Egypt.\nIn Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, a Reuters witness said he could hear heavy shelling and see smoke rising in the east of the town.

During the first day of the exhibition, Huawei hosted the Industrial Digital and Intelligent Transformation Summit and launched joint solutions with partners for ten industries like public utilities, transportation, finance, electric power, oil & gas, mining, retail, education, and healthcare, and a series of new flagship products. These solutions and products are designed to support customers in enhancing their digital and intelligent transformation.\nHuawei is Innovating Nonstop to Help Customers Succeed, Enable Local Partners, and Cultivate Local Talent\nLi Peng, Corporate Senior Vice President, President of ICT Sales & Service, Huawei, delivered opening remarks at the summit. “We’re combining our strengths in networking, storage, computing, cloud, and energy,” said Li, “and we’re working with partners to build new digital and intelligent infrastructure.”\nLast year, Huawei released a reference architecture for the intelligent transformation of industries. In his speech, Li detailed how Huawei has since put this architecture into practice to provide customers with leading and adaptable solutions for industries like government, finance, electric power, transportation, manufacturing, oil and gas, mining, and Internet. “We have summarized over 100 case studies that different industry customers can use to accelerate their digital and intelligent transformation”, said Li.\nThese achievements would be impossible without our partners”, Li continued. “At Huawei, we’re committed to building a healthy, open, and mutually beneficial partner ecosystem. We have also established 14 OpenLabs worldwide to support joint innovation with local solution partners. Together with over 30 solution partners in the UAE, we have developed more than 20 solutions to meet local industry needs.”\nLi went on to describe how Huawei is innovating nonstop to provide partners with lightweight solutions, marketable products, end-to-end business enablement services, and efficient digital platforms to help them serve SMEs more independently, easily, and effectively.\nHe concluded by describing Huawei’s efforts to help develop local digital talent and develop the industry ecosystem, which is key to promoting sustainable development. “Moving forward, Huawei is ready and willing to join forces with more customers and partners to enable industrial digital and intelligent transformation and bring more benefits to the lives and work of people around the world,” Li added.\nAccelerating Industrial Digitalization and Intelligence for a Leap in Productivity\nAmid the wave of digital and intelligent transformation, Huawei urges all parties to collaborate and seize new opportunities.\nDuring his keynote speech, Leo Chen, Corporate Senior Vice President and President of Enterprise Sales, Huawei, emphasized that AI and 5G-A are among the next-gen technologies driving the fourth industrial revolution, which will lead to a significant leap in productivity. However, this transformation also brings challenges in infrastructure, industrial applications, and talent ecosystems. Huawei is committed to utilizing its unique advantages to help customers and partners succeed in the intelligent era.\nIn the future, Huawei will continue to leverage its full-stack capabilities in connectivity, storage, computing, and cloud to assist industries in building AI-ready ICT infrastructure.\nHuawei will also accelerate the application of advanced technologies in various industry scenarios to resolve business pain points. To this end, Huawei has published the Amplifying Industrial Digitalization & Intelligence Practice White Paper, which includes more than 100 success stories from over 20 industries for customers to reference during their own transformation.\nIn addition, Huawei plans to strengthen its Huawei-Partner cooperation system and cultivate a digital and intelligent talent ecosystem. Huawei has developed a new Global Digital Index (GDI) alongside with IDC to offer customers worldwide quantitative evaluation indicators for transformation. These initiatives demonstrate Huawei’s dedication to bringing intelligence to all industries.\nBuilding Next-Gen ICT Infrastructure to Strengthen the Foundation of Digital and Intelligent Transformation\nIn his keynote speech, David Shi, Vice President of ICT Marketing and Solution Sales, Huawei, emphasized the importance of building a solid ICT infrastructure for enterprises to succeed in the intelligent era. He highlighted two key points to expedite this transformation: accelerating the popularization of ICT infrastructure and accelerating monetization. “Only by working closely with our customers and partners can we truly bring intelligence to all industries. Huawei is willing to work with all of you to build digital and intelligent infrastructure, win in the new era, and create a better future,” said Shi.\nAccelerating the popularization of ICT infrastructure enables more partners and customers to seamlessly integrate, access, and use ICT infrastructure, allowing it to evolve alongside business needs. Huawei has proposed four principles to simplify the process of building and using ICT infrastructure: easy to integrate, access, use, and evolve. These facilitate the widespread use of ICT infrastructure in usual scenarios like campuses, WANs, and data centers, making it more accessible for various industries and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.\nAccelerating monetization refers to speeding up service innovation and value creation through digital and intelligent technologies, integrating technologies and scenarios, and collaborating to build a thriving partner ecosystem that supports continuous enterprise growth.\nHuawei is committed to innovation and developing a range of industry-specific solutions to meet customers’ requirements in different scenarios. These solutions are designed to assist customers in achieving their transformation step by step. During the summit, Huawei worked with partners to unveil digital and intelligent transformation solutions for ten industries, including National Government Cloud Solution, ICT Talent Cultivation Solution, Medical Technology Digitalization Solution 2.0, Digital CORE Solution, Smart Retail Solution, One-Cloud, One-Network, Multi-Hub Solution, Transportation Operations Coordination Center-Advanced (TOCC-A) Solution, Intelligent Distribution Solution, Unstaffed Open-Pit Mine Solution, and Intelligent Oil & Gas Field Solution. These solutions aim to help customers achieve greater success in the intelligent era.\nIn addition, Huawei is striving to streamline the popularization of ICT infrastructure and promote its adoption. With a focus on typical scenarios like campuses, WANs, and data centers, Huawei has released flagship products and portfolios and developed user-friendly HUAWEI eKit products.

During the first day of the exhibition, Huawei hosted the Industrial Digital and Intelligent Transformation Summit and launched joint solutions with partners for ten industries like public utilities, transportation, finance, electric power, oil & gas, mining, retail, education, and healthcare, and a series of new flagship products. These solutions and products are designed to support customers in enhancing their digital and intelligent transformation.\nHuawei is Innovating Nonstop to Help Customers Succeed, Enable Local Partners, and Cultivate Local Talent\nLi Peng, Corporate Senior Vice President, President of ICT Sales & Service, Huawei, delivered opening remarks at the summit. “We’re combining our strengths in networking, storage, computing, cloud, and energy,” said Li, “and we’re working with partners to build new digital and intelligent infrastructure.”\nLast year, Huawei released a reference architecture for the intelligent transformation of industries. In his speech, Li detailed how Huawei has since put this architecture into practice to provide customers with leading and adaptable solutions for industries like government, finance, electric power, transportation, manufacturing, oil and gas, mining, and Internet. “We have summarized over 100 case studies that different industry customers can use to accelerate their digital and intelligent transformation”, said Li.\nThese achievements would be impossible without our partners”, Li continued. “At Huawei, we’re committed to building a healthy, open, and mutually beneficial partner ecosystem. We have also established 14 OpenLabs worldwide to support joint innovation with local solution partners. Together with over 30 solution partners in the UAE, we have developed more than 20 solutions to meet local industry needs.”\nLi went on to describe how Huawei is innovating nonstop to provide partners with lightweight solutions, marketable products, end-to-end business enablement services, and efficient digital platforms to help them serve SMEs more independently, easily, and effectively.\nHe concluded by describing Huawei’s efforts to help develop local digital talent and develop the industry ecosystem, which is key to promoting sustainable development. “Moving forward, Huawei is ready and willing to join forces with more customers and partners to enable industrial digital and intelligent transformation and bring more benefits to the lives and work of people around the world,” Li added.\nAccelerating Industrial Digitalization and Intelligence for a Leap in Productivity\nAmid the wave of digital and intelligent transformation, Huawei urges all parties to collaborate and seize new opportunities.\nDuring his keynote speech, Leo Chen, Corporate Senior Vice President and President of Enterprise Sales, Huawei, emphasized that AI and 5G-A are among the next-gen technologies driving the fourth industrial revolution, which will lead to a significant leap in productivity. However, this transformation also brings challenges in infrastructure, industrial applications, and talent ecosystems. Huawei is committed to utilizing its unique advantages to help customers and partners succeed in the intelligent era.\nIn the future, Huawei will continue to leverage its full-stack capabilities in connectivity, storage, computing, and cloud to assist industries in building AI-ready ICT infrastructure.\nHuawei will also accelerate the application of advanced technologies in various industry scenarios to resolve business pain points. To this end, Huawei has published the Amplifying Industrial Digitalization & Intelligence Practice White Paper, which includes more than 100 success stories from over 20 industries for customers to reference during their own transformation.\nIn addition, Huawei plans to strengthen its Huawei-Partner cooperation system and cultivate a digital and intelligent talent ecosystem. Huawei has developed a new Global Digital Index (GDI) alongside with IDC to offer customers worldwide quantitative evaluation indicators for transformation. These initiatives demonstrate Huawei’s dedication to bringing intelligence to all industries.\nBuilding Next-Gen ICT Infrastructure to Strengthen the Foundation of Digital and Intelligent Transformation\nIn his keynote speech, David Shi, Vice President of ICT Marketing and Solution Sales, Huawei, emphasized the importance of building a solid ICT infrastructure for enterprises to succeed in the intelligent era. He highlighted two key points to expedite this transformation: accelerating the popularization of ICT infrastructure and accelerating monetization. “Only by working closely with our customers and partners can we truly bring intelligence to all industries. Huawei is willing to work with all of you to build digital and intelligent infrastructure, win in the new era, and create a better future,” said Shi.\nAccelerating the popularization of ICT infrastructure enables more partners and customers to seamlessly integrate, access, and use ICT infrastructure, allowing it to evolve alongside business needs. Huawei has proposed four principles to simplify the process of building and using ICT infrastructure: easy to integrate, access, use, and evolve. These facilitate the widespread use of ICT infrastructure in usual scenarios like campuses, WANs, and data centers, making it more accessible for various industries and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.\nAccelerating monetization refers to speeding up service innovation and value creation through digital and intelligent technologies, integrating technologies and scenarios, and collaborating to build a thriving partner ecosystem that supports continuous enterprise growth.\nHuawei is committed to innovation and developing a range of industry-specific solutions to meet customers’ requirements in different scenarios. These solutions are designed to assist customers in achieving their transformation step by step. During the summit, Huawei worked with partners to unveil digital and intelligent transformation solutions for ten industries, including National Government Cloud Solution, ICT Talent Cultivation Solution, Medical Technology Digitalization Solution 2.0, Digital CORE Solution, Smart Retail Solution, One-Cloud, One-Network, Multi-Hub Solution, Transportation Operations Coordination Center-Advanced (TOCC-A) Solution, Intelligent Distribution Solution, Unstaffed Open-Pit Mine Solution, and Intelligent Oil & Gas Field Solution. These solutions aim to help customers achieve greater success in the intelligent era.\nIn addition, Huawei is striving to streamline the popularization of ICT infrastructure and promote its adoption. With a focus on typical scenarios like campuses, WANs, and data centers, Huawei has released flagship products and portfolios and developed user-friendly HUAWEI eKit products. These act as a powerful tool for enterprises’ digital transformation by enabling more efficient integration and usage for customers and partners.\nDavid Shi, Vice President of ICT Marketing and Solution Sales, Huawei\nGrow Together, Win in the Intelligent Era\nHuawei’s “SHAPE” framework supports partners in five key areas: sustaining the leadership, honing joint innovation with partners, advancing partner capability development, promoting partner cooperation experience, and expanding partner growth opportunities.

When viewed superficially, it looks like a horror movie. But when we deeply delve into the plot and conversations, which happened at a very slow pace between the characters, we come to the conclusion that the red suitcase puller [Praveen Khatiwada] was, in fact, a hallucination of a pick-up van driver [Saugat Malla].\nOnly after the movie concludes do we realize that the seed of hallucination began to sprout in Malla’s mind soon after he loaded a coffin with the dead body of a Nepali migrant worker and the red suitcase of the deceased man into his van.\nIn a short scene, we can see a man in a blue jumpsuit with a red suitcase in his hand standing in a bus station. The video is shot in such a way that the viewer can assume he might have taken a vehicle passing by. By the middle of the movie, it becomes clear that he had climbed onto the van driven by Malla. That was Malla’s first hallucination.\nAs he was driving the van on the highway, he listened to a phone-in program on the radio, where he heard a man telling how he saw a mysterious man in a bus station, who vanished all of a sudden. That conversation in the phone-in program was another hallucination of Malla.\nSome people peeped inside his van, suggesting that someone else was there. But Malla didn’t bother to give a look. It is because that too was his hallucination.\nAs the night fell, he went to the hotel which lies by the side of the highway. That hotel happens to be owned by a retired army personnel [Bipin Karki] serving in the Indian army, who offered him liquor and food. The hotel and the host both were Malla’s hallucination. It becomes clearer when we analyze the conversation between Malla and Karki in the light of the happenings by the end of the movie.\nDuring the conversation, Malla said that after seeing the dead body of his teacher Mukti Nath Adhikari, who was murdered in a ruthless way by the Maoist guerrillas, he was deeply traumatized, and it changed the course of his life. He feels very sorry for those Nepali workers who died abroad. He has deep sympathy for the dead bodies. We can infer that such sympathy was a result of his trauma, which had left a deeper scar in his mind after seeing the dead body of his teacher.\nDuring the conversation, he says that he wishes no migrant workers die abroad. It means that he wants to correct their course by making them alive, at least in his imagination. That day too, he must have wanted the dead body inside the coffin to visit his house being alive, along with his red suitcase. Exactly the same scene is shown in the movie. It was another hallucination of Malla.\nDespite Karki’s plea for him to spend the night in his house, Malla insists on sleeping inside the van. By the end of the movie, it becomes clear that the house was abandoned and in a wrecked state. It was in no condition to accommodate him. We can assume that that’s why he slept in the van. Malla said to Karki that spending nights in the van had become his routine as he has to deliver about 20-25 dead bodies of the migrant workers to their relatives every month, and for this, he has to travel the highways almost on a daily basis. It does indicate that he had been hallucinating in a similar way in the past also. That night was just another hallucinating night for him.\nAs a driver with deep sympathy for the dead people who very frequently rides across the highways, it is highly likely that he must be aware of the retired army personnel who had committed suicide. He might have wished him to remain alive. That’s why he made him alive and had a conversation with him in a hallucinating state.\nAs the van reached its destination, Malla opened the coffin. Inside the coffin, there was a dead body wrapped in a blue jumpsuit. As Malla has been delivering dead bodies for a long time, he was aware that the bodies are wrapped in the blue jumpsuit. That’s why he hallucinated the dead body in the blue jumpsuit approaching his home by rolling his red suitcase to meet his dear ones.\nAfter he returns by delivering the dead body, a couple of scenes suggest that he believes in the ghosts. Firstly, he gets off from the van, plucks a branch of a thorny bush, and lays it on the road, suggesting that he believes it blocks the spirit of the dead body from approaching him. After a while, he goes to a river, washes the van, and lights a sacred flame to completely do away with the spirit. Only a person who believes in ghosts is more likely to hallucinate in that way.\nAll these events suggest that The Red Suitcase is a psychological thriller. When you watch the movie and come out of the theater, you will be carrying its deep effect in your mind, which will take at least some weeks to fade.","summary":"KATHMANDU: The Red Suitcase, a movie directed by Fidel Devkota, belongs to the psychological thriller genre.
