Earlier this week, Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal wrote to the Prime Minister's Office where she stated that a decision had already been taken at the ministerial level to sign the implementation plan of the Belt and Road Initiative, urging the ministry to sign the agreement during Sunâs visit. But the press statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday after the conclusion of the foreign secretary-level meeting does not mention any discussions on the signing of the BRI implementation plan or any other BRI-related topics.The signing and discussion of the plan were on the agenda of both sides during the meeting. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, speaking in Parliament, said discussions were underway to finalise the BRI implementation plan. We are in the final stages of moving forward with it, and an agreement will soon be reached, he said.The prime minister while responding to lawmakersâ queries on Tuesday said that the implementation plan will be signed either in one or two days or at a later date. Top government sources had told the Post that if the plan could not be signed during Sun Weidongâs stay in Kathmandu, it is likely to be signed during the Kathmandu visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is also the state councillor of China, later this year. Entitled âImplementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Peopleâs Republic of China and the Government of Nepalâ, the BRI implementation plan sets over two dozen cooperation priorities.Sun will wrap up his three-day trip on Wednesday and return to China the same day. Although the date of Wangâs visit to Nepal is yet to be fixed, he is expected to travel to Kathmandu in August or September.Prime Minister Dahal also revealed several conditions that Nepal has included in the BRI implementation plan while addressing lawmakersâ queries in Parliament on Tuesday.Earlier this week, Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal wrote to the Prime Minister's Office stating that a ministerial-level decision had already been taken to sign the Plan. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha took the decision, which was then sent to the PMO for approval, according to the correspondence seen by the Post.âThe Nepal government and the Peopleâs Republic of China signed the memorandum of understanding [MoU] on cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative on May 12, 2017. In order to implement that plan, the BRI implementation plan needs to be signed,â said the correspondence made by Secretary Lamsal.In early 2020, the Chinese side sent the first draft of the plan detailing the execution of projects under the BRI, including their funding modalities like loan, grant, and interest rates. The foreign secretaryâs letter explains why Nepal needs to sign the implementation plan.Lamsal stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received positive feedback and consensus from the ministries of Finance and Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs and seeks the authority to sign the plan.Multiple officials involved in the negotiation process told the Post that the agreement was shelved at the last minute due to technical reasons and reservations over the draft.One reason is that the prime minister could not take the ruling parties into confidence and in fact he did not even consult many of them, said a minister who is aware of the BRI implementation plan related developments. Another reason was that the Chinese side delayed responding to some minor corrections that Nepal had proposed in the draft. âBeijing simply failed to respond on time. More than this, there could also be geopolitical reasons behind the delay in the planâs signing,â said the minister.Earlier, after the Nepali side was reluctant to discuss and carry forward the implementation plan due to the Covid pandemic and related restrictions, the Chinese side again sent the next draft in October 2021 to the foreign ministry during the premiership of Sher Bahadur Deuba.After consulting various line ministries, the Deuba government informed the visiting Chinese foreign minister and state councillor Wang Yi in March 2022 that Nepal prefers grants over loans to fund BRI projects. The government also informed that the interest rate should not exceed one percent, there must be a competitive bidding process, and repayment terms for the concessional loan should be similar to those of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other multilateral and bilateral lenders.Our priority is grant, not loan, said Prime Minister Dahal on Tuesday, while echoing the position of the Deuba government.âOur first priority is grants, not loans. If we do need to take loans, we will not pay an interest rate higher than what we are paying to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank,â said Prime Minister Dahal in Parliament on Tuesday, stating Nepal cannot afford beyond 1.5 percent annual interest rate proposed for BRI projects.Nepali Congress lawmakers Prakash Sharan Mahat, Ram Hari Khatiwada, Badri Pandey, and Sishir Khanal of Rastriya Swatantra Party, among others, had asked the government about its efforts to implement the BRI and its implementation plan.âWe are already burdened by debt, so before taking more loans, we have to think twice,â said Mahat. The prime minister also stated that Nepal is mindful of the debt trap. âWe will push the agreement by ensuring that we wonât fall into a debt trap,â the prime minister said. Khatiwada questioned, âWhy isnât the government insisting on grants under the BRI?â The prime minister later clarified any loans taken will not exceed the interest rates paid to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.Multiple officials at the Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that matters related to loans, grants, concessional loans, and other repayment structures have yet to be settled by the two sides. There is a lack of harmonisation between the two sides, although the Nepali side has repeatedly insisted on grant and soft loan from China for various projects under the BRI. The text of the BRI implementation plan outlines several areas of cooperation between Nepal and China. âWe have to go for grants. We need donations, and I have also told the Chinese side that we cannot afford an interest rate beyond 1 or 1.5 percent per annum,â said the prime minister in Parliament. Nepal currently pays a two percent yearly interest rate to Chinaâs EXIM Bank, which funded the construction of the Pokhara International Airport.Khanal of Rastriya Swatantra Party demanded formal discussion and deliberation of the BRI in Parliament.Due to a lack of discussion in Parliament, there is unnecessary and negative discourse outside the House, said Khanal. âWe signed the BRI framework agreement with China in 2017. As we never had proper discussion in the House, there was unnecessary discussion and debate outside. That might invite problems in our relations with China,â he said. The BRI implementation plan got more traction during the China visit of Prime Minister Dahal last year. A joint statement issued after the visit stated that both sides would conclude the negotiations on the BRI implementation plan and prepare for its signing. The National Planning Commission then expedited consultations with various line ministries, particularly with finance and law ministries. âAfter both ministries forwarded their inputs, a new draft emerged,â a minister who is aware of the latest development said. But there are some reservations from the Chinese side regarding the financing and investment modalities, as the prime minister said during Tuesdayâs meeting of the House of Representatives.âNow the signing has been postponed until further notice. But both sides have assured that the plan would be signed during a high-level visit in the near future,â the minister added. Consultation mechanism meeting concludes The 16th meeting of Nepal-China Diplomatic Consultation Mechanism concluded Tuesday. During the meeting, the two sides reviewed the whole gamut of bilateral relations and assessed progress made in the implementation of agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) signed and the decisions made in the past, said the foreign ministry statement. âThey expressed firm commitment to further promote cooperation in mutually agreed areas and committed to work in realisation of economic opportunities for mutual benefits. Both the heads of delegation reiterated that strong foundations of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Panchsheel, mutual trust, goodwill, and understanding remain the guiding features of Nepal-China bilateral relations,â the statement said. Foreign Secretary Lamsal thanked her counterpart for the commitment of the Chinese side to enhancing development cooperation amidst Nepal's LDC graduation in 2026. Likewise, Vice Minister Sun appreciated Nepal's commitment to One China Principle. Both sides shared views on maintaining the tradition of regular exchange of high-level visits, said the statement, and they discussed ways and means to further enhance cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, infrastructure development, connectivity, agriculture, among others. This includes the promotion of Nepalâs tourism prospects in China in the context of celebration of the year 2025 as âVisit Nepal Year in China, according to the foreign ministry. Both sides decided to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between Nepal and China with special programmes and activities in 2025.The two sides stressed the need to further activate the existing bilateral mechanisms and establish new ones, including a joint commission at the level of foreign ministers. The Nepali delegation comprised Joint Secretary and Head of North East Asia Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Krishna Prasad Dhakal and senior officials from relevant ministries and government agencies. Likewise, the Chinese delegation had Ambassador of China to Nepal Chen Song and other senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu.

In order to implement that plan, the BRI implementation plan needs to be signed,â said the correspondence made by Secretary Lamsal.In early 2020, the Chinese side sent the first draft of the plan detailing the execution of projects under the BRI, including their funding modalities like loan, grant, and interest rates. The foreign secretaryâs letter explains why Nepal needs to sign the implementation plan.Lamsal stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received positive feedback and consensus from the ministries of Finance and Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs and seeks the authority to sign the plan.Multiple officials involved in the negotiation process told the Post that the agreement was shelved at the last minute due to technical reasons and reservations over the draft.One reason is that the prime minister could not take the ruling parties into confidence and in fact he did not even consult many of them, said a minister who is aware of the BRI implementation plan related developments. Another reason was that the Chinese side delayed responding to some minor corrections that Nepal had proposed in the draft. âBeijing simply failed to respond on time. More than this, there could also be geopolitical reasons behind the delay in the planâs signing,â said the minister.Earlier, after the Nepali side was reluctant to discuss and carry forward the implementation plan due to the Covid pandemic and related restrictions, the Chinese side again sent the next draft in October 2021 to the foreign ministry during the premiership of Sher Bahadur Deuba.After consulting various line ministries, the Deuba government informed the visiting Chinese foreign minister and state councillor Wang Yi in March 2022 that Nepal prefers grants over loans to fund BRI projects. The government also informed that the interest rate should not exceed one percent, there must be a competitive bidding process, and repayment terms for the concessional loan should be similar to those of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other multilateral and bilateral lenders.Our priority is grant, not loan, said Prime Minister Dahal on Tuesday, while echoing the position of the Deuba government.âOur first priority is grants, not loans. If we do need to take loans, we will not pay an interest rate higher than what we are paying to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank,â said Prime Minister Dahal in Parliament on Tuesday, stating Nepal cannot afford beyond 1.5 percent annual interest rate proposed for BRI projects.Nepali Congress lawmakers Prakash Sharan Mahat, Ram Hari Khatiwada, Badri Pandey, and Sishir Khanal of Rastriya Swatantra Party, among others, had asked the government about its efforts to implement the BRI and its implementation plan.âWe are already burdened by debt, so before taking more loans, we have to think twice,â said Mahat. The prime minister also stated that Nepal is mindful of the debt trap. âWe will push the agreement by ensuring that we wonât fall into a debt trap,â the prime minister said. Khatiwada questioned, âWhy isnât the government insisting on grants under the BRI?â The prime minister later clarified any loans taken will not exceed the interest rates paid to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.Multiple officials at the Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that matters related to loans, grants, concessional loans, and other repayment structures have yet to be settled by the two sides. There is a lack of harmonisation between the two sides, although the Nepali side has repeatedly insisted on grant and soft loan from China for various projects under the BRI. The text of the BRI implementation plan outlines several areas of cooperation between Nepal and China. âWe have to go for grants. We need donations, and I have also told the Chinese side that we cannot afford an interest rate beyond 1 or 1.5 percent per annum,â said the prime minister in Parliament. Nepal currently pays a two percent yearly interest rate to Chinaâs EXIM Bank, which funded the construction of the Pokhara International Airport.Khanal of Rastriya Swatantra Party demanded formal discussion and deliberation of the BRI in Parliament.Due to a lack of discussion in Parliament, there is unnecessary and negative discourse outside the House, said Khanal. âWe signed the BRI framework agreement with China in 2017. As we never had proper discussion in the House, there was unnecessary discussion and debate outside. That might invite problems in our relations with China,â he said. The BRI implementation plan got more traction during the China visit of Prime Minister Dahal last year. A joint statement issued after the visit stated that both sides would conclude the negotiations on the BRI implementation plan and prepare for its signing. The National Planning Commission then expedited consultations with various line ministries, particularly with finance and law ministries. âAfter both ministries forwarded their inputs, a new draft emerged,â a minister who is aware of the latest development said. But there are some reservations from the Chinese side regarding the financing and investment modalities, as the prime minister said during Tuesdayâs meeting of the House of Representatives.âNow the signing has been postponed until further notice. But both sides have assured that the plan would be signed during a high-level visit in the near future,â the minister added. Consultation mechanism meeting concludes The 16th meeting of Nepal-China Diplomatic Consultation Mechanism concluded Tuesday. During the meeting, the two sides reviewed the whole gamut of bilateral relations and assessed progress made in the implementation of agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) signed and the decisions made in the past, said the foreign ministry statement. âThey expressed firm commitment to further promote cooperation in mutually agreed areas and committed to work in realisation of economic opportunities for mutual benefits. Both the heads of delegation reiterated that strong foundations of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Panchsheel, mutual trust, goodwill, and understanding remain the guiding features of Nepal-China bilateral relations,â the statement said. Foreign Secretary Lamsal thanked her counterpart for the commitment of the Chinese side to enhancing development cooperation amidst Nepal's LDC graduation in 2026. Likewise, Vice Minister Sun appreciated Nepal's commitment to One China Principle. Both sides shared views on maintaining the tradition of regular exchange of high-level visits, said the statement, and they discussed ways and means to further enhance cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, infrastructure development, connectivity, agriculture, among others. This includes the promotion of Nepalâs tourism prospects in China in the context of celebration of the year 2025 as âVisit Nepal Year in China, according to the foreign ministry. Both sides decided to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between Nepal and China with special programmes and activities in 2025.The two sides stressed the need to further activate the existing bilateral mechanisms and establish new ones, including a joint commission at the level of foreign ministers. The Nepali delegation comprised Joint Secretary and Head of North East Asia Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Krishna Prasad Dhakal and senior officials from relevant ministries and government agencies. Likewise, the Chinese delegation had Ambassador of China to Nepal Chen Song and other senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu.

Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the twoâan independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputyâwouldnât have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the governmentâs intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, âHonourable KP Oli jyu, donât hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].âHe further added, âYou have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.â âIf one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oliâs nod,â Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMCâs ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.âThis should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,â a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayorâs ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, âYour and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,â Dangol remarked. âWe should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.âShe also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. âCity councilâs is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,â Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. âHaving an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.âRajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his âlone-wolfâ manner of leading the institution.âWe should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyoneâs spirit,â Dangol told the council meeting. âIf one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.âShe added, âWhile working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.âAt the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, âWhat if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?âIn September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal governmentâs central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu.

Be it the Chure region, Kaligandaki River, or any other hill or river, such activities have robbed these ecologically sensitive places of their natural beauty and richness. This in turn poses a significant threat to wildlife, environment and humans, and the severity of the risks escalates during the monsoon due to frequent floods and landslides. Yet the Nepali state appears largely unbothered. A recent Post report about the illegal extraction at the Kalakhola area in Baglung Municipality-13, which has put an under-construction âindustrial villageâ and settlements in the area at heightened risk of erosion, captures the disasters such activities can invite. Thanks to haphazard extraction, the Kaligandaki River has reportedly altered its course, increasing the risk of flooding in nearby settlements and affecting the area set aside for industries. This, however, isnât an isolated case. Every year, hundreds of people lose their lives due to landslides brought about by the construction of feeder roads connected to national highways. Roads constructed just above peopleâs roofs have also taken a toll on lives and property. Of course, it is illegal to bulldoze riverbeds and build shoddy roads. In 2020, the Supreme Court banned extraction activities to protect the Kaligandaki and the settlements near the river. Similarly, the Public Road Act (1974), Section 19 prohibits building an access road joined to the public road without permission from the department of roads. Local and provincial governments are mainly responsible for constructing auxiliary roads, while local governments are tasked with monitoring and regulating extraction activities. But the political support for the illegal extractors, localsâ necessity for road connectivity, and, most importantly, the fact that many local level representatives are contractors have made it difficult to stop these illegal activities at the local level. In many cases, local representatives flout the laws and use their excavators to build connecting roads. As a part of the asare vikas, they spend the bulk of the budget only at the end of the fiscal year. Roads, as a result, are built without proper study, environmental impact and need assessment. Federal apathy has further emboldened the illegal extractors and unscrupulous constructors. We should be mindful of what negligence and encroachments can do to our natural resources. On the one hand, the government advocates for environmental protection but on the other, it continues to blatantly overlook the issue. This is perhaps because the extraction of riverbed materials has become a lucrative business. For example, as the country is self-sufficient in cement production, with the capacity to produce 17 million tonnes, the authorities perhaps donât want to lose that point of pride. But peopleâs health and wellbeing should always come first. The pursuit of development and profits should, as such, not overshadow environmental concerns. Now that the monsoon is upon us, many places will see illegal road construction and riverbed extraction. In order to forestall more damage to life and property, the first order of business must be to identify areas where unsustainable extraction has taken place as well as the roads that need immediate repair. Contractors and licensed miners should be mandated to follow the environmental impact guidelines, and if they fail, their licences should be revoked. If the government can hold them to account and implement stringent policies, precious lives and natural resources can be saved. Only by being proactive and factoring in long-term sustainability can we save our environment and protect our wellbeing as well as of the generations to come.Â  ","summary":"Haphazard road construction in hills and illegal riverbed extraction down in the plains have become all too common in Nepal.

As the governments closest to the people, local levels create laws, formulate plans based on local needs and priorities, and efficiently use resources. They operate development projects in a participatory manner, fostering a sense of ownership. Their services include education, health, agriculture, waste management and local dispute resolution. According to Articles 214 and 221 of the 2015 Constitution, executive and legislative powers at the local level are vested in rural and municipal assemblies. The Local Government Operation Act (LG Act) further outlines responsibilities, including local taxes, basic services, development projects and public welfare. According to Section 102 of the LG Act, local levels can create and implement rules, guidelines, procedures and standards within their jurisdiction. The Auditor General of Nepal's 61st report (OAG report) mentions that the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration provided 52 model laws for local operations. However, the Legislative Management Committee of the National Assembly indicates that it needs six more laws for smooth operation.The Federation, Province and Local Level (Coordination and Inter-relation) Act 2020 or the Intergovernmental Relations Law (IGR Law) grant local levels the right to make laws within their exclusive and concurrent rights. Despite these provisions, local levels have not enacted the necessary regulations for effective fiscal resource mobilisation, development and service delivery, which has hindered their performance and service delivery.The IGR Law establishes a Provincial Coordination Council, chaired by the chief minister, to coordinate activities between provinces and local levels in policy coordination, strategic planning, use of shared jurisdiction, and natural resource management. Despite regular meetings, provinces have taken on projects meant for local levels, established redundant provincial offices, and failed to fully transfer funds to local levels. To enhance performance and balance development, provincial governments and local levels must coordinate effectively, holding regular meetings and making decisions to facilitate their tasks under concurrent rights.Regarding financial status, as stated by the OAG report, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022-23, the total revenue of the local level was about Rs672 billion, with 86 percent expenditure. Internal revenue, including revenue sharing (VAT and excise duty sharing), contributed 17 percent. Another 17 percent came from cash balance, i.e., the remaining budget from the previous year. The remaining revenue sources are fiscal transfers. The Ministry of Finance claims that revenue sharing and cash balance should also be counted as fiscal transfers, meaning that over 80 percent of local-level revenue comes from fiscal transfers.In FY 2021-22, the total internal revenue of the local levels was Rs35.75 billion, which declined to Rs33.67 billion in FY 2022-23. This indicates a lack of effort in collecting internal revenue, suggesting heavy dependence on fiscal transfers. In FY 2023-24, local levels received Rs295 billion in grants, which increased to Rs312 billion in FY 2024-25. However, the share of conditional grants rose from 65 percent in FY 2023-24 to 67 percent in FY 2024-25. Despite an overall budget increase of the federal government from Rs1751 billion to Rs1860 billion from FY 2023-24 to FY 2024-25, the unconditional grant to local levels increased by only Rs1 billion. The ratio of fiscal equalisation grants to the total GoN has declined from 14 percent in FY 2018-19 to 9 percent in FY 2024-25.Local levels have autonomy with fiscal equalisation grants, allowing them to choose programs and projects. However, over 80 percent of conditional grants go towards salaries and expenses for school teachers and other sectoral agency staff. The GoN has been reducing fiscal equalisation grants. The OAG report noted that Rs31 billion in fiscal equalisation grants was deducted towards the end of FY 2022-23. Additionally, a cabinet meeting on January 23, 2024, decided to reduce fiscal equalisation grants to sub-federal levels, including local levels, by 26 percent, amounting to Rs38 billion. This situation is deplorable for the local level. After facing intense criticism from the local level, two days ago, the government decided to release local-level funds, still withholding 7 percent of the necessary amount.The LG Act mandates internal audits of financial transactions, which, according to the OAG report, 307 local levels have not yet complied. Additionally, most local levels lack periodical development plans and fail to prepare medium-term expenditure frameworks. These frameworks should detail projected expenditures, required allocations, implementation timelines, funding sources, returns and achievements over three years. The failure to follow these requirements impacts the efficiency and transparency of local financial management.According to the law, local levels must submit their budgets by Ashad 10 (June 24). Most local levels, including Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), presented their budgets. KMC presented a budget amounting to Rs25.63 billion. However, dozens of local levels have not submitted their budgets. As stated in the OAG's report, four to five dozen local levels failed to submit their budgets on time from the very beginning.Legally, budgets must be allocated to specific programmes and projects, not kept in block form. Despite this, 291 local levels reserved Rs7.44 billion in unallocated funds, allowing executives to allocate and spend later, undermining fiscal discipline. This issue also exists at the provincial level. Although not a major issue, it significantly impacts the financial discipline.Section 83 of the LG Act mandates that local levels analyse their jurisdiction and workload and propose permanent job positions based on organisation and management surveys, with no temporary positions allowed. However, 229 local levels have spent Rs1.53 billion on salaries and allowances by appointing personnel on service contracts without established posts. 68.37 percent of local-level projects are under Rs500,000, while only 7.93 percent are over Rs2 million, indicating a prevalence of small projects. This issue is reflected in federal ministries; for example, the Ministry of Urban Development has 99 projects worth Rs100,000 each, and the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has 626 projects worth Rs500,000 each, as reported by Kantipur Daily on June 19, 2024.Local levels are responsible for providing accessible and quality services. However, service delivery has been ineffective due to unfilled staff positions, inadequate infrastructure and geographical challenges. Approximately 250 local levels lack a chief administrative officer, and the Ministry of Federal Affairs reports a shortage of about 30,000 staff due to delays in passing the Civil Service Bill.Additional issues include fragmented planning, fund transfers without implementation, overspending on unproductive programs and non-compliance with procurement laws. Ineffective service delivery also results from inadequate reviews of activities conducted at the local level, private sector, partnerships and civil organisations.Legal provisions exist for financial accountability through public hearings and social audits to ensure transparency and accountability. However, most local levels fail to clarify income and expenditure, performance status and contributions from consumer committees, neglecting public hearings and audits with stakeholders.Section 112 of the LG Act mandates that local levels create and implement a code of conduct for members and employees, covering transparency, accountability and avoiding conflicts of interest. Most local levels have not complied with this requirement. According to the OAG's report, seven local levels have not conducted a final audit or supported the auditing system. Additionally, some local levels failed to conduct audits for FY 2017-18 and FY 2021-22. Local levels neglecting the audit process and essential services should face penalties, such as reductions in their equalisation grants. These grants should be transferred to other local levels within the same province, demonstrating effective work and adherence to rules and regulations.Local levels must address these fiscal and administrative challenges to ensure effective governance and service delivery. Proper coordination with provincial governments, adherence to legal mandates, and a focus on transparency and accountability are essential for improving local governments' performance and trust.

Wade was overturned, there's reason to believe reproductive rights could affect the outcome of the US presidential race.Donald Trump's term as president left a devastating legacy for reproductive rights in the United States.Now, as Trump vies again for the presidency, his anti-abortion stance could come back to bite him.There has been a subtle but noticeable shift among some Republicans away from a hardline anti-abortion stance. And this month, the US Supreme Court rejected a bid to limit access to a common abortion pillâthe latest in a string of wins for reproductive rights in the US.But the extent to which reproductive rights will impact the presidential election result in November will depend on several factors, including whether pro-choice voters go to the polls in sufficient numbers to tip the balance in key states.How Trump damaged reproductive rightsTrump's victory in 2016 has proved to be one of the most consequential events in shaping Americans' reproductive rights in the last 50 years.In that campaign, Trumpâwho once called himself \"the most pro-life president ever\"âpromised to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 US Supreme Court decision that established a person's right to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability.After he took office in 2017, Trump delivered on that pledgeâappointing three justices who, in June 2022, went on to join the six-vote majority that overturned the Roe decision.Following this ruling, Dobbs v. Jackson, old state laws criminalising abortion went back into effect, and some state legislatures have sought new ways to limit access to reproductive care.Fourteen states now criminalise abortion in all circumstances except some medical emergencies, and three others ban the procedure after six weeksâbefore many women even know they are pregnant.More than 29 million women of childbearing age live in states with total or near-total bans on abortion.Despite these dramatic changes to reproductive rights, polls consistently show that fewer than one in five Americans (across all genders) believes abortion should be banned in all circumstances.A 2024 Pew survey found that 63 percent of Americans, including 64 percent of women, believe abortion should be legal in \"all or most cases\".The consequences of the Dobbs decision have mostly been felt in private, as many women are now forced to quietly travel across state lines for reproductive care. But news reports of some high-profile cases have put the spotlight on stories of women being denied terminations of pregnancies that are nonviable or dangerous to the woman's health.A Louisiana woman whose fetus had no skull was forced to travel to New York to terminate her pregnancy. A Texas woman, Kate Cox, was denied an exemption from the state's abortion ban to terminate her pregnancy. Her fetus was afflicted with Trisomy 18, a devastating chromosomal condition that nearly always results in stillbirth or death within the first year of life.Other women and their families worry that medical professionals in states with abortion bans, wary of losing their medical licences or being sued, limit information about dangerous pregnancies to the detriment of their patients.Pro-choice voter stancesGiven this state of affairs, there is much conjecture on what the end of Roe might mean for November's presidential election.The issue of abortion access has proven to drive voter turnout in state elections in the wake of Dobbs.In a series of referenda, voters have sought to protect reproductive rights.In 2022, Kansas and Kentucky voters rejected amendments that would have declared that their state constitutions did not protect abortion rights. Michigan voters added an amendment protecting abortion access to their state's constitution. In November 2023, Ohio residents voted in favour of an amendment to that state's constitution that protects abortion access. These were all states won by Trump in 2016.There is more evidence that the issue of reproductive rights influences the outcomes of elections. In the 2022 midterm elections, support for abortion rights contributed to better-than-expected results for Democratic candidates.A recent Gallup poll shows that 54 percent of voters now identify as pro-choice, while the share of voters who view abortion as \"morally wrong\" has dipped to 37 percent from 50 percent in 2019. The same poll revealed that nearly twice as many voters who favour abortion access say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views on the subject as compared to those who oppose abortion.The increased fervour to protect abortion access is primarily concentrated among those who already vote for Democratic candidates. And midterm elections typically have lower voter turnout than presidential elections.What will happen in November is dependent on whether these voters go to the polls in sufficient numbers to tip the balance in statewide elections. (The United States uses an electoral college system for presidential elections that awards votes to the winner of the popular vote in that state.)At the same time, there is evidence that the fallout from the Dobbs decision is already shaping Republican politics.Abortion bans are not popular with a majority of voters. This has left Republicans on the defensive. There is some evidence that some Republicans are backing away from hardline pro-life stances.Trump himself has not yet clarified his abortion policy during his 2024 campaign. He has said, however, that voters in each state should decide the rules governing abortion, not lawmakers in Washington.In several swing states, pro-choice stances have had success this year.In Arizona, where the state supreme court recently allowed a Civil War-era abortion ban to go back into effect, the legislature recently voted to repeal the law. Both houses of the legislature are controlled by Republicans. Trump won Arizona in 2016, but Biden prevailed there in 2020.Abortion rights will be on the ballot in some other key states in November. In Floridaâanother battleground stateâvoters will decide whether to inscribe abortion access until fetal viability in the state constitution via a referendum. Similar measures will likely be on the ballot in Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, South Dakota and a handful of other states.If the 2022 midterm elections are instructive, it appears that access to reproductive rights will shape at least some state elections this yearâand the flow-on effects may well affect the outcome of the presidential race. ","summary":"Two years since Roe v. Wade was overturned, there's reason to believe reproductive rights could affect the outcome of the US presidential race.Donald Trump's term as president left a devastating legacy for reproductive rights in the United States.Now, as Trump vies again for the presidency, his anti-abortion stance could come back to bite him.There has been a subtle but noticeable shift among some Republicans away from a hardline anti-abortion stance. And this month, the US Supreme Court rejected a bid to limit access to a common abortion pillâthe latest in a string of wins for reproductive rights in the US.But the extent to which reproductive rights will impact the presidential election result in November will depend on several factors, including whether pro-choice voters go to the polls in sufficient numbers to tip the balance in key states.How Trump damaged reproductive rightsTrump's victory in 2016 has proved to be one of the most consequential events in shaping Americans' reproductive rights in the last 50 years.In that campaign, Trumpâwho once called himself \"the most pro-life president ever\"âpromised to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 US Supreme Court decision that established a person's right to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability.After he took office in 2017, Trump delivered on that pledgeâappointing three justices who, in June 2022, went on to join the six-vote majority that overturned the Roe decision.Following this ruling, Dobbs v. Jackson, old state laws criminalising abortion went back into effect, and some state legislatures have sought new ways to limit access to reproductive care.Fourteen states now criminalise abortion in all circumstances except some medical emergencies, and three others ban the procedure after six weeksâbefore many women even know they are pregnant.More than 29 million women of childbearing age live in states with total or near-total bans on abortion.Despite these dramatic changes to reproductive rights, polls consistently show that fewer than one in five Americans (across all genders) believes abortion should be banned in all circumstances.A 2024 Pew survey found that 63 percent of Americans, including 64 percent of women, believe abortion should be legal in \"all or most cases\".The consequences of the Dobbs decision have mostly been felt in private, as many women are now forced to quietly travel across state lines for reproductive care. But news reports of some high-profile cases have put the spotlight on stories of women being denied terminations of pregnancies that are nonviable or dangerous to the woman's health.A Louisiana woman whose fetus had no skull was forced to travel to New York to terminate her pregnancy. A Texas woman, Kate Cox, was denied an exemption from the state's abortion ban to terminate her pregnancy. Her fetus was afflicted with Trisomy 18, a devastating chromosomal condition that nearly always results in stillbirth or death within the first year of life.Other women and their families worry that medical professionals in states with abortion bans, wary of losing their medical licences or being sued, limit information about dangerous pregnancies to the detriment of their patients.Pro-choice voter stancesGiven this state of affairs, there is much conjecture on what the end of Roe might mean for November's presidential election.The issue of abortion access has proven to drive voter turnout in state elections in the wake of Dobbs.In a series of referenda, voters have sought to protect reproductive rights.In 2022, Kansas and Kentucky voters rejected amendments that would have declared that their state constitutions did not protect abortion rights. Michigan voters added an amendment protecting abortion access to their state's constitution. In November 2023, Ohio residents voted in favour of an amendment to that state's constitution that protects abortion access. These were all states won by Trump in 2016.There is more evidence that the issue of reproductive rights influences the outcomes of elections. In the 2022 midterm elections, support for abortion rights contributed to better-than-expected results for Democratic candidates.A recent Gallup poll shows that 54 percent of voters now identify as pro-choice, while the share of voters who view abortion as \"morally wrong\" has dipped to 37 percent from 50 percent in 2019. The same poll revealed that nearly twice as many voters who favour abortion access say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views on the subject as compared to those who oppose abortion.The increased fervour to protect abortion access is primarily concentrated among those who already vote for Democratic candidates. And midterm elections typically have lower voter turnout than presidential elections.What will happen in November is dependent on whether these voters go to the polls in sufficient numbers to tip the balance in statewide elections.

Our institutional infrastructures, public understanding, traditional knowledge and various other setups were accordingly structured. But things have changed significantly. High death toll by snakebite formerly seen in southern parts is being replicated not only in the mid-hills but also in mountainous districts like Sindhupalchowk.Sixteen of the 31 patients admitted to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital on Sunday were rushed there after being bitten by snakes of various kinds. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking medication at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley. Until a decade ago, the hospital hardly saw any snakebite cases from these areas. Last month, people from Sindhupalchowk rushed a man to the hospital to treat a snakebite. He was bitten by a king cobra. According to doctors, the number of patients coming to the hospital from neighbouring districts after being bitten by venomous snakes has significantly increased. This shows deadly snakes like cobras have climbed up not only hills but also into mountainous districts. Mosquitoes, which were also considered a problem of the plains until a few decades ago, have already become a common nuisance for all hill districts. These insects have even reached the high mountainous districts such as Mustang, often hidden among the goods transported there from lowlands. Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, has become endemic in Nepal for the past couple of years. Infection and mortality from it has spiked alarmingly. This year, most districts have already reported dengue cases at the start of the monsoon, even as the post-monsoon period is considered conducive for disease transmission. Last year saw the death of at least 20 persons and infection of over 52,000 by the virus as it spread to all 77 districts of the country.Not only insects, even wild animals including leopards, tigers and other predators have surprised people by appearing in the highlands, where they were considered non-existent. Besides this, extreme weather events and incidents of disasters have become more frequent thanks to the impact of global warming. So the central factor responsible for these shifts is climate change. Global warming has brought seismic changes in this Himalayan country. But our authorities still seem to be in a slumber when it comes to tackling the new pattern of crises and diseases. It has become urgent to upgrade Nepali authoritiesâ understanding about diseases and disasters. Then, our institutional setups need a revamp based on the changed context. For instance, traditionally, hospitals in the hills were not supposed to see a high number of snakebite patients. But things have changed a lot. Now, the health facilities may need a sufficient number of anti-venom vials as well as new training for medical staff there. There are enough indications that our institutions and human resources need to be prepared for truly unprecedented circumstances.

There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rimaâs body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rimaâs house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rimaâs quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepalâs decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepalâs conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepalâs history.Devi Khadkaâs story had haunted me for years. Iâd read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known âfeministâ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, itâs easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, âIâve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.â Yet, some from Nepalâs transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her âpoliticalâ and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. Iâve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, sheâs been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepalâs transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as wellâa way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepalâs transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepalâs wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal playerânot a victim any more, but a leaderâwill strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist. Her film âDeviâ is screening at the DocEdge Festival in New Zealand in June. ","summary":"The day I met Rima (name changed), it was already late morning and she was anxious.

For those who have not seen this change, itâs easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, âIâve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.â Yet, some from Nepalâs transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her âpoliticalâ and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. Iâve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, sheâs been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepalâs transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as wellâa way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepalâs transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepalâs wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal playerânot a victim any more, but a leaderâwill strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist. Her film âDeviâ is screening at the DocEdge Festival in New Zealand in June.

Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. âWith this latest development, the process will now move ahead.âHe said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. âFollowing their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.â The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriersâ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriersâ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrierâs negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victimsâ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrierâs liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrierâs liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrierâs liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepalâs geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepalâs 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepalâs civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepalâs domestic airlinesânine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicoptersâflew 4.15 million passengers in 2023.

Twelve aspirantsânine men and three womenâfiled their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for a treasurer position; and 34 leaders had filed their candidacies for seven positions of secretary.To the question of whether the leaders had deferred the election finding it difficult to pick individuals for available positions, party insiders gave multiple answers.A leader linked the leadership election deferral to the party split in the first week of May.A group of JSP-Nepal leaders split the party and formed the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission registered the new outfit on May 6.The JSP-Nepal led by Yadav on May 13 moved the Supreme Court, accusing the commission of recognising its splinter group as a party without the legal basis.Yadav, in his petition, claimed that the commission had registered the party even without the required 40 percent central members on its side. The top court has ordered the relevant authorities to stall the process until the verdict and the case is still sub judice.The uncertainty prevents the newly formed Rai-led party from expediting its activities in a formal way. Seven of the 12 JSP-Nepal lawmakers in the federal parliament and 30 of the 406 party central committee members are with Rai.The new outfitâs plan to build its organisation at the provincial and local levels is in limbo due to the delayed court process. Leaders from the new party claimed that a large number of leaders and cadres are waiting to join the new organisation. Moreover, they are planning to embrace those aspirants of top positions when they are denied posts in central bodies. Observers of Madhesh politics claimed that the JSP-Nepal was unable to complete its election process with the splinter faction eying to lure its members. However, Manish Kumar Suman, one of the aspirants for general secretary in the JSP-Nepal, denied it. He claimed that the stalled general convention process, including the selection of leaders for office bearers positions, would be completed within a week.âAs per the election commission deadline, we have to complete the whole general convention process within 35 days,â Suman told the Post. âWe will complete the process before the timeframe.âSome political observers say the JSP-Nepal went for the general convention only out of the constitutional compulsion. If the party really wanted to follow the democratic process, it should have allowed the election process to go forward.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates the political parties to hold the general convention at least once in five years.âUpendra Yadav has made himself the JSP-Nepal patron,â Shiva Chandra Chaudhary, a Madhesh political observer, told the Post. âHe can select leaders loyal to him, having been reelected the party chairman. So he stalled the democratic process.âOn the other hand, the new outfitâJanata Samajbadi Partyâtoo has failed to give momentum to the party building process in the six weeks since its inception.The new outfit has gained prominence apparently with the support of the ruling coalition. The Election Commission swiftly registered the new party on May 6 with the name similar to the mother party despite legal ambiguities in the process. The JSP joined the ruling coalition immediately after its formation and supported the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. The Rai-led party has been given a Cabinet minister and a state minister. On Saturday, when the Cabinet made recommendations for ambassadors to eight countries, two nominations went to the new outfitâs supporters. Ambassadors for Saudi Arabia and Spain were appointed in the JSP quotas. Days after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support to the government, the Rai-led JSP gave its trust vote to Dahal and it supported the government in its policies and programmes.Lawmaker Sushila Shrestha of the JSP tried to downplay the difficulties saying that they were carrying out the partyâs activities quietly. âWe are engaged in several activities to strengthen the newly formed party, but we are not visible in the media,â Shrestha claimed. âNext Saturday and Sunday, our partyâs central committee is meeting.â Shrestha claimed that her party is stronger than the JSP-Nepal in the provinces except for Madhesh. âWe have been holding the meetings of provincial committees and are working to make our presence felt in Madhesh Province too.âThough Shrestha claims there are a number of activities within the party, political observers believe that its activities are stagnant due to the case sub judice in the court. âA writ petition in the Supreme Court related to the party split has stalled the new party formation,â Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst, told the Post.Yadav has claimed the commission registered the party despite its failure to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a party split. JSP-Nepal had 406 central committee members at the time of the party split, but the splinter group only had 30 central members with it.The newly formed JSP was registered amid a legal void as the Political Parties Act 2017 was replaced by an ordinance but not revived afterwards. According to the Act, a group of dissidents can split a party and form a new one if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members and at least 40 percent of the partyâs lawmakers.However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, leaving no legal basis for a party split. On June 9, the Supreme Court referred the dispute related to the party to the full bench. ","summary":"Itâs been 10 days since Upendra Yadav got reelected Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) chair unopposed from the partyâs general convention held in Janakpur.Nearly two weeks since the inauguration of the convention and the election of the party chairman, the JSP-Nepal, however, hasnât elected any other office bearers and central committee members so far.Incumbent chief Yadav was declared the party chair unopposed after no one threw their hat in the ring.After Yadavâs reelection on June 12, the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13, was halted saying that all other leaders would be chosen in consensus.Before the party decided to halt the election process, 23 candidatesâ17 men and six womenâhad filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons; six candidates were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirantsânine men and three womenâfiled their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for a treasurer position; and 34 leaders had filed their candidacies for seven positions of secretary.To the question of whether the leaders had deferred the election finding it difficult to pick individuals for available positions, party insiders gave multiple answers.A leader linked the leadership election deferral to the party split in the first week of May.A group of JSP-Nepal leaders split the party and formed the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission registered the new outfit on May 6.The JSP-Nepal led by Yadav on May 13 moved the Supreme Court, accusing the commission of recognising its splinter group as a party without the legal basis.Yadav, in his petition, claimed that the commission had registered the party even without the required 40 percent central members on its side. The top court has ordered the relevant authorities to stall the process until the verdict and the case is still sub judice.The uncertainty prevents the newly formed Rai-led party from expediting its activities in a formal way. Seven of the 12 JSP-Nepal lawmakers in the federal parliament and 30 of the 406 party central committee members are with Rai.The new outfitâs plan to build its organisation at the provincial and local levels is in limbo due to the delayed court process. Leaders from the new party claimed that a large number of leaders and cadres are waiting to join the new organisation. Moreover, they are planning to embrace those aspirants of top positions when they are denied posts in central bodies. Observers of Madhesh politics claimed that the JSP-Nepal was unable to complete its election process with the splinter faction eying to lure its members. However, Manish Kumar Suman, one of the aspirants for general secretary in the JSP-Nepal, denied it. He claimed that the stalled general convention process, including the selection of leaders for office bearers positions, would be completed within a week.âAs per the election commission deadline, we have to complete the whole general convention process within 35 days,â Suman told the Post. âWe will complete the process before the timeframe.âSome political observers say the JSP-Nepal went for the general convention only out of the constitutional compulsion. If the party really wanted to follow the democratic process, it should have allowed the election process to go forward.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates the political parties to hold the general convention at least once in five years.âUpendra Yadav has made himself the JSP-Nepal patron,â Shiva Chandra Chaudhary, a Madhesh political observer, told the Post. âHe can select leaders loyal to him, having been reelected the party chairman. So he stalled the democratic process.âOn the other hand, the new outfitâJanata Samajbadi Partyâtoo has failed to give momentum to the party building process in the six weeks since its inception.The new outfit has gained prominence apparently with the support of the ruling coalition. The Election Commission swiftly registered the new party on May 6 with the name similar to the mother party despite legal ambiguities in the process. The JSP joined the ruling coalition immediately after its formation and supported the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. The Rai-led party has been given a Cabinet minister and a state minister. On Saturday, when the Cabinet made recommendations for ambassadors to eight countries, two nominations went to the new outfitâs supporters. Ambassadors for Saudi Arabia and Spain were appointed in the JSP quotas. Days after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support to the government, the Rai-led JSP gave its trust vote to Dahal and it supported the government in its policies and programmes.Lawmaker Sushila Shrestha of the JSP tried to downplay the difficulties saying that they were carrying out the partyâs activities quietly. âWe are engaged in several activities to strengthen the newly formed party, but we are not visible in the media,â Shrestha claimed. âNext Saturday and Sunday, our partyâs central committee is meeting.â Shrestha claimed that her party is stronger than the JSP-Nepal in the provinces except for Madhesh. âWe have been holding the meetings of provincial committees and are working to make our presence felt in Madhesh Province too.âThough Shrestha claims there are a number of activities within the party, political observers believe that its activities are stagnant due to the case sub judice in the court. âA writ petition in the Supreme Court related to the party split has stalled the new party formation,â Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst, told the Post.Yadav has claimed the commission registered the party despite its failure to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a party split. JSP-Nepal had 406 central committee members at the time of the party split, but the splinter group only had 30 central members with it.The newly formed JSP was registered amid a legal void as the Political Parties Act 2017 was replaced by an ordinance but not revived afterwards. According to the Act, a group of dissidents can split a party and form a new one if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members and at least 40 percent of the partyâs lawmakers.However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, leaving no legal basis for a party split. On June 9, the Supreme Court referred the dispute related to the party to the full bench.

The ninth general convention of CPN-UML held in Kathmandu in 2014 had elected Bhandari a vice-chair of the party. After Bhandari was elected the countryâs President in 2015, she gave up the party membership as mandated by the constitution. She secured the second term in the presidential election following the 2017 parliamentary polls. After Ramchandra Paudel replaced her as the head of state last year, Bhandari has been relieved of duties and has been enjoying state facilities as a former President. Parliamentarians have started asking: Can a former head of state who has been enjoying state perks return to active politics? They have also demanded that the government look into the services provided to the former head of state. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada, who chairs the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, said the government should clarify whether former President Bhandari qualifies for state benefits after renewing her UML membership. Media reports suggest the former President renewed her membership in a political party, Khatiwada said. âAfter the party membership renewal, can she still enjoy state benefits?â he questioned. âWhat is the stateâs take on this?âHe also demanded the government inform Parliament about the arrangements made for the former President.The Constitution of Nepal is silent on whether a former head of state can engage in active politics after leaving office.However, this is a question of constitutional ethics, says Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general.âIf we look at the examples of other countries, a former head of state does not return to active politics, let alone by reclaiming the membership of a party,â Shrestha told the Post. âIt is a question of ethics.â CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Pampha Bhusal said the question of morality only applies to the one who sticks to it. âIf we see the history of Nepal, we find that a person who has become the prime minister has become an ambassador and taken other responsibilities,â Bhusal told the Post. âIt is a personal decision whether to rejoin active politics after serving as the head of state. Letâs not make too big a fuss about this.âHowever, political observers and analysts say that when a person who has been receiving state benefits for their former role returns to active politics, it raises serious questions about that person and the party that gives the membership. Nepal has yet to formulate policies on the perks and benefits to be provided to a former head of state. The current practice is for the Cabinet to decide on such perks, according to an officer at the home ministry. âThe former President gets a monthly stipend of Rs50,000. Another Rs200,000 is provided in monthly house rent,â said the officer. âIf the former President has a house of their own in Kathmandu and decides to stay there, they get Rs100,000 a month in maintenance expenses.â They also get security personnel. However, the ministry officer refused to disclose the âsensitiveâ security details. Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of Nepal, claims funds for housing from the government whereas Bhandari lives in her own house. Even before retiring from presidential duties, Bhandari had decided that she would go back to her own house, fuelling speculations about her plan to return to active politics. Bhandari is the widow of the late communist leader Madan Bhandari, who provided the ideological line to the UML. Most of Nepalâs major communist forces, the Maoist Centre led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the CPN (Unified Socialist) led by Madhav Kumar Nepal acknowledge the role of Madan Bhandari in advancing the communist cause in the country.UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Nepal and Dahal have once been together in a single political party after the 2017 elections. Whenever the communist forces form a coalition, as the three parties are doing now, the issue of their strategic partnership comes up.The Nepal Communist Party (NCP), as the unified force was called, saw a split when Dahal and Oli jointly chaired it but Oli is often criticised for being chiefly responsible for the unified partyâs failure given his leadership style. Now when the three forces are rumoured to be planning to contest the 2027 elections on the same side, the chances of former President Bhandari returning to politics to potentially unite the parties as a leader acceptable to all are said to be high.Bhandari reportedly renewed party membership on the Nepali New Year day, more than two months ago. Madhav Dhungel, the secretary of the central organisation department of the UML, took to social media on June 18 to clarify the issue. âThere is no doubt that Bhandari became President as a UML leader. But then she had to distance herself from the party, and she did so,â reads the facebook status of Dhungel. âHowever, she has the right to provide guardianship to the whole country, the Nepali people and the political party that she nurtured.ââWhether to return to active politics is a personal matter. If she [Bhandari] does so, she wonât do so on the sly,â Dhungel writes. âIf she desires to be active in politics, she will undoubtedly do so in the UML.âOn the question of Bhandari renewing her party membership, Kashinath Adhikari, the head of the partyâs central organisation department, said he was not in a position to give a definite answer. âMembership in our party is renewed at the start of the [Nepali] new year,â Adhikari told the Post. âWho all have renewed party membership will be known only after going through the final list of those doing so in the given time.âÂ  ","summary":"The news of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari renewing her party membership has become a matter of discussion in Parliament.

Among those notably absent were top leaders including Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli and CPN (Unified Socialist) chief Madhav Nepal, as well as several Cabinet ministers and dozens of lawmakers from ruling and opposition benches. Out of 22, only eight ministers were present. A Nepali Congress leader said that Congress President Deuba was briefly present in the House, but had to leave due to health issues. But other senior Congress leaders and office bearers were notably absent. Similarly, CPN-UML chair Oli visited Parliament but did not enter the House. He left Parliament premises before the prime minister started speaking. Oli attended another function in the Capital.Several Cabinet ministers including two deputy prime ministers Raghubir Mahaseth and Narayan Kaji Shrestha were also absent when Dahal was responding to lawmakersâ queries. âThere has been a tradition in Parliament that leaders of both opposition and ruling parties should be present when the prime minister speaks. The absence does not undermine the prime minister but rather the parliamentarians themselves. Except in emergencies, leaders of ruling and opposition parties, ministers and lawmakers traditionally attend the meeting where the prime minister speaks. But this tradition is being watered down, day by day. This definitely does not undermine the prime ministerâs position,â said Dahal.The visibly upset prime minister said before concluding his statement by warning that âif such a trend continues, it is a gross insult to all of us.âBefore making this statement, the prime minister answered questions from eleven lawmakers on various issues. He also discussed his recent visit to India and President Ramchandra Paudelâs visits to Switzerland and Germany.Prime Minister Dahal, earlier this month, attended the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. He also held talks with Indian President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Modi, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, among other top officials.During his meetings with Modi and Jaishanker, Dahal said, issues related to strengthening bilateral ties, activating bilateral mechanisms between Nepal and India, and increasing Indian investment in Nepal, among others, were discussed.While speaking in the House, the prime minister expressed his dissatisfaction with budgetary allocations stating the ministers did not follow his directives.âMinisters should take the prime ministerâs directive seriously while selecting projects and programmes,â said Dahal. âDespite my directives, small and micro projects are still being included in the budget. You will be ministers and prime ministers tomorrow, so we need to correct these practices.ââDespite tall promises, this fiscal yearâs budget has several small and micro level projects below Rs30 million. The government had earlier promised to entrust projects and programmes under Rs30 million to provincial governments. I am not fully satisfied with the budget and its provisions.âWhile responding to lawmakersâ queries, the prime minister said that those responsible for the Tikapur massacre would be punished. As many as eight people, including a toddler and seven policemen, were killed by protesters on August 24, 2015 in the run up to the promulgation of the constitution. Dahal also assured that the government is committed to ensuring the identity and social and economic empowerment of the Tharus and other socially and economically marginalised communities.The prime minister also informed Parliament that Nepal and India are seriously considering two dedicated religious corridorsâthe Ramayana and Buddha circuitsâto promote religious tourism.âWe have ensured the budget for developing Ramayana, Shiva, Buddha, and Kirat circuits,â said the prime minister. âFifteen different religious sites between Nepal and India will be connected under the Ramayana and Buddha circuits.â Nepal and India have already reached agreements and understandings on developing these circuits.Similarly, the prime minister stated that the government is committed to making ambassadorial appointments more orderly, dignified, transparent, and performance-based. He also defended the governmentâs recent decision to recall Nepalâs ambassadors from several countries, stating that the decision was in line with the constitution.The recent decision to recall envoys from 11 nations created quite an uproar in various quarters.âThe government is committed to using diplomatic missions and envoys in the best interest of the nation,â he said. âAs per the Ambassador Appointment Directive, 2015, the envoys can be recalled before completing their terms, if necessary.ââTypically, only those appointed under political quota are recalled immediately after a change in coalition,â the prime minister said. âBut this time, the envoys remained in their posts for more than three months after a change in the ruling coalition.âDahal said this was proof of how the government was serious about the issue.Government picks some ambassadors under political quota based on recommendations from coalition partners while it selects some career diplomats from within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Talking about his recent India visit, Prime Minister Dahal also said that there were discussions on effective implementation of the agreements reached between the two South Asian neighbours.According to Dahal, among the issues discussed during a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, were strengthening Nepal-India relations, implementation of past agreements, and bilateral discussionsâincluding border disputes. âThere were serious discussions on the implementation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, Arun Hydropower Project and cooperation in the agricultural sector,â Dahal said.Likewise, the prime minister stated that the government has initiated the formation of a high-level committee to address the challenges being faced by cooperatives.After the committeeâs input and suggestions, crisis-ridden cooperatives will be identified and action initiated to return deposits and manage their assets.Dahal said that more than Rs772.44 million has already been refunded to the victims of cooperatives.Addressing the meeting, Dahal stated that 59,587 individuals, affected by cooperatives, had filed complaints alleging embezzlement of deposits totalling Rs36.28 billion. Of this, the government has so far paid back Rs 772.44 million.The prime minister added that the government had declared 20 different cooperatives as âcrisis-riddenâ and that the process of refunding affected depositors was being facilitated through the Crisis-ridden Cooperative Management Committee.Dahal also mentioned that efforts are underway for a separate legal procedure to establish an independent regulatory body to protect cooperative savings.âThe government is aware of the problems faced by cooperatives and is serious about addressing them. Various efforts have been made to implement the suggestions of the high-level task force and agreements reached with the cooperative victims under the coordination of the National Planning Commission last year,â he said.Prime Minister Dahal said that a committee had also been formed at the provincial and local levels to solve the problems of those affected by cooperatives.A law to establish an authority to regulate and supervise large-scale cooperatives is also being drafted, Dahal said. âNot all cooperatives are in trouble. Many have helped lift peopleâs livelihoods while operating based on established international practices and as per the law,â Dahal said.He added that despite the significant increase in the number of cooperatives, there were plenty of shortcomings in their qualitative improvement. ","summary":"Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Thursday expressed his deep frustration over the low attendance of lawmakers and senior party leaders during his question and answer session in the House of Representatives.While low attendance in the House is not uncommon, as per the tradition, almost all lawmakers and senior leaders, except those with urgent commitments, are present when the prime minister speaks in the House or organises a question-answer session on contemporary issues.âThe absence does not undermine the post of prime minister, it undermines the lawmakers themselves,â said Prime Minister Dahal, who was visibly distressed. Among those notably absent were top leaders including Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli and CPN (Unified Socialist) chief Madhav Nepal, as well as several Cabinet ministers and dozens of lawmakers from ruling and opposition benches. Out of 22, only eight ministers were present. A Nepali Congress leader said that Congress President Deuba was briefly present in the House, but had to leave due to health issues. But other senior Congress leaders and office bearers were notably absent. Similarly, CPN-UML chair Oli visited Parliament but did not enter the House. He left Parliament premises before the prime minister started speaking. Oli attended another function in the Capital.Several Cabinet ministers including two deputy prime ministers Raghubir Mahaseth and Narayan Kaji Shrestha were also absent when Dahal was responding to lawmakersâ queries. âThere has been a tradition in Parliament that leaders of both opposition and ruling parties should be present when the prime minister speaks. The absence does not undermine the prime minister but rather the parliamentarians themselves. Except in emergencies, leaders of ruling and opposition parties, ministers and lawmakers traditionally attend the meeting where the prime minister speaks. But this tradition is being watered down, day by day. This definitely does not undermine the prime ministerâs position,â said Dahal.The visibly upset prime minister said before concluding his statement by warning that âif such a trend continues, it is a gross insult to all of us.âBefore making this statement, the prime minister answered questions from eleven lawmakers on various issues. He also discussed his recent visit to India and President Ramchandra Paudelâs visits to Switzerland and Germany.Prime Minister Dahal, earlier this month, attended the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. He also held talks with Indian President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Modi, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, among other top officials.During his meetings with Modi and Jaishanker, Dahal said, issues related to strengthening bilateral ties, activating bilateral mechanisms between Nepal and India, and increasing Indian investment in Nepal, among others, were discussed.While speaking in the House, the prime minister expressed his dissatisfaction with budgetary allocations stating the ministers did not follow his directives.âMinisters should take the prime ministerâs directive seriously while selecting projects and programmes,â said Dahal. âDespite my directives, small and micro projects are still being included in the budget. You will be ministers and prime ministers tomorrow, so we need to correct these practices.ââDespite tall promises, this fiscal yearâs budget has several small and micro level projects below Rs30 million. The government had earlier promised to entrust projects and programmes under Rs30 million to provincial governments. I am not fully satisfied with the budget and its provisions.âWhile responding to lawmakersâ queries, the prime minister said that those responsible for the Tikapur massacre would be punished. As many as eight people, including a toddler and seven policemen, were killed by protesters on August 24, 2015 in the run up to the promulgation of the constitution. Dahal also assured that the government is committed to ensuring the identity and social and economic empowerment of the Tharus and other socially and economically marginalised communities.The prime minister also informed Parliament that Nepal and India are seriously considering two dedicated religious corridorsâthe Ramayana and Buddha circuitsâto promote religious tourism.âWe have ensured the budget for developing Ramayana, Shiva, Buddha, and Kirat circuits,â said the prime minister. âFifteen different religious sites between Nepal and India will be connected under the Ramayana and Buddha circuits.â Nepal and India have already reached agreements and understandings on developing these circuits.Similarly, the prime minister stated that the government is committed to making ambassadorial appointments more orderly, dignified, transparent, and performance-based.

They split the party protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oliâs decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice.Following a poor performance in the 2022 elections, where it failed even to secure the status of the national party, the CPN (Unified Socialist) is now struggling to retain party members. Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders are finding it difficult even to stop its members from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.Amid the diminishing influence, the party is gearing up for the general convention scheduled for June 30 to July 4 in Kathmandu.If the claims recently made by the leaders are anything to go by, the two former prime ministersâNepal and Khanalâwill face each other for the position of party chief during the general convention. Both of the leaders also led the CPN-UML in the past.Khanal on Monday emphasised the need of electing the party leadership through a consensus.While addressing the event to launch âMahila Sankalpa-2â, which is the mouthpiece of the partyâs womenâs wing, All Nepal Womenâs Association, Khanal stressed the need for a consensual election of the leaders. However, a certain criteria of leadership should be followed, Khanal said.âTo strengthen the leadership within the party, we must select the leaders of the party through a consensus,â Khanal said during the programme. âSince our party was formed on the basis of an ideological ground, political direction, and certain policies and principles, we all should strive to maintain these values while selecting the leadership as well.âA party insider claimed that Khanal staked his claim for the top position as his political line was adopted in the political document to be presented in the general convention. Party general secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal prepared the political document to be presented in the general convention of the party. While in the UML, party chair Nepal embraced Madan Bhandariâs Peopleâs Multi-party Democracy unconditionally for many years while Khanal and Bhusal viewed it critically. According to party leaders, Khanal and Bhusal have succeeded in including their ideas in the Unified Socialistâs official line.âIn politics, the leaders whose policies prevail as the partyâs official line should get the opportunity to lead the party,â a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. âThough the political document of the party is guided by the thoughts of general secretary Bhusal, Khanal also owns it, so he is claiming the leadership.âThis does not mean that party chair Nepal has not owned the political document passed by the party's central committee, but the document is closer to the political line advocated by Bhusal and Khanal for a long time, said a party insider.Party chair Nepal, while addressing the same programme on Monday, also said that there are no differences among the leaders in terms of the partyâs ideological line. âThe preparation of the political, organisational and other documents to be presented in the upcoming congress is a collective effort of party leaders and cadres,â Nepal said.In addition to Nepal and Khanal, the party's general secretary Bhusal is also considering contesting for the party chair in the upcoming congress, though he has not publicly announced it yet.âMatters related to the aspiration of the leaders for the post of office bearers will be clear only after the selection of convention representatives,â Jeevan Ram Shrestha, the secretary of the party, told the Post. âBefore the selection of the representatives, all things that have come from the media are mere speculation.âThe party has decided to select general convention representatives from around the country on Wednesday. Shrestha said that the selection of representatives will make things clearer about the aspirantsâ claims.Khanal has already opened his contact office at Baneshwar with a plan to manage his teamâs activities during the general convention.Though Khanal has opened his contact office, he may or may not contest for the vital post, says another leader of the party who does not want to disclose his identity. The leader said that it might be under his publicity strategy. âIf the political scenario is not in his favour, Khanal might back Bhusal for the leadership of the party to challenge Nepal,â the leader claimed. âOn the other hand, Nepal, the present chair of the party, might also back Bhusal if he senses a tough challenge from Khanal.âBhusal has remained tightlipped about his candidacy in view of the situation, a leader close to Bhusal said. âIf the two top leaders decide to face each other, Bhusal might settle with his current position of general secretary.âThe partyâs deputy general secretaries, Jagan Nath Khatiwada and Parkash Jwala, have already announced their bid for the post of general secretary.The party will most likely select the leadership through consensus, says another leader. Meanwhile, there are voices in favour of continuing present chair Nepal in the position saying that he has put utmost efforts to establish the party after the split and sustain it amid a challenging situation. But there are also leaders who want Khanalâs leadership.âOne of the two leaders will possibly lead the party,â Unified Socialist leader Som Prasad Pandey, who is close to Nepal, told the Post. âThough Bhusalâs name is also in the discussion for the post of chair, he is most likely to continue as the general secretary.âMeanwhile, former CPN-UML vice-chair Bhim Rawal, who has remained inactive in the UML after the party's convention held in November 2021 in Chitwan, is reportedly considering joining the Unified Socialist from the upcoming congress. In 2021, Rawal challenged Oli for the position of party chair despite Oliâs request not to do so. Since then, Rawal has been given no role in the UML.âOur party is in talks with Bhim Rawal to bring him to the party. We have already held two rounds of negotiation with him,â Shrestha, the secretary, told the Post. âIf everything goes as planned, Rawal will join our party with a respectable position.âThe Postâs attempts to contact Rawal to confirm Shresthaâs claim were unsuccessful.

Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.âMayor Balendra Shahâs initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general publicâs convenience,â Sharma told the House. âMayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.âThe conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the partyâs general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal governmentâs intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.âThe recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,â KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. âEither we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.âAs the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shahâs plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agencyâs intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oliâs involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMCâs Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estateâs liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oliâs involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. âParty lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,â Bishwokarma said. ","summary":"Days after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Roadâsomething the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.âMayor Balendra Shahâs initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general publicâs convenience,â Sharma told the House. âMayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.âThe conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the partyâs general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal governmentâs intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units.

India is the biggest buyer of Nepalâs large cardamom, absorbing 99 percent of its exports. The spice is re-exported to Pakistan and the Middle East, where it fetches high prices because of local preference for Nepali products.Pakistan is the largest importer of large cardamom, purchasing roughly 60 percent of Indiaâs exports. Pakistanis use large cardamom pods in biryani, a famous fried rice dish, to symbolise prosperity and wealth.Nepali traders have also been trying to export large quantities of cardamom to Bangladesh directly through the Kakarbhitta-Panitanki-Phulbari route as demand has increased.The 44-km route provides the shortest access to the Bangladeshi border point of Banglabandha for Nepalâs trade with and through Bangladesh.Nepali large cardamom or black cardamom has a distinct flavour profile due to a specific method of postharvest drying in bhattis (ovens), which explains the roasted smell and taste.The smoky flavour would overwhelm a sweet cake or pudding, but in a spice rub for roasted meat or a full-flavoured stew, it imparts a smouldering depth no other spice can, according to experts.Pakistan and Bangladesh are member countries of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), under which there is a provision for zero duty on agricultural goods.However, these countries impose tariffs and para-tariffs, including regulatory and supplementary duties that make exports expensive.âAs a result, tariff goes as high as 60 percent on large cardamom,â said Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, the Kathmandu-based trade think tank. Indra Chand Bindal, senior vice president of the Large Cardamom Entrepreneurs Association of Nepal, said Pakistan imposes a 42 percent duty and Bangladesh 35 percent, among other charges, discouraging Nepali large cardamom from being exported to these neighbours. âPakistani traders ask to send the product by under-invoicing it, but we cannot do it as it is against our trade.âOn Monday, at a panel discussion during the âNational Conference on Large Cardamom: Present Status, Opportunities and Challengesâ in Kathmandu, Bindal said that Bangladeshâs demand for large cardamom has been increasing.âBut Bangladesh imposes 5-7 different duties resulting in a total of 89 percent tariff. Thatâs massive for any trade to thrive.âAccording to the association, large Nepali cardamom is exported to Bangladesh via Bhutan due to zero tariff schemes for Bhutan. The association said about 45 percent of large cardamom goes to Pakistan via Dubai through India. âBesides high duty, under-value LC (under invoice) and collective trademark are the key problems.âNepal is the worldâs biggest producer of large cardamom, with a 68 percent share of the global market, but traders said it has yet to fully realise its export potential. The traders said that transit is another major problem hindering significant cardamom export. Exporting large cardamom to Pakistan through India is difficult.Bindal said large cardamom takes 45-60 days to reach Pakistan via the Kolkata Port. âIf we are provided with Mumbai port, our product will reach in 10 days.âLarge cardamom traders said the government needs to forward the issues and negotiate a reduction in duty charges through diplomatic channels to ease the export process.During the discussion, the traders said that if the production and quality of large cardamom are increased, Nepal's export potential would easily reach Rs15 billion in the upcoming years.Large cardamom is cultivated predominantly in four districts of eastern NepalâTaplejung, Panchthar, Ilam, and Sankhuwasabhaâwhich account for 87.04 percent of national production. Around 125,000 households are engaged in growing it.In fiscal 2021-22, Koshi province harvested 13,904 hectares and produced 7,645 tonnes of large cardamom.Rabindra Duwadi, information officer of the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said many of the targets set in Nepal Trade Integrated Strategies, 2016, and Nepal National Sector Export Strategy for Large Cardamom 2017-2021 have yet to be achieved.Duwadi said that large cardamom contributed 5.2 percent of the total export share last fiscal year.Duwadi said that Gulf countries are a huge potential market for Nepali large cardamom, but there is no export in those countries at all. âThe traders are not willing to take risks by exporting to those countries as the Indian market is assured for them.â Exporting large quantities of cardamom to European Union countries and the US market is not easy, as they have stricter rules regarding the import of food products.The traders said that the production of large cardamom has been declining in recent years however, trade value is increasing due to rising prices.According to the association, the price of âjumbo jet large cardamomâ was Rs90,000 per 40 kg on Monday.

The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.âThe pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,â she says. âI canât count the number of times that Iâve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,â bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, sheâs noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.âWomen who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,â says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.âI can barely walk when Iâm on my periods, but Iâve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,â she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. âIâm incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,â says Ekta. âI canât study, canât work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,â she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.âThey just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,â Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the âmissed diseaseâ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan.

However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the worldâs most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year.

The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year.

Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.âWe should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,â said Ojha. âThe faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.â ","summary":"Last month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite.

A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factorsâtobacco and alcohol consumptionâand biological risk factorsâraised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.âFor many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,â said Anil. âTo reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.âMany patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity.

The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.The report showed some improvement in the countryâs overall nutrition status, but progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wastingâthe most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for oneâs height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.The report shows that exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining, from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent last year. Health officials said that studies show that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies.According to the report, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing mothersâ education, from 12 percent among those whose mothers have no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile at 46 percent and lowest in the lowest quintile at 11 percent.Likewise, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province at 11 percent, in Madhesh Province at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province at 43 percent.Exclusive breastfeeding is the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provincesâ74 percent eachâand the lowest in Lumbini Provinceâ36 percent.âWe have allocated the nutrition budget to launch a nationwide awareness drive about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the upcoming fiscal year,â said Thapa. âWe have also designated a nutrition focal person at every local unit who is tasked to discourage practices of promoting replacement feeding.âThe report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared with 12 percent of those born at home. Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children, according to the World Health Organisation.Health ministry officials hoped that training for nurses and paramedics would help lessen bottle-feeding practices in health facilities.Doctors say breastfeeding should continue for the first two years or beyond, as breast milk lowers childrenâs risk of illness, promotes their recovery during illness, and remains an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. ","summary":"In a bid to address the problem of malnutrition in children under five, the Ministry of Health and Population has started imparting training to nurses and paramedics serving in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Officials hope that a week-long training programme will help lessen the existing problems of malnutrition in those provinces.âImparting training to combat malnutrition in small children is our nationwide programme, which we have started from Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces,â said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. âAlong with imparting training to health workers, we will also launch an awareness drive to improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.âMalnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.The report showed some improvement in the countryâs overall nutrition status, but progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wastingâthe most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for oneâs height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.The report shows that exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining, from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent last year. Health officials said that studies show that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies.According to the report, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing mothersâ education, from 12 percent among those whose mothers have no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile at 46 percent and lowest in the lowest quintile at 11 percent.Likewise, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province at 11 percent, in Madhesh Province at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province at 43 percent.Exclusive breastfeeding is the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provincesâ74 percent eachâand the lowest in Lumbini Provinceâ36 percent.âWe have allocated the nutrition budget to launch a nationwide awareness drive about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the upcoming fiscal year,â said Thapa. âWe have also designated a nutrition focal person at every local unit who is tasked to discourage practices of promoting replacement feeding.âThe report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared with 12 percent of those born at home. Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children, according to the World Health Organisation.Health ministry officials hoped that training for nurses and paramedics would help lessen bottle-feeding practices in health facilities.Doctors say breastfeeding should continue for the first two years or beyond, as breast milk lowers childrenâs risk of illness, promotes their recovery during illness, and remains an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessityâa space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an âoasisâ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. Itâs a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.âIn developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,â says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyoneâqueer and non-queer alikeâto share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.âI didnât want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,â Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikariâs identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. âAt first, I didnât understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,â Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding oneâs identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldnât afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.âDuring my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,â Adhikari says.âThe time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.âFour years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the cafÃ© because of its welcoming atmosphere.âItâs heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like âDahi Chiura Khane din,ââ she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. âI hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I donât think weâd have any other place to turn to,â she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, âThis is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesnât exist here. Itâs where even those who arenât accepted at home can feel accepted.âSahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmanduâs first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. âAs an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.âThe welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the cafÃ© and appreciates the importance of such spaces.âPreviously, I didnât know much about the queer community and didnât care much. But now, coming into this cafÃ©, Iâve been interested in their rights and issues. Iâve realised that weâre not so different after all. We are all human,â he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.âLike how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,â he says.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot âAbout Dry Grassesâ, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happeningâto what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say âlifeâs turning point?â How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.âHow much oxygen do you need for the summit?â sounds more like âHow much do you need to hold on to life?â How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, âIs this journey worth this much?âI had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my fatherâs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered natureâs masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like âHow will I endure?â and âHow will I finish?â started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of âGodsâ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just thereâbefore and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled âMy Soul Beyond the Mountainâ.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. ","summary":"âHow much oxygen do you have for the summit?âI think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot âAbout Dry Grassesâ, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happeningâto what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say âlifeâs turning point?â How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.âHow much oxygen do you need for the summit?â sounds more like âHow much do you need to hold on to life?â How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, âIs this journey worth this much?âI had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my fatherâs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered natureâs masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like âHow will I endure?â and âHow will I finish?â started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of âGodsâ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just thereâbefore and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colomboâs Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resortâs expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the islandâs famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lionâs Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. âThatâs a better figure now as we are recovering.âThe travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the UkraineâRussia war, and Chinaâs zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the countryâs GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the worldâs best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.âTourism is gaining momentum,â says Somasiri. âThe British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.âJanuary-August is the peak season for foreigners. âFrom December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,â says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, âDon't take selfies with your back to Buddha.â Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.âThese infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the countryâs dry zone,â says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrewâs, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lankaâs hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as âLittle Englandâ. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sitaâs whereabouts.In Ella, Ravanaâs waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasnât crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galleâs 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.âThe main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,â says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.âWe have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,â added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. âWe have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,â says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.âThe other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,â says Pathirana.

The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. âWe have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,â says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.âThe other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,â says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki MandirâJanaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earthâthe Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10Â°c to 20Â°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the worldâs third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the schoolâto quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. Itâs the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leaderâs birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidimâs lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldnât help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughterâsymbols of my childhood.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. âBaraâ means big, and âImambaraâ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal eraâs artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldnât help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawabâs vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosqueâs serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hallâknown as Asafi HallâI was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. Whatâs even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambaraâthe labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the mazeâs design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, âNow, you understand why they say that walls have ears.âExiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monumentâs historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didnât surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasnât just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phoneâs flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the wellâs water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the waterâs surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the wellâs design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture beforeâit is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the mazeâs design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, âNow, you understand why they say that walls have ears.âExiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monumentâs historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didnât surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasnât just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phoneâs flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the wellâs water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the waterâs surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the wellâs design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture beforeâit is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

A spokesperson for Assange in Australia declined to comment on his flight plans. VistaJet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, has been pressing for Assangeâs release but declined to comment on the legal proceedings as they were ongoing.âPrime Minister Albanese has been clear - Mr Assangeâs case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration,â a government spokesperson said.A lawyer for Assange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.HISTORIC CHARGESWikiLeaks in 2010 released hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washingtonâs wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - the largest security breaches of their kind in US military history - along with swaths of diplomatic cables.Assange was indicted during former President Donald Trumpâs administration over WikiLeaksâ mass release of secret US documents, which were leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former US military intelligence analyst who was also prosecuted under the Espionage Act.The trove of more than 700,000 documents included diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts such as a 2007 video of a US Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff. That video was released in 2010.The charges against Assange sparked outrage among his many global supporters who have long argued that Assange as the publisher of Wikileaks should not face charges typically used against federal government employees who steal or leak information.Many press freedom advocates have argued that criminally charging Assange represents a threat to free speech.âA plea deal would avert the worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day,â said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of free speech organisation Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.âIt will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.âLONG ODYSSEYAssange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a European arrest warrant after Swedish authorities said they wanted to question him over sex-crime allegations that were later dropped. He fled to Ecuadorâs embassy, where he remained for seven years, to avoid extradition to Sweden.He was dragged out of the embassy in 2019 and jailed for skipping bail. He has been in London's Belmarsh top security jail ever since, from where he has for almost five years been fighting extradition to the United States.Those five years of confinement are similar to the sentence imposed on Reality Winner, an Air Force veteran and former intelligence contractor, who was sentenced to 63 months after she removed classified materials and mailed them to a news outlet.While in Belmarsh Assange married his partner Stella with whom he had two children while he was holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum Eastâa close-knit settlement of 425 housesâwas considered the Maoistsâ âbase areaâ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. âYouths started going to America about six-seven years ago,â he said. âIf they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.â Budhaâs own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the USâa country that the Maoists used to call their âenemyâ, an âimperialistic forceâ. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditorsâ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. âAfter the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldnât live in the village peacefully,â said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, âWhen will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!âDhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. âNow we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlalâs trip abroad],â Nanda Kala said. âThereâs no point staying here.âStories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. âItâs not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,â he said. âI aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.âFor six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. âWhen I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,â he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupakâs wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.âI still donât know what exactly happened,â said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupakâs trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, âI only have memories.âLack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, âWorkers of the world, unite!â, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, thereâs nothing he can do. âHow could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?â he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didnât herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. âMeter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,â he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dangâs Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. âOnly those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,â he said.One can infer from Pandeyâs statements that the families of such illegal travellers donât want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesnât include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the âbase areasâ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. âThis is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,â Shrestha said. âThe Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.â Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgencyâs âbase areasâ is due to the political systemâs abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. âThe traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,â he said. âDevelopments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.â(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

It is also mentioned in the parable of Jesus in the Bible. Yet, this idiom should be rephrased into âold medicine in new bottlesâ. Iâm no connoisseur of drinks, yet I know that maturing over time enhances the quality of alcohol: Its aroma, taste and colour become more affluent. But date-expired medicine is useless, if not toxic. So, why not say, âold medicine in new bottlesâ instead? Iâm alluding here to Nepalâs potentially alternative politics. I wish to consider the potential efficaciousness of this new and alternative politics that, in many peopleâs minds, has a bright future in the days ahead. It is believed that the support for the established partiesâNepali Congress, UML, Maoistâis rapidly eroding, thus creating a space for the new parties and leaders to emerge. Weâve already seen signs of that, especially with the impressive rise of Rabi Lamichhaneâs Rastriya Swatantra Party and that of Balendra Shah and Harka Sampang as mayors of two prominent towns in Nepal. But I have few hopes even from these new players. They donât have much to offer, especially in terms of attacking the caste hierarchy and ritual pollution that have dominated and dehumanised Dalits for a very long time. Zero interest in Dalit issuesAll the older and established partiesâbig or small, communist or democraticâhave stopped talking about the entrenched problem of caste hierarchy and untouchability. Even Dalit leaders attached to these parties have opted to remain silent. This total apathy all around has angered ordinary Dalits greatly. But sadly, thereâs little concern on the part of the new parties and leaders as well. I recently had a window of opportunity to understand the utter lack of interest in Dalit issues amongst the champions of so-called alternative politics. It was a small gathering hosted by the Nepal Samajbadi Party, led by former Maoist ideologue and Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai, in Kathmandu. Keen to ally with the new groups, Bhattarai purposely didnât invite representatives of the older and established parties.There was a sort of informal debate and discussion on the need for an alternative political power to tackle the countryâs burning issues and open new highways for the nationâs durable peace and prosperity. Fighting corruption was a major concern, of course. However, it seemed they sought an alternative to everything except caste hierarchy and untouchability.Controversial Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, Cambridge-educated CK Raut, Tharu leader Resham Chaudhary, youth leader Ranju Darshana, some independent writers and thinkers, and ethnic activists were among the speakers. They didnât even mention Dalit and untouchability, let alone raise the matter forcefully. This showed how, even among the new and younger political players, the persistent plights of Dalits donât count as a problem. I was equally surprised that the organisers did not incorporate a single Dalit speaker. They may make the excuse that one of their vice chairpersons is a Dalit, who read out the partyâs official document outlying its commitments and pledges for the future. But she, too, didnât mention anything about the need to tackle the multifarious problems of her community. Neither did the official paper commit to ending caste hatred and humiliation.Why so apathetic?There are multiple reasons for the parties, including those professing to lead the charge of alternative politics, being so unsympathetic towards Dalits. I briefly discuss some of those causal factors here.First, the ground realities vis-Ã -vis electoral politics make it almost imperative for any politician to keep oneâs mouth shut on controversial and sensitive issues such as caste and casteism. When parties fiercely compete for popular supportâfrom the federal parliament to the provincial assemblies to local bodiesâthey fear losing votes if they do anything people donât like. This reality becomes stark in a society where caste is sacred, where people are willing to risk their lives in order to prevent their deities from being offended through the transgression of caste rulesâand where religious and cultural values on caste segregation trump modern legal requirements. Second, as in older parties, most leaders of the new parties belong to the upper or locally influential castes. Moreover, they are often conservative Hindus: Rabindra Mishra (formerly BBC Nepali Service chief) is an extreme case. Mishra returned from London seeking alternative politics, but his views turned out to be so âHindubadiâ and monarchist that he was driven out of his own party and forced to embrace the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. Itâs easy to single out Mishra, but in their heart of hearts, most other leaders are no different from him. Rabi Lamichhane is witty and wiley, but his true ideology is still unclear. However, there are clear indications of his conservative Hindu leanings and interest in restoring the old order. In a society governed by Manubadi psychology, people from the lower rungs rarely get selected or elected to influential positions. People like CK Raut, Shah and Sampang may be exceptions here, as they belong to the lower middle ranks in the social hierarchy. But they seem no less casteist in practice. We know that Raut is highly religious, and so seems Shah. In any case, none of the above has thus far raised a serious voice against caste hierarchy and the persistent plight of 13.5 percent of the population considered Dalitsâneither in parliament, town hall meetings, nor public gatherings. Shah has implemented many new and effective policies to improve his town, but he doesnât seem bothered by many Dalits having to rent their properties using fake surnames, for instance. This has been a significant issue for many Dalit renters in the Kathmandu Valley. The same is true of Sampang in Dharan. This eastern Gurkha town isnât quite as casteist as Kathmandu and many other towns, but the problems persist here too. Possible solutionGiven Nepalâs electoral system and the predominance of the upper or influential castes, both in federal and local politics, Dalit issues will continue to be swept under the carpet. Unless, of course, something is done to change things.Dalits must stop choosing between established and newer parties between older and younger leaders. The colour and size of the bottle donât matter when the content is basically the same. Those Dalits supporting Lamichhane and Raut are committing the same mistakes as those working for Deuba, Oli and Dahal. Those seeking a genuine social transformation must urgently give up party politics altogether, delink themselves from upper-caste leaders and create a political space of their own. Only an alternative political force under the leadership of the Dalits themselves, their ideologies and strategies will end this seemingly never-ending silence on and neglect of Dalit issues. This new group should be completely nonpartisan and have zero influence from major parties. Independence is the key, both ideologically and organisationally. Most importantly, the new and independent political organisation must refrain from electoral politics. With Dalit communities spread so thinly, thereâs not much hope of electoral success. Even if the Dalits managed to win a few seats in parliament, this wouldnât deliver anything to society. Mayawati couldnât substantially reduce the force of caste hatred and violence in her state of Uttar Pradesh even after becoming the chief minister four times! So, itâs imperative to work towards forming a genuine alternative to current Dalit politics instead of being awed by some new kids on the block!Â Â  ","summary":"The idiom âold wine in new bottlesâ is old but still famous.

The electoral victories of Narendra Modi in 2014, Donald Trump in 2016, Jair Bolsonaro in 2019 and the gradually emboldened far-right in Europe clearly suggest a crisis in liberal democracy. This phenomenon permeates global politics, threatening the current world order in the form of tumults, wars, recessions and a multitude of other crises. However, the interesting question is why polarisation benefits only rightists and not others.The United States will elect a new president by the end of this year. However, candidates from both the Democratic and Republican parties are old figures, and there is no excitement or expectation from them. Biden, 82, wants to retain the White House; Trump, 79, hopes to return. Since their policies have dominated US politics for the last decade, it is almost certain what Biden and Trump will do if either of them is reelected. Biden will continue his conventional and centrist policies, and Trump will bring rightist and fascist policies into the mainstream. The significant difference between them is that Trump is a more unpredictable and polarising figure than Biden.There are four major polarising agendas in US politics that benefit Trump. First, Americans have been deeply divided into Pro-Roe v. Wade and anti-Roe camps. Ostensibly, this issue is not that serious since it is merely about abortion rights. Still, its interpretation and implications take it into the core of the left and right political ideologies. Religion/Bible, ethics and individual rights have come to the centre of this debate.Second, US politics has been deeply polarised amid the unprecedented migration crisis. The US is known as a country of migrants. However, floods of refugees from the southern border have become a serious political issue. Biden seems to have failed to address this problem and instead buys the solution offered by Trump, i.e., building the wall on the southern border. Furthermore, whatever solutions he has brought will benefit him in the elections.Third, amid the long income stagnation, the meteoric rise of the wealth of a few individuals has engendered frustration, anger and dissatisfaction among voters. This has also caused disorientation in American society. Despite the Biden administration boasting of creating employment and taking control of inflation, people have felt no qualitative change in their lives. In fact, they blame Biden for not creating equal opportunities in health, education and housing. This widespread disenchantment is going to favour Trump in the upcoming election.Fourth, foreign policy is another crucial polarising factor in the US. Despite China's policy seeming to unite, the Israeli policy has divided the nation. Israel has metamorphosed into a fascist state under US patronage and the premiership of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it is committing genocide against Palestinians. After October 7, when Hamas-affiliated terrorists attacked Israel, there has been continuous bombardment, land invasion and indiscriminate killing of women and children. The US policy to provide military assistance and security guarantees to Israel has divided the US into two camps: pro-Palestine and pro-Israel. This polarisation has hurt the centrist Biden, while one camp of his supporters wants him to stop the war on Gaza. These supporters call themselves ânon-committedâ. This is also going to benefit Trump in the elections.Another front of this global polarisation is Europe. Far-right political parties have been emboldened. They do not shy away anymore from advocating their anti-migrant, racist and xenophobic agenda. The European Union's recent parliamentary election starkly demonstrates this polarisation. Marine Le Pen's party, National Rally, has become the biggest party representing France in the EU parliament, winning 32 percent of the votes. President Emmanuel Macron has called for a snap election due to the humiliating performance of his Party, Renaissance. However, this decision seems to have given the far-right the much-needed opportunity. Germany is not an exception. The performance of the centrist ruling Social Democratic Party of Germany and its coalition partners was poor, and the far-right Alternative for Germany is taking hold with 16 percent of the votes.India is another interesting case in which political polarisation is seen. Narendra Modi has become Prime Minister for a consecutive third term. His anti-minority, Hindu supremacist and majoritarian politics have not been defeated even after a decade-long experiment. His party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won 240 seats in the recent elections, making it the single largest party in the parliament with 543 seats. As the largest party in the world, the BJP has influenced small South Asian nations toward communal politics. However, Modi's politics caused polarisation in the sub-continent as centrist space collapsed under his iron-fist rule.Polarisation helping the rightEuropean Green partiesâ electoral loss is an interesting case of why rightists have exploited the space created by global polarisation. Despite the severe climate crisis, they performed poorly in the European parliamentary electionsâall because of their ideological shortcomings. They must confront the widespread problems in Europe, i.e. income stagnation, class hierarchy, immigration crisis and war. Moreover, they cannot indulge in irrational politics by exploiting frustration and anger against the current global system. They cannot act irresponsibly, inhumanly and extra-judicially. They need to bring about ideological clarity or reason to create unity among the left-leaning mass, which is disgruntled by global capitalism. Unfortunately, they have failed to do so. Voters consider their so-called âgreen agendaâ myopic, capitalist and insufficient as they failed to address serious issues. They could not offer any solutions for the migration crisis or the Ukraine war. They have offered no permanent solutions for the climate crisis and class discrimination, making them irrelevant in the eyes of voters. American and Indian left-leaning political parties have also faced the same problem. Left-leaning political parties fail to understand that global polarisation is the result of the crisis of capitalism. Their job to critique it is no longer a need but an option. European Green partiesâ agendas, like electric vehicles against fossil fuel use to deal with the climate crisis, are ridiculously insufficient. They need to develop a systemic alternative where poor, wealthy, migrants, native, new and old generations all can find their space. For that, they need to offer an alternative way of life. Without this, their divide will remain intact, and rightist parties will hijack the space.Â  ","summary":"Polarisation has become a widespread phenomenon in the last decade. The electoral victories of Narendra Modi in 2014, Donald Trump in 2016, Jair Bolsonaro in 2019 and the gradually emboldened far-right in Europe clearly suggest a crisis in liberal democracy. This phenomenon permeates global politics, threatening the current world order in the form of tumults, wars, recessions and a multitude of other crises. However, the interesting question is why polarisation benefits only rightists and not others.The United States will elect a new president by the end of this year. However, candidates from both the Democratic and Republican parties are old figures, and there is no excitement or expectation from them. Biden, 82, wants to retain the White House; Trump, 79, hopes to return. Since their policies have dominated US politics for the last decade, it is almost certain what Biden and Trump will do if either of them is reelected. Biden will continue his conventional and centrist policies, and Trump will bring rightist and fascist policies into the mainstream. The significant difference between them is that Trump is a more unpredictable and polarising figure than Biden.There are four major polarising agendas in US politics that benefit Trump. First, Americans have been deeply divided into Pro-Roe v. Wade and anti-Roe camps. Ostensibly, this issue is not that serious since it is merely about abortion rights. Still, its interpretation and implications take it into the core of the left and right political ideologies. Religion/Bible, ethics and individual rights have come to the centre of this debate.Second, US politics has been deeply polarised amid the unprecedented migration crisis.

The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oliâs motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balenâa lone man with no political experience and political followingâdoing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oliâs party and Balenâs aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not âmend his waysâ.Balenâs attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by âpoor squatters.â Some âsquattersâ are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, âUMLsâ vote bankâ, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, âDharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?â The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oliâs pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a âstop workâ order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oliâs apparatchiks compared Balen to âa puppyâ (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning âour respected Chairmanâ. Oli himself has described Balen as a âbubbleâ which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime tradeâthe latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. âIf we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,â an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balenâs leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balenâs public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like âburning Singha Durbarâ, Nepalâs central secretariat, the office of Nepalâs Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the âGiri Bandhu Tea Estateâ scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him.

Khanal and the RSP are clearly fishing for a legal loophole to absolve the party chair and current deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane of the crime of routing money from various cooperatives into the Gorkha Media Network.

The victim was staying in a chhau goth, or menstrual shed, at her maternal uncleâs home when she was violated by her distant relative. After years of awareness campaigns and the breaking of chhau sheds by central and local governments as well as non-governmental agencies, the victimisation of women remains a daily occurrence in several parts of Nepal, especially Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005; in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But the inhumane practice remains deeply rooted in parts of Nepali society. While reports of extreme cases come from the hinterlands, menstrual taboo rules the roost even in the sophisticated drawing rooms and kitchens of urban centres. Impurity runs in the psyche of the average Nepali; menstrual blood simply oils the juggernaut of superstition, patriarchy and misogyny that is Nepali society.As disturbing as the news of the rape is the report that the victimâs relatives tried to conceal the incident. After all, this is a society whose so-called honour lies in the private parts of a woman. If it cannot save the woman from predators, it must hide the fact that it could not save the woman. From celebrating and defending rape-accused celebrities to punishing victims for speaking up, this society fails women each day. Just consider how unsafe this place is for women who have to suffer the indignity of chhau in this day and age. Cold, rain, wild animals, serpents or asphyxiation do not even come close to the danger they face from men. The tragic irony is that the woman who becomes âimpureâ or âuntouchableâ inside the home remains an object of desire inside the chhau shed. Consider how many cases of sexual assaults might have been brushed under the carpet in the name of family honour. Every night a woman has to spend in a chhau shed should count as the death of the conscience of Nepali society.Gauri Kumari Bayak and Amba Bohara and her two children were killed in 2018; Parbati Bogati and Parbati Budha were killed in 2019 in menstrual huts; and the list goes on, the tragedies returning each year. How many women must be raped and murdered before the society goes beyond the âshameâ and âhonourâ dichotomy and considers women equal humans? How many seminars, constitutions and movements does it take for the state to be able to create a safe space for women? The society and the state must answer. Until it can guarantee safety and dignity to the women, the Nepali state might want to keep the national flag half-mast. After all, one-half of the flag belongs to the women, who make up half of the country's population.Â  ","summary":"In yet another instance of the Nepali society failing to provide a safe space to women, a 16-year girl was raped in Panchadewal Binayak Municipality in Achham on Monday.

The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005; in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But the inhumane practice remains deeply rooted in parts of Nepali society. While reports of extreme cases come from the hinterlands, menstrual taboo rules the roost even in the sophisticated drawing rooms and kitchens of urban centres. Impurity runs in the psyche of the average Nepali; menstrual blood simply oils the juggernaut of superstition, patriarchy and misogyny that is Nepali society.As disturbing as the news of the rape is the report that the victimâs relatives tried to conceal the incident. After all, this is a society whose so-called honour lies in the private parts of a woman. If it cannot save the woman from predators, it must hide the fact that it could not save the woman. From celebrating and defending rape-accused celebrities to punishing victims for speaking up, this society fails women each day. Just consider how unsafe this place is for women who have to suffer the indignity of chhau in this day and age. Cold, rain, wild animals, serpents or asphyxiation do not even come close to the danger they face from men. The tragic irony is that the woman who becomes âimpureâ or âuntouchableâ inside the home remains an object of desire inside the chhau shed. Consider how many cases of sexual assaults might have been brushed under the carpet in the name of family honour. Every night a woman has to spend in a chhau shed should count as the death of the conscience of Nepali society.Gauri Kumari Bayak and Amba Bohara and her two children were killed in 2018; Parbati Bogati and Parbati Budha were killed in 2019 in menstrual huts; and the list goes on, the tragedies returning each year. How many women must be raped and murdered before the society goes beyond the âshameâ and âhonourâ dichotomy and considers women equal humans? How many seminars, constitutions and movements does it take for the state to be able to create a safe space for women? The society and the state must answer. Until it can guarantee safety and dignity to the women, the Nepali state might want to keep the national flag half-mast. After all, one-half of the flag belongs to the women, who make up half of the country's population.Â  "},{"hash":"8df5f4b08d00b35543ede4561dae2ff84147dafa21b4fe0b007e5aa821d9f461","title":"rising-stars","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/19/rising-stars","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/thumb9-1718813375.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718755200000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"The Nepali cricket team is returning home today after a bittersweet performance at the ICC Menâs T20 World Cup 2024 in the US and the West Indies.

What are the takeaways of the prime ministerâs Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The governmentâs decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The countryâs foreign policy doesnât change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the governmentâs priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesnât it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldnât affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the countryâs ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the personâs affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesnât seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime ministerâs New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime ministerâs visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime ministerâs visit doesnât reflect any misgivings about the governmentâs decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesnât reflect that. Why arenât we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministryâthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our countryâs views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we donât see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomatsâ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals donât get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful countryâs influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Letâs move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahalâs recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime ministerâs level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime ministerâs emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahalâs official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime ministerâs Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Personsâ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the reportâs submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. Indiaâs facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbourâs support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use Indiaâs infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepalâs electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We havenât developed the capacity to build big projects, and we donât envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasnât the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspectsâdomestic as well as international useâof the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.Itâs been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why havenât we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon.

I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Personsâ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the reportâs submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. Indiaâs facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbourâs support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use Indiaâs infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepalâs electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We havenât developed the capacity to build big projects, and we donât envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasnât the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspectsâdomestic as well as international useâof the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.Itâs been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why havenât we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon.

In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Letâs begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship cardâto open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cardsâone is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the personâs activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categoriesâdemographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric dataâfingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single cardâNational ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, âno, I have a National ID cardâ. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says donât ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies donât accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didnât help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepalâs total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people donât need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isnât misused and it doesnât make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you donât need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it canât be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has âterrorised peopleâ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the driveâs completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 havenât contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilitiesâ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesnât need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectorsâbanking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I donât register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies.

Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the partyâs central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices arenât in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldnât have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties arenât ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmanduâs nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centreâs support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldnât they learn from the five-year experience?Nepalâs leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesnât accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that âprotecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priorityâ. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldnât forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we canât regress to the monarchical system. We canât renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We canât backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we canât destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units canât do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, âthe bad workman blames his toolsâ, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning peopleâs trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldnât political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning peopleâs trust? They arenât training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isnât it our [leadersâ] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, wonât the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the partyâs central committee âandâ the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the âandâ provision had been changed to âorâ. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country canât sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficultiesâno matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We canât regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts donât substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we donât need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people donât discuss that. They only blame provinces. ","summary":"Prithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver.

The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhaneâs name while defining the committeeâs jurisdiction. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the peopleâs hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our partyâs exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasnât under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldnât investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committeeâs ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committeeâs jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common peopleâs money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositorsâ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Networkâwhere Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperativesâ moneyâand ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But wonât keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToRâs Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that âresponsible officials of the companyâ involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committeeâs jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhaneâs resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home ministerâs resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the ministerâs resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Letâs see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. Thatâs not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliamentâs rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didnât give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didnât the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldnât be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialistsâsuch as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialistsâif they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP canât defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isnât like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. Itâs not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congressâ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing oppositionâs House obstruction?We werenât worried about that. In fact, the prime ministerâs initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.

Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But wonât keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToRâs Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that âresponsible officials of the companyâ involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committeeâs jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhaneâs resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home ministerâs resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the ministerâs resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Letâs see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. Thatâs not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliamentâs rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didnât give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didnât the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldnât be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialistsâsuch as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialistsâif they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP canât defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isnât like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. Itâs not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congressâ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing oppositionâs House obstruction?We werenât worried about that. In fact, the prime ministerâs initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.

During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. Itâs a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on womenâs rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasnât been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesnât stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Unionâs footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepalâs transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasnât progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. Thatâs the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutorsâ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They donât want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They havenât acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committedâtorture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldnât undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the governmentâs relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.Â  ","summary":"Amnesty Internationalâs Secretary General AgnÃ¨s Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour.
