In his speech, he later said that the government has given priority to promoting the private sector's ‘Make In Nepal’ initiative. The annual financial plan focused on agriculture growth, exports, and energy generation, while introducing measures to address the problems faced by credit cooperatives, is worth Rs1.86 trillion for the next fiscal year beginning mid-July.The budget size is 6.2 percent larger than the unrevised budget of the current fiscal year.With this expenditure, the government has targeted an economic growth rate of 6 percent for the next fiscal year and aims to cap inflation at 5.5 percent.Some economists say pumping Rs1.86 trillion into the economy to achieve 6 percent growth and capping inflation at 5.5 percent appear to be contradictory steps. Economists say wise money supply is vital. If the money supply grows at a faster rate than the economy’s ability to produce goods and services, inflation will also pick up, which is likely in the next fiscal year.In the ongoing fiscal year, the money supply in the economy has not grown fast enough, leading to decreases in production, which in turn contributed to a rise in unemployment.The government has allocated Rs1.14 trillion, or 61.31 percent of the total budget, for recurrent spending, which consists of regular expenses such as salaries and allowances. It has set aside Rs352 billion, or 18.94 percent of the budget, for capital spending, which is used to build projects and critical infrastructure.Similarly, the government has earmarked Rs367 billion, or 19.74 percent of the total budget, for financing.According to Pun, the government will raise Rs1.26 trillion in revenue, Rs52.33 billion in foreign grants, Rs217.67 billion in external loans and Rs330 billion in internal loans. Growth is slowing this year, which has divided economists and worried politicians. Thus, the budget offers even more hope than at other times. “Overall, the budget is good. It covers almost all sectors,” said Rameshore Khanal, former finance secretary. “The industrial corridor launched by the government will help address the ongoing economic crisis by boosting industrial output.” Economist Govinda Nepal said that, unlike the government’s policies and programmes, the budget is more balanced. “But it has not given a clear view of how the cooperatives crisis will be settled. Similarly, the government lacks a vision to operate the new airports in Pokhara and Bhairahawa.”He said that the budget has lofty goals, which are difficult to achieve given the uncertain political climate. The government has raised the capital expenditure by Rs50 billion for the next fiscal year.“For a long time, we have been unable to spend the capital budget wisely. We hope that an increase in capital expenditure will boost the economy. This is the beginning of the economic reform,” Pun told Parliament while presenting the budget. He said the budget for the next fiscal year 2024-25 has focused on reform in three key areas.First, boosting the slow economic growth; second, increasing the declining private sector investment and confidence; and third, improving the distressed agricultural productivity.The government has announced the signing of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement with other countries to attract foreign direct investment.“Nepal has seen low public and private investment, which has slowed the growth rate and put the country into a low-growth trap,” said Pun.He said the budget has focused on Nepal’s graduation from the ranks of the least developed countries, meeting the Sustainable Development Goals target by 2030, and becoming a middle-income country by 2030.Pun said the other area of focus is employment generation by boosting private sector morale to invest, and implementing skills-based learning.The government has announced an investment decade in the agriculture sector in order to modernise it. In the next fiscal year, Rs57.29 billion is allocated for the sector.The government has announced interest subsidies, technical support, and tax waivers on machinery imports for individuals or firms engaged in commercial farming and livestock production through contract farming on 10 bigha (6.77 hectares) in Tarai and 50 ropani (2.54 hectares] in the hills.There are new provisions for insurance premium waivers and soft loans for seven individuals and firms producing aromatic rice as part of a pilot project on more than 100 bigha of land. They will also have easy access to chemical fertiliser, seeds, and technical support.The government may launch commercial farming of wild animals like musk deer in mountain districts like Myagdi, Mustang, Manang, Gorkha, and Dhading.Economist Pushkar Bajracharya said that the budget seemed focused on promoting innovation with the announcement of the agriculture investment decade, the science and technology decade, and the women's empowerment decade, which are the bases for economic transformation.“But it’s difficult to achieve the economic growth rate as we are in a crisis, and there was no concrete initiative to bail the country out of economic slowdown.”Finance Minister Pun said that the country will see a revolution in energy production.He said that the government hopes to add 900MW into the national grid by the next fiscal year and take the total generation to 4,500MW in the next fiscal year. It plans to increase per capita electricity usage to 450 units.Pun said that to meet the dry season demand, construction of four reservoir-based projects—1,200MW Budhi Gandaki, 670MW Dudh Koshi, 417MW Nalgadh, and 280MW Naumure—will begin in the next fiscal year.He announced that the government would start the construction of the 783MW Sunkoshi III hydropower project.The government aims to connect 100MW of solar projects from the private sector to the national grid.The government has made orientation training free of charge for people going abroad for work. Similarly, it plans to launch a 'returnee entrepreneurship programme' for migrant workers who have returned from foreign employment. Under the scheme, at least 100,000 people will be self-employed.The finance minister said a necessary budget has been allocated to establish consumer courts. In February 2022, the Supreme Court directed that such courts be established in all provinces.“Activities like black-marketing and syndicating in the market will be controlled. Consumer courts will also be formed. I have allocated a budget for the purpose,” said Pun.The government said it would provide loans for technical education, including medical education. “Law will be amended to provide loans and concessions loans for technical education in high demand.”Pun also said that the government aims to welcome 1.6 million foreign tourists in the next fiscal year.The finance minister also announced plans to promote Nepal as a wedding destination among foreign tourists in a bid to promote cultural and tourist destinations.The government will lease government lands to the private sector for hotel and resort construction in order to boost tourist numbers.The government has a target of exporting information technology-related goods and services worth Rs3 trillion in the next ten years.Pun has said that 500,000 direct and 1 million indirect jobs will be created in the IT sector.“Nepal will be developed as an information technology hub,” he said. “Artificial intelligence will be developed, promoted and regulated,” he said.The government has constituted a fund of Rs1 billion to address the financial needs of startups. The government will also pass necessary laws to brand, market, and sell local alcohol.A sum of Rs21.60 billion has been set aside for the reconstruction of earthquake-affected Jajarkot and Rukum West. The two districts were badly hit by an earthquake in November, 2023.Chandra Prasad Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Nepal’s apex private sector body, said that the budget has addressed almost all of the suggestions given by the private sector.“We had demanded the formation of a high-level reform commission to address the ongoing economic crisis, and the budget has addressed it. \"Similarly, the private sector had been pushing for contract farming, which the budget addresses as well.\"The budget has prioritised startups, promotion of Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) tourism, and hill stations. \"If the budget is implemented properly, the 6 percent economic growth target is achievable,\" Dhakal said.  ","summary":"Following an agreement to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Tuesday presented the country’s annual financial plan in Parliament without any roadblocks from the opposition Nepali Congress.The budget speech, which lasted less than two hours, received applause from the lawmakers in the joint parliament session on several occasions—particularly when Pun announced the removal of VAT imposed on vegetables and fruits, and the return of at least Rs500,000 of each cooperatives depositor by recovering them from the properties of the directors.Unlike in past years, Pun was seen carrying a bag made of local materials instead of a red or black briefcase.

Likewise, Badri Pandey and Ishwari Neupane of the Nepali Congress, Lekhntah Dahal from the Maoist Centre, Shishir Khanal of the RSP, and Dhurbha Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party are other members of the parliamentary probe committee. The tenure of the special probe committee will be three months from the start of its work. The term will be extended if the panel is unable to complete the work in that time.Earlier, the four-member task force led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri agreed on a four-point ToR for the probe committee. The task force members handed over the ToR document to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. With this, the nearly two-months- long parliamentary impasse ended on Tuesday, allowing the government to present the government’s annual budget. In the afternoon, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun presented the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 at the joint session of Parliament.As per the agreement, the panel will conduct investigation and make recommendations on the resolving legal and institutional issues faced by cooperatives and on regulations, institutional purpose, supervision and transparency of their financial systems.Despite the demand of the Congress, the name of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who has been accused of illegally obtaining loans from three cooperatives based in Butwal, Chitwan, and Pokhara, has not been mentioned in the ToR of the parliamentary committee.

The parliamentary panel has also been mandated to study and analyse the progress of the savings protection and return process on those crisis-ridden cooperatives identified in annex 1 and annex 2 of the ToR.The Department of Cooperatives has listed 20 cooperatives as crisis-ridden, with billions of rupees of depositors at risk. The fourth clause on the jurisdiction of the committee states that it will track the condition of funds from crisis-ridden cooperatives, including those allegedly transferred to the Gorkha Media Network and other companies and organisations. It will also look into the legality of such transfers, investigate anyone involved in illegal transfer of funds, and make recommendations to recover the funds. As per police investigation, billions of rupees from several cooperatives were transferred to GB Rai’s Gorkha Media Network. He has fled the country and Interpol has issued a red notice against him.

The Indian economy has grown steadily over the past many years but has failed to add quality employment in line with its growing youth population. Poor quality of technical education is often blamed for the unemployability of young graduates. Yet this misses the fact that if there is substantial availability of well-paid jobs in any sector, skill development follows, as has happened in the IT sector. Formal unemployment figures are not a reliable way to understand the amplitude of the problem as they do not record many seekers who are not actively seeking work in lower-paid professions or in family businesses.

The number of Indians going abroad for studies or jobs has assumed significant proportions in recent years, pointing to dissatisfaction with the opportunities at hand. Hundreds of technical colleges have shut down in the past decade because their graduates could not find appropriate job opportunities. Government responseThe Narendra Modi government has tried various strategies to revitalise the job sector over the years. When Modi entered office in 2014, he promised to create 20 million jobs. Part of his strategy was to revitalise the Indian manufacturing sector. He launched an ambitious programme named “Make in India” aimed at creating 100 million additional manufacturing jobs by 2022. Businesses were encouraged to reduce imports of manufactured goods and offered incentives to produce within the country. India was expected to rival China for its manufacturing capabilities. Ten years later, the results are mixed.While imports of items such as mobile phones and toys declined and a few big names, such as Apple, started manufacturing in the country, India has yet to become the manufacturing giant as was hoped for. Most manufacturing units in the country remain small-scale, employing less than 50 people and there are fewer people employed in the manufacturing sector than was the case 10 years back. Tellingly PM Modi has not invoked the ‘Make in India’ program in his campaigning.Moreover, a blue-collar manufacturing job may not be the path to prosperity, as was the case in China. There is a distinct trend of contractual employment where even large Indian manufacturers outsource operations or hire temporary staff. These are typically paid less than permanent employees, do not get health or retirement benefits, and remain outside the ambit of labour laws. The government itself makes extensive use of the contractual workforce.Back-office of the worldFor long, the Information Technology (IT) services sector compensated for the lack of vibrant manufacturing. Thousands of young graduates find work each year in local and multinational companies. Current estimates for the number of people employed by the IT services sector stand at over 5 million. Not only was the IT sector relatively immune from cost competition, unlike manufacturing, but it also paid well.However, employment in any one sector cannot grow indefinitely. Traditionally, the big IT companies hired fresh graduates in the thousands from college campuses nationwide. While the best campuses still attract recruiters, the numbers have decreased drastically recently. The industry body NASSCOM reported that aggregate employment in the Indian IT sector dropped for the first time in 20 years. Many of the top Indian IT companies have shrunk their workforce. It needs to be clarified if this is a temporary slowdown after the COVID-era boom in hiring or a more permanent status quo.Even if it is a temporary downturn tied to global events, there is a new disruptor in Artificial Intelligence, a double-edged sword for the Indian IT industry. While India leads in the number of available AI talent, there are apprehensions that advances in AI will make many traditional IT and back-office roles redundant. It is hard to predict whether the number of jobs that AI replaces turns out to be significantly higher than the ones it creates.A daunting challengeThe new Indian government, which will form once the results are declared on June 4 will have to contend with this difficult problem. It is easy for the opposition to promise to fill 3 million government jobs, but the fact is that government employment has been declining over the past many years. Employment in manufacturing is unlikely to go up significantly from current levels. Over-reliance on the IT sector must also prove problematic sooner or later.Economists often talk about a ‘demographic dividend’ for countries with a large youth population, such as India.

The FY 2023-24 budget was Rs1,751 billion, but mid-year adjustments reduced it to Rs1,530 billion. As of Tuesday, only Rs1,116 billion (63.72 percent) had been spent, with just a month and a half remaining of the current fiscal year. This raises concerns about meeting expenditure expectations and the rationale behind such a large budget.The National Planning Commission's resource committee had set a budget ceiling of Rs1,800 billion, but the government did not consider revenue trends, expenditure capacity or the commission's suggestions. The finance minister has projected Rs1,260 billion in tax revenue for FY 2024-25. For FY 2023-24, the expected tax revenue was Rs1305 billion, but only Rs777 billion (60 percent) had been collected as of Tuesday. Given this, the projected tax revenue is unlikely to be met, indicating that the budget size is not appropriate or based on sufficient evidence.Regarding federalism in Nepal, functional responsibilities are constitutionally devolved, while revenue remains centralised. There is a provision to balance this fiscal gap through fiscal transfers. However, the current budget is not favourable to provincial and local levels, as it does not reflect their actual budgetary needs. The total size of fiscal transfers, including revenue sharing to the sub-federal level, has decreased from Rs574 billion in FY 2023-24 to Rs567 billion in FY 2024-25. This is unfortunate in terms of the budget ratio; it was 33 percent in FY 2023-24 and dropped to 30 percent in FY 2024-25.Federalism sidelinedPost-federalism budgets in Nepal have hardly done justice to the sub-federal levels. According to the principle of fiscal transfers, the fiscal equalisation grant should increase proportionally to the budget size. However, its ratio is declining every year. For example, in FY 2018-19, the share of the fiscal equalisation grant to the budget for the sub-federal level was about 10.5 percent, which declined to 8.3 percent in FY 2023-24. In the latest budget, it further declined to 7.9 percent.The ratio of conditional grants comprises the lion's share of overall grant distribution. In FY 2023-24, out of the total grant distribution, the share of conditional grants to the local levels was 65 percent. This ratio increased to 67 percent in the FY 2024-25 budget. This is distressing for the local level.Even within the jurisdiction outlined by the constitution, the tasks handled by various ministries during the pre-federalisation period should gradually be relinquished and delegated to sub-federal levels. However, judging by the trend of conditional grants, this transition does not seem to be occurring. While some institutional structures have been left intact, there is a concerning trend of authority consolidating under the guise of conditional grants. Federal ministries are establishing numerous sub-federal level project offices, ostensibly under the pretext of conditional grants. Looking at yesterday's budget, it seems that most of the sectoral ministries are gradually eroding the authority of the sub-federal levels in the name of various projects.Sub-federal levels lack autonomy on conditional grants. Projects and programmes must be implemented according to the conditions and standards set by the federal government. Conditional grants should empower sub-federal levels to execute programs and projects in alignment with national policies. However, the definition of a conditional grant outlined in the law has been ignored. Conditional grants are being distributed without consideration for the criteria set by law, instructions from parliamentary committees, and decisions of the fiscal commission.Although Prime Minister Dahal promised not to reduce equalisation grants for sub-federal levels, he has failed to follow through. A few weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance sent a letter reducing the equalisation grants allocated to the local level by 26 percent, amounting to Rs24 billion. The same situation applies to the provinces. The Office of the Auditor General's 61st report, released just two days ago, also stated that not only the fiscal equalisation grant but all grants, including revenue sharing, have been reduced towards the end of the fiscal year. For example, matching and special grants to the sub-federal levels were decreased by 25 percent in FY 2022-23. The revenue-sharing figure declined by 21.4 percent.The ratio of the fiscal equalisation grant to the total budget for sub-federal levels was 8.34 percent in FY 2023-24, which declined to 7.96 percent in yesterday's budget. In FY 2018-19, it was 10.27 percent. This is really unfortunate for the sub-federal levels.Regarding the government policy and programmes, President Ramchandra Paudel spoke for about two hours, emphasising the implementation of the constitution and the strengthening of federalism, among other priorities. However, an important issue, the adjustment of the police security force at the provincial level, which is crucial for the strengthening of federalism, is not included in the policy and program. It was not included in the FY 2023-24 policy and program either.Point 396 of the FY 2023-24 budget speech stated that the police security force would be adjusted in the provinces. Despite this mention, the issue of police adjustment in the provinces has not been addressed yet. This year, the problem is neither included in the policy and program nor the budget speech. Last year, although the police adjustment policy was included in the budget speech, the budget wasn’t allocated for it in the Ministry of Home Affairs' budget line item. This year, it is excluded from the policy, programme, and budget speech. Consequently, it is also not included in the budget line item of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Out of this ministry's total budget of Rs1.99 billion, 99.8 percent is allocated to the federal level. Once again, the government has bypassed the provinces.Lopsided prioritiesOne of the government's stated priorities is strengthening federalism, but the policies and programmes don’t reflect this. The budget's five priorities include economic reform, promotion of the private sector, agriculture, energy, information technology, tourism, industrial development, and infrastructure construction. However, strengthening federalism is not mentioned among the budget priorities.The biggest problem in the FY 2023-24 budget was that the budget limits for the federal ministries' programs and projects were minimal. For example, in the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, there were 2,829 projects, with 66 percent of them being up to Rs5 million. In the Ministry of Urban Development, the Ministry of Water Supply, and the Ministry of Youth, the percentages of projects up to Rs5 million were 98 percent, 84 percent, and 99 percent, respectively.Most federal ministries, including these, had not embraced the spirit of the constitution. They had violated not only the constitution but also the 'Government of Nepal (Allocation of Business) Rules, 2017'. According to these rules, the role of most federal ministries is to formulate and regulate policies, laws, and standards. However, these ministries were found to have gone beyond their role and scope. The role of federal ministries and agencies in selecting and implementing projects is to focus on national pride, game-changing, and other strategic projects. Instead, most of the ministries allocated their budget for small projects.After widespread criticism, the federal government decided not to operate projects smaller than Rs30 million. For a thorough analysis, the details of the allocations of the sectoral ministries are needed, as they cannot be estimated based on the budget speech text alone. However, there is a risk that the federal government will forward all the small-scale programs and projects to the local level. More and more small-scale programs and projects are being sent to the local level, but staffing issues remain unresolved. Even now, staffing at the local level is a significant problem.A quick review of the ministries' allocation budgets reveals that most ministries have centralised all resources. For example, the total budget of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, amounting to Rs0.50 billion for FY 2024-25, is kept at the central level, with not a single pie allocated to the sub-federal level from this ministry.Finally, this budget does not support federalism or favour provincial and local levels. Fiscal transfers and equalisation grants have decreased, centralising resources and undermining sub-federal autonomy. Despite government priorities, the budget fails to reflect a commitment to strengthening federalism. ","summary":"Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Tuesday presented a budget of Rs1,860 billion for Fiscal Year 2024-25, a 6.2 percent increase from FY 2023-24. The FY 2023-24 budget was Rs1,751 billion, but mid-year adjustments reduced it to Rs1,530 billion. As of Tuesday, only Rs1,116 billion (63.72 percent) had been spent, with just a month and a half remaining of the current fiscal year. This raises concerns about meeting expenditure expectations and the rationale behind such a large budget.The National Planning Commission's resource committee had set a budget ceiling of Rs1,800 billion, but the government did not consider revenue trends, expenditure capacity or the commission's suggestions. The finance minister has projected Rs1,260 billion in tax revenue for FY 2024-25. For FY 2023-24, the expected tax revenue was Rs1305 billion, but only Rs777 billion (60 percent) had been collected as of Tuesday. Given this, the projected tax revenue is unlikely to be met, indicating that the budget size is not appropriate or based on sufficient evidence.Regarding federalism in Nepal, functional responsibilities are constitutionally devolved, while revenue remains centralised. There is a provision to balance this fiscal gap through fiscal transfers. However, the current budget is not favourable to provincial and local levels, as it does not reflect their actual budgetary needs. The total size of fiscal transfers, including revenue sharing to the sub-federal level, has decreased from Rs574 billion in FY 2023-24 to Rs567 billion in FY 2024-25. This is unfortunate in terms of the budget ratio; it was 33 percent in FY 2023-24 and dropped to 30 percent in FY 2024-25.Federalism sidelinedPost-federalism budgets in Nepal have hardly done justice to the sub-federal levels. According to the principle of fiscal transfers, the fiscal equalisation grant should increase proportionally to the budget size. However, its ratio is declining every year. For example, in FY 2018-19, the share of the fiscal equalisation grant to the budget for the sub-federal level was about 10.5 percent, which declined to 8.3 percent in FY 2023-24. In the latest budget, it further declined to 7.9 percent.The ratio of conditional grants comprises the lion's share of overall grant distribution. In FY 2023-24, out of the total grant distribution, the share of conditional grants to the local levels was 65 percent. This ratio increased to 67 percent in the FY 2024-25 budget. This is distressing for the local level.Even within the jurisdiction outlined by the constitution, the tasks handled by various ministries during the pre-federalisation period should gradually be relinquished and delegated to sub-federal levels. However, judging by the trend of conditional grants, this transition does not seem to be occurring. While some institutional structures have been left intact, there is a concerning trend of authority consolidating under the guise of conditional grants. Federal ministries are establishing numerous sub-federal level project offices, ostensibly under the pretext of conditional grants. Looking at yesterday's budget, it seems that most of the sectoral ministries are gradually eroding the authority of the sub-federal levels in the name of various projects.Sub-federal levels lack autonomy on conditional grants. Projects and programmes must be implemented according to the conditions and standards set by the federal government. Conditional grants should empower sub-federal levels to execute programs and projects in alignment with national policies. However, the definition of a conditional grant outlined in the law has been ignored. Conditional grants are being distributed without consideration for the criteria set by law, instructions from parliamentary committees, and decisions of the fiscal commission.Although Prime Minister Dahal promised not to reduce equalisation grants for sub-federal levels, he has failed to follow through. A few weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance sent a letter reducing the equalisation grants allocated to the local level by 26 percent, amounting to Rs24 billion. The same situation applies to the provinces. The Office of the Auditor General's 61st report, released just two days ago, also stated that not only the fiscal equalisation grant but all grants, including revenue sharing, have been reduced towards the end of the fiscal year. For example, matching and special grants to the sub-federal levels were decreased by 25 percent in FY 2022-23. The revenue-sharing figure declined by 21.4 percent.The ratio of the fiscal equalisation grant to the total budget for sub-federal levels was 8.34 percent in FY 2023-24, which declined to 7.96 percent in yesterday's budget. In FY 2018-19, it was 10.27 percent. This is really unfortunate for the sub-federal levels.Regarding the government policy and programmes, President Ramchandra Paudel spoke for about two hours, emphasising the implementation of the constitution and the strengthening of federalism, among other priorities. However, an important issue, the adjustment of the police security force at the provincial level, which is crucial for the strengthening of federalism, is not included in the policy and program. It was not included in the FY 2023-24 policy and program either.Point 396 of the FY 2023-24 budget speech stated that the police security force would be adjusted in the provinces. Despite this mention, the issue of police adjustment in the provinces has not been addressed yet. This year, the problem is neither included in the policy and program nor the budget speech. Last year, although the police adjustment policy was included in the budget speech, the budget wasn’t allocated for it in the Ministry of Home Affairs' budget line item. This year, it is excluded from the policy, programme, and budget speech. Consequently, it is also not included in the budget line item of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Out of this ministry's total budget of Rs1.99 billion, 99.8 percent is allocated to the federal level.

This year, as in the past, algae and other harmful particles are being discovered in bottled water. In March, water samples from the source, community schools and taps of seven wards of Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur were found contaminated with faecal coliform and microorganisms found in faeces. Despite being a country rich in water resources, the government and authorities have failed to deliver safe water to the citizens, reminding us of a line by English poet Samuel Tylor Coleridge, “Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink”.With people’s health already compromised, lack of budget to test the drinkability of supplied water is alarming as it may lead to more water-borne diseases. Experts warn that contaminated water also contributes to cholera, dysentery, typhoid and hepatitis A and E. Budgetary constraints have affected health agencies primarily responsible for regular drinking water testing. For the upcoming fiscal year, the government has set aside Rs86.24 billion for the health sector, a 2.5 percent increase from the Rs83.99 billion this year. However, the sector’s total share in the budget is only 4.6 percent, leaving us wondering if the amount will cover issues like water safety programmes. The government’s efforts to supply safe water from public networks have been highly unsatisfactory. The Melamchi Drinking Water Project’s inconsistent distribution has disappointed people, and the leaks in the project’s pipes have only resulted in further contamination. Given this, jarred and bottled water are widely used in schools, offices, households and public spaces. However, most of these water sources remain unchecked due to the country’s poor monitoring facilities and human resources. As responsible for unsafe water is the general public, having polluted water sources with faeces, sewage, harmful chemicals, pollutants and other wastes. Additionally, frequent floods and unprecedented rainfalls resulting from climate change contaminate water with pathogens, as shown by a technical paper, “Climate Change and Water”, of the International Panel on Climate Change. Yet, our policies often overlook human-induced water safety concerns. Water contamination usually makes headlines before and during the monsoon, leaving us unaware of their status in other seasons. The government should immediately allocate more inspectors to test water sources and develop plans at local levels for year-round monitoring. Once the water jars and bottles are found unsuitable for drinking, they are sent back to their respective companies, but there’s no guarantee that these companies will later ensure water safety. Sensitising water suppliers on the public’s health and training them to follow the National Drinking Water Quality Standard, which includes water sampling and testing and physic-chemical and microbiological testing, is of paramount importance. The standard also mandates the suppliers conduct quality monitoring, which should be diligently followed. Safe drinking water is a fundamental right; the authorities are duty-bound to fulfil that. This, however, doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do anything at our end to protect our own health. According to the World Health Organization, diarrhoeal cases take a toll on around half a million low- and middle-income countries, with most deaths occurring in children under five. This suggests that simple preventive measures at home can also protect us from deadly diseases. For this, the government and health authorities should make people aware of proper water treatment methods and safe storage. Only serious steps in water security will ensure the government meets its pledge to ensure safe water access for everyone by 2030.

But the new parties, where will they start?” he said after voting in Alexandra, a sprawling township east of Johannesburg.Then led by Nelson Mandela, the ANC swept to power in South Africa’s first multi-racial election in 1994 and has won a majority in national elections held every five years since then, though its share of the vote has gradually declined.If it falls short of 50% this time, the ANC will have to make a deal with one or more smaller parties to govern - uncharted and potentially choppy waters for a young democracy that has so far been dominated by a single party.Voters are electing provincial assemblies in each of the country’s nine provinces, and a new national parliament which will then choose the next president.With the ANC still on course to win the largest share of the vote, its leader President Cyril Ramaphosa is likely to remain in office.More than 27 million South Africans are registered to vote at more than 23,000 polling stations where voting will continue until 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).“If early indications are anything to go by, we may match or just surpass the 66% voter turnout (seen in the last election in 2019),” said Masego Sheburi, a senior official at the electoral commission, at a briefing about six hours into the election.Turnout has steadily fallen since the start of the democratic era and is one of the key variables this time.The election appeared to be going smoothly in most places, with Sheburi saying 93% of polling stations had opened on time.Reuters reporters witnessed isolated incidents, such as voters being turned away from a Johannesburg polling station because they were not registered to vote there, and in one Alexandra location voting was delayed for hours due to the late arrival of ballot papers.‘MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION’After voting at a polling station in Soweto, a huge township outside Johannesburg, Ramaphosa said the ANC had run a strong campaign.“I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart of hearts that the people will invest their confidence in the African National Congress,” he said.John Steenhuisen, leader of the pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA) party which won the second-largest share of the vote in the last election in 2019, urged voters to turn out in large numbers to bring change to South Africa.“This is the most consequential election since 1994,” he said after casting his ballot in Durban.Other opposition parties hoping to loosen the ANC’s grip on power include the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), founded by Julius Malema, a firebrand former leader of the ANC’s youth wing. The EFF wants to nationalise mines and banks and seize land from white farmers to address racial and economic disparities.“We see ourselves overtaking the ANC, not the DA. The DA is small boys. We have no time for small boys,” a typically combative Malema told reporters as he arrived to cast his ballot in Seshego, in the northern province of Limpopo.“We’re going for the real giant, which is the ANC. We are in an election to remove the ANC,” he said. “We are here to take over government.”Opinion polls suggest EFF support has been hovering between 10 and 12%, far short of the ANC on 37-44%, but Malema could find himself in position to be a kingmaker depending on the election results.Zuma’s new MK party looks set to eat into both ANC and EFF support, especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal where he has enduring influence despite being forced to quit as president in 2018 after a string of scandals.The election commission is expected to start releasing partial results within hours of polling stations closing and final results within three or four days at most.

But the new parties, where will they start?” he said after voting in Alexandra, a sprawling township east of Johannesburg.Then led by Nelson Mandela, the ANC swept to power in South Africa’s first multi-racial election in 1994 and has won a majority in national elections held every five years since then, though its share of the vote has gradually declined.If it falls short of 50% this time, the ANC will have to make a deal with one or more smaller parties to govern - uncharted and potentially choppy waters for a young democracy that has so far been dominated by a single party.Voters are electing provincial assemblies in each of the country’s nine provinces, and a new national parliament which will then choose the next president.With the ANC still on course to win the largest share of the vote, its leader President Cyril Ramaphosa is likely to remain in office.More than 27 million South Africans are registered to vote at more than 23,000 polling stations where voting will continue until 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).“If early indications are anything to go by, we may match or just surpass the 66% voter turnout (seen in the last election in 2019),” said Masego Sheburi, a senior official at the electoral commission, at a briefing about six hours into the election.Turnout has steadily fallen since the start of the democratic era and is one of the key variables this time.The election appeared to be going smoothly in most places, with Sheburi saying 93% of polling stations had opened on time.Reuters reporters witnessed isolated incidents, such as voters being turned away from a Johannesburg polling station because they were not registered to vote there, and in one Alexandra location voting was delayed for hours due to the late arrival of ballot papers.‘MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION’After voting at a polling station in Soweto, a huge township outside Johannesburg, Ramaphosa said the ANC had run a strong campaign.“I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart of hearts that the people will invest their confidence in the African National Congress,” he said.John Steenhuisen, leader of the pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA) party which won the second-largest share of the vote in the last election in 2019, urged voters to turn out in large numbers to bring change to South Africa.“This is the most consequential election since 1994,” he said after casting his ballot in Durban.Other opposition parties hoping to loosen the ANC’s grip on power include the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), founded by Julius Malema, a firebrand former leader of the ANC’s youth wing. The EFF wants to nationalise mines and banks and seize land from white farmers to address racial and economic disparities.“We see ourselves overtaking the ANC, not the DA. The DA is small boys. We have no time for small boys,” a typically combative Malema told reporters as he arrived to cast his ballot in Seshego, in the northern province of Limpopo.“We’re going for the real giant, which is the ANC. We are in an election to remove the ANC,” he said. “We are here to take over government.”Opinion polls suggest EFF support has been hovering between 10 and 12%, far short of the ANC on 37-44%, but Malema could find himself in position to be a kingmaker depending on the election results.Zuma’s new MK party looks set to eat into both ANC and EFF support, especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal where he has enduring influence despite being forced to quit as president in 2018 after a string of scandals.The election commission is expected to start releasing partial results within hours of polling stations closing and final results within three or four days at most.

Thaksin’s lawyer Winyat Chartmontri told Reuters that his client could not appear at Wednesday's hearing due to a Covid-19 infection.Thaksin, 74, has repeatedly pledged his loyalty to the crown, criticism of which is forbidden under Thailand’s lese-majeste law, which is one of the world’s strictest of its kind.The billionaire, who was convicted of abuse of power and conflicts of interest, was released on parole in February after six months in detention.He made a dramatic return in 2023 from 15 years of self-imposed exile, during which he remained a central figure throughout repeated bouts of political upheaval.Thaksin would be the highest-profile case among more than 270 prosecutions in recent years under the lese-majeste law, which carries a maximum jail term of 15 years for each perceived insult of the royal family.The popular opposition Move Forward Party, the biggest in parliament, has found itself in hot water over its campaign to amend the law, with the Constitutional Court due to decide whether to dissolve the party, which would see bans for its leadership.Thaksin, the founder of the populist juggernaut Pheu Thai, has seen his family’s parties win all but one election since 2001, with three Shinawatra governments toppled by coups or court rulings.His return and relatively short time in detention fuelled speculation he had struck a deal with his bitter rivals in the conservative establishment and military which he has long blamed for trying to stifle pro-Thaksin governments.

We have not seen that yet,” he said, noting that Israel's operations were mostly in a corridor on the outskirts of Rafah.Asked if he was saying the recent ground operations in Rafah would not prompt a US withdrawal of more military aid, Kirby said “I believe that’s what I’ve been saying here.”Recent deaths in Rafah have tested President Joe Biden’s promise to withhold weapons from Israel if the US ally made a major invasion of Rafah that put displaced persons there at risk.Speaking at a ceremonial event in Washington, US Vice President Kamala Harris said, “The word tragic doesn’t even begin to describe” an Israeli airstrike on Sunday that triggered a fire in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, killing 45 Palestinians.Harris’s remark, in response to a reporter’s question, also followed what Gaza health authorities described as Israeli tank shelling of a tent camp in an evacuation area west of Rafah that killed at least 21 people on Tuesday.Israel said that “something unfortunately went tragically wrong” in Sunday’s airstrike while its military denied shelling the tent camp on Tuesday. Israel said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives in Sunday’s operation and had not intended to cause civilian casualties.Hamas issued a statement celebrating the martyrdom of two fighters in the strike on Sunday, Kirby said, an indication that Israel was trying to go after Hamas in a “targeted, precise way.”“The Israelis have said they used 37-pound bombs, precision-guided munitions,” Kirby said. “If it is in fact what they used, it is certainly indicative of an effort to be discreet and targeted and precise. Now, obviously this had tragic results, and obviously that needs to be investigated.”Asked whether Israel’s strikes could put Biden in a difficult position, Kirby told reporters Tuesday that instead there was a real danger that Israel could become further isolated from the international community with the manner in which it is conducting operations. “So this is of concern, clearly, because it's not in Israel's best interest,” Kirby said. “And it’s not in our best interest for Israel to become increasingly isolated on the world stage.”The US administration’s response was criticized earlier Tuesday by human rights and Arab American groups.“Sadly, because of President Biden’s insistence on sending more bombs to enable Netanyahu’s war crimes in Rafah, this is now as much an American genocide as it is an Israeli genocide,” said Nihad Awad, executive director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations.Israeli and US officials have denounced the use of the term genocide to describe events on the ground in Gaza.The State Department said on Tuesday that as soon as it saw reports of Sunday’s Rafah incident, Washington expressed deep concern to Israel and urged an investigation, which Israel has promised.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that Washington will be closely watching Israel's probe but Israel’s military operations so far in Rafah have not been as large-scale as those in central or northern Gaza.Global leaders have expressed horror at the fire in a designated “humanitarian zone” of Rafah where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere had sought shelter.More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says.

In parliamentary tradition, after being elected, the Speaker dissociates himself or herself from the party that gave the election ticket to maintain neutrality.Speakers in Nepal, however, have often run into controversies. They have also been accused of failing to maintain neutrality while conducting parliamentary business. At times, they are accused of working at the behest of the mother party.The Speaker’s role becomes crucial in minimising inter-party rivalry that often leads to a political deadlock. Some Speakers such as Daman Nath Dhungana and Subas Nembang have successfully played that role as well.The incumbent Speaker Devraj Ghimire also faces the charge of failing to demonstrate an impartial role.On Saturday, Ghimire addressed a gathering organised by a provincial chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists where he said since Parliament had been held hostage, “some measures may need to be taken”. He went on to say that the government may be forced to introduce the fiscal budget through an ordinance should the House deadlock prolong.His controversial statement came ahead of political leaders’ consultations on the day as they tried to find a way out of the impasse. Soon afterwards, Ghimire attended a meeting convened by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief.The opposition leaders have fiercely criticised the Speaker mainly after the May 16 incident when the Congress and the UML lawmakers had a scuffle during the House meeting. A UML lawmaker, Ghimire formally disassociated himself from the party after being elected the Speaker in early 2023.Experts on parliamentary affairs say Speaker candidates must be picked carefully, analysing if they can do justice to the top position of the legislature. When the Speakers are selected on the basis of their relations with party leaders, they often take decisions to suit the leaders they are grateful to.Speaker is a crucial constitutional position, former Speaker Daman Nath Dhungana told the Post. But political parties often give the post to someone from the party so as to satisfy their aspirations.On May 15, UML chair Oli hinted that as Congress lawmakers had continuously been barring Home Minister Lamichhane from speaking in the House, the situation would be changed. Congress, the main opposition party, has been disrupting the House proceedings, demanding a parliamentary inquiry against Lamichhane in his alleged connections with cooperative funds embezzlement. \"It is unacceptable to us that only the Congress speaks in the meeting. Congress is not the only party in Parliament,” Oli said at the UML parliamentary party meeting on May 15. “Home Minister Lamichhane will speak at the parliament meeting tomorrow; if not, our party will speak.”The next day, Speaker Ghimire allowed Home Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and make his statement while Congress lawmakers were already chanting slogans. Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML. Speaker Sapkota had allowed Sharma to table the bill amid obstruction from the UML.The UML also accused Speaker Sapkota of aiding the party’s split. The UML at the time had urged the Speaker to sack 14 UML lawmakers, who defected to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) under Madhav Kumar Nepal. However, the Speaker refused to formalise the UML’s decision. The UML persistently protested in Parliament demanding Sapkota’s resignation as Speaker.In January 2019, Speaker Mahara was accused of siding with the ruling party during the passage of the National Medical Education Bill, even though the Congress had contested some of the bill's clauses. Additionally, he came under fire for not allowing Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to voice his opinion in the House before inviting then-prime minister Oli to speak on the contentious Guthi Bill. Ramchandra Paudel, a former Congress leader who became the Speaker after the 1996 midterm election, even faced impeachment for his role in Parliament. An impeachment motion was registered against him on September 23, 1998, for aiding the passage of a bill amid obstructions from the main opposition UML.In principle, the Speaker shouldn’t carry forward the House business even if a single parliamentarian raises his hand, says Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who has followed Parliament for more than two decades.The Speaker has the right to marshal security personnel against a parliamentarian if they disrupt the House proceedings, but s/he cannot carry forward the House business when there is an obstruction, Thapa told the Post.

Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML. Speaker Sapkota had allowed Sharma to table the bill amid obstruction from the UML.The UML also accused Speaker Sapkota of aiding the party’s split. The UML at the time had urged the Speaker to sack 14 UML lawmakers, who defected to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) under Madhav Kumar Nepal. However, the Speaker refused to formalise the UML’s decision. The UML persistently protested in Parliament demanding Sapkota’s resignation as Speaker.In January 2019, Speaker Mahara was accused of siding with the ruling party during the passage of the National Medical Education Bill, even though the Congress had contested some of the bill's clauses. Additionally, he came under fire for not allowing Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to voice his opinion in the House before inviting then-prime minister Oli to speak on the contentious Guthi Bill. Ramchandra Paudel, a former Congress leader who became the Speaker after the 1996 midterm election, even faced impeachment for his role in Parliament. An impeachment motion was registered against him on September 23, 1998, for aiding the passage of a bill amid obstructions from the main opposition UML.In principle, the Speaker shouldn’t carry forward the House business even if a single parliamentarian raises his hand, says Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who has followed Parliament for more than two decades.The Speaker has the right to marshal security personnel against a parliamentarian if they disrupt the House proceedings, but s/he cannot carry forward the House business when there is an obstruction, Thapa told the Post.

These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent.

This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy.

The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels.

Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said.

A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  ","summary":"Nepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3.

Unconstitutional and undemocratic moves were made in the provinces through province heads, reads the statement. “We condemn such tendencies of the government. It is our conclusion that the government is becoming irresponsible, illiberal, arbitrary, undemocratic and totalitarian. Nepali Congress deplores such tendencies and has decided to oppose them resolutely in the federal parliament and provincial assemblies and out in the streets,” said the party’s statement. The Congress office bearer said that the home minister’s unsubstantiated accusations against Congress leaders was intolerable. “Time has come to show the party’s strength in the house as well as in the streets.”The party also took exception to the arrest of Kailash Sirohiya, chairman of the Kantipur Media Group (KMG), and concluded that it was an attempt to muzzle the Nepali press and threaten its very existence. A team of Nepal Police on Tuesday arrested Sirohiya from his office on the charge of forging citizenship documents. He is currently under judicial custody in Dhanusha, Janakpur.During the meeting, according to the multiple Nepali Congress leaders, several leaders and lawmakers demanded the resignation of the home minister, concluding that the government is increasingly marching on a totalitarian path. “Now onwards, the Congress should make the home minister’s resignation its single agenda and stand resolutely for it,” said a Congress office bearer. “Then the party should call for the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane and should not stop its protest until the government agrees to its demand.”Although the major political parties were ready to form the parliamentary panel and also constituted a task force, disagreements over its terms of reference stalled the process. Congress spokesman Mahat said provincial and district committees of the party will announce their separate protest programmes against the government and home minister.“Until now, we have been calling for a parliamentary probe against the home minister. But this is no longer just about Rabi Lamichhane, as the alliance is trying to weaken the constitution. In such a situation, the Nepali Congress will not remain a bystander,” Mahat said after the meeting.The arrest of Kantipur Chairman Kailash Sirohiya was widely discussed in the meeting, and almost all central working committee members condemned it. The meeting also denounced the government’s attempts to muzzle the media and terrorise journalists. “We deplore such activities of the government and demand a free and fair environment for the media,” the party said in its statement.“The government is duping citizens, protecting criminals and attacking the constitution, democracy and democratic values, and it is headed towards authoritarianism. The meeting also called for justice for millions of cooperative victims, formation of a parliamentary probe committee against the home minister and urged the government to take action against those involved in the cooperative scam,” said Mahat.“The way the home administration presented itself while arresting Sirohiya from his own office was totally a vendetta,” said Mahat. “We deplore the arbitrary arrest, which was motivated by a series of news published by Kantipur in favour of the cooperative victims.”Besides criticising the role and activities of the home minister and the government, some lawmakers also came down hard on the role of Speaker Devraj Ghimire. Despite obstruction from the Nepali Congress, Speaker Ghimire had started the House session to allow the Prime Minister Dahal to seek a trust vote on Monday. “To ask for justice for 75,000 cooperative victims and in order to ensure the return of their deposits, the party has decided to voice its concerns in the street and in Parliament,” said Ajay Babu Siwakoti, a central working committee member. “We will expand such protests at the provincial and local levels.Besides Siwakoti, Nain Singh Mahar and several other central working committee members also were firm on their demand for the home minister’s resignation. “It is no longer a question of just probing the home minister. Now, he must resign,” said Mahar. He labelled the decision to arrest the KMG chairman as being motivated by “vendetta and revenge, which means the home minister no longer has any moral right to remain in the position.” “The way Sirohiya was arrested, the government was clearly intent on exacting revenge against him,” said Chanda Chaurhary. “The home minister used to say that he will put Sirohiya behind bars for at least a day and now he has got his wish.” “The citizenship issue is just a pretext to take revenge against him,” she added.Dila Sangraula termed the home minister’s statement in the House as ‘violent’ and ‘uncivilised’ and said he should resign. “Now the Nepali Congress should also raise the issue of Giribandhu tea estate land scam,” she said. According to the Supreme Court’s verdict, a cabinet decision of the then KP Oli government had allowed the estate owners to illegally swap a huge swath of estate land in Birtamod, Jhapa with a similar piece of lower-value land somewhere else in the district.Not only the Congress, another opposition party, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party also demanded a parliamentary investigation against Home Minister Lamichanne. A meeting of the party’s work execution committee on Wednesday called for a probe against the home minister, who is facing charges of using two passports and of being involved in misusing deposits of at least three cooperatives.The law should be equal for all, said Mohan Shrestha, party spokesperson. “The way a probe was launched against Sirohiya, a similar investigation should be initiated against home minister Lamichhane. The same law should apply to a common man and the minister,” said Shrestha.

Unconstitutional and undemocratic moves were made in the provinces through province heads, reads the statement. “We condemn such tendencies of the government. It is our conclusion that the government is becoming irresponsible, illiberal, arbitrary, undemocratic and totalitarian. Nepali Congress deplores such tendencies and has decided to oppose them resolutely in the federal parliament and provincial assemblies and out in the streets,” said the party’s statement. The Congress office bearer said that the home minister’s unsubstantiated accusations against Congress leaders was intolerable. “Time has come to show the party’s strength in the house as well as in the streets.”The party also took exception to the arrest of Kailash Sirohiya, chairman of the Kantipur Media Group (KMG), and concluded that it was an attempt to muzzle the Nepali press and threaten its very existence. A team of Nepal Police on Tuesday arrested Sirohiya from his office on the charge of forging citizenship documents. He is currently under judicial custody in Dhanusha, Janakpur.During the meeting, according to the multiple Nepali Congress leaders, several leaders and lawmakers demanded the resignation of the home minister, concluding that the government is increasingly marching on a totalitarian path. “Now onwards, the Congress should make the home minister’s resignation its single agenda and stand resolutely for it,” said a Congress office bearer. “Then the party should call for the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane and should not stop its protest until the government agrees to its demand.”Although the major political parties were ready to form the parliamentary panel and also constituted a task force, disagreements over its terms of reference stalled the process. Congress spokesman Mahat said provincial and district committees of the party will announce their separate protest programmes against the government and home minister.“Until now, we have been calling for a parliamentary probe against the home minister. But this is no longer just about Rabi Lamichhane, as the alliance is trying to weaken the constitution. In such a situation, the Nepali Congress will not remain a bystander,” Mahat said after the meeting.The arrest of Kantipur Chairman Kailash Sirohiya was widely discussed in the meeting, and almost all central working committee members condemned it. The meeting also denounced the government’s attempts to muzzle the media and terrorise journalists. “We deplore such activities of the government and demand a free and fair environment for the media,” the party said in its statement.“The government is duping citizens, protecting criminals and attacking the constitution, democracy and democratic values, and it is headed towards authoritarianism. The meeting also called for justice for millions of cooperative victims, formation of a parliamentary probe committee against the home minister and urged the government to take action against those involved in the cooperative scam,” said Mahat.“The way the home administration presented itself while arresting Sirohiya from his own office was totally a vendetta,” said Mahat. “We deplore the arbitrary arrest, which was motivated by a series of news published by Kantipur in favour of the cooperative victims.”Besides criticising the role and activities of the home minister and the government, some lawmakers also came down hard on the role of Speaker Devraj Ghimire. Despite obstruction from the Nepali Congress, Speaker Ghimire had started the House session to allow the Prime Minister Dahal to seek a trust vote on Monday. “To ask for justice for 75,000 cooperative victims and in order to ensure the return of their deposits, the party has decided to voice its concerns in the street and in Parliament,” said Ajay Babu Siwakoti, a central working committee member. “We will expand such protests at the provincial and local levels.Besides Siwakoti, Nain Singh Mahar and several other central working committee members also were firm on their demand for the home minister’s resignation. “It is no longer a question of just probing the home minister. Now, he must resign,” said Mahar. He labelled the decision to arrest the KMG chairman as being motivated by “vendetta and revenge, which means the home minister no longer has any moral right to remain in the position.” “The way Sirohiya was arrested, the government was clearly intent on exacting revenge against him,” said Chanda Chaurhary. “The home minister used to say that he will put Sirohiya behind bars for at least a day and now he has got his wish.” “The citizenship issue is just a pretext to take revenge against him,” she added.Dila Sangraula termed the home minister’s statement in the House as ‘violent’ and ‘uncivilised’ and said he should resign. “Now the Nepali Congress should also raise the issue of Giribandhu tea estate land scam,” she said. According to the Supreme Court’s verdict, a cabinet decision of the then KP Oli government had allowed the estate owners to illegally swap a huge swath of estate land in Birtamod, Jhapa with a similar piece of lower-value land somewhere else in the district.Not only the Congress, another opposition party, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party also demanded a parliamentary investigation against Home Minister Lamichanne. A meeting of the party’s work execution committee on Wednesday called for a probe against the home minister, who is facing charges of using two passports and of being involved in misusing deposits of at least three cooperatives.The law should be equal for all, said Mohan Shrestha, party spokesperson. “The way a probe was launched against Sirohiya, a similar investigation should be initiated against home minister Lamichhane. The same law should apply to a common man and the minister,” said Shrestha.

As per their agreement, a four-member committee led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, who also is a CPN-UML leader, was formed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the parliamentary probe. The committee also includes Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the UML, and Shishir Khanal of the RSP. However, marathon meetings by the Giri-led panel starting Sunday morning could not agree on the ToR as the ruling parties stuck to their guns. The main opposition insisted that the investigation against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the primary focus of the probe panel. The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the RSP chair.“We don’t want the committee just for the sake of forming one. It needs to investigate what we are pressing for,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Nepali Congress chief whip. “The ruling parties want a probe panel with a broader objective, without investigating the home minister.” The ruling party leaders, however, say the Congress wants to form the committee with the objective of implicating a particular person (Lamichhane). “The sole objective of the Congress is to target an individual, which is not acceptable. Their demand has nothing to do with resolving the problems in the cooperative sector but only with implicating the home minister,” said the UML’s Bartaula.RSP leaders say they were even flexible about including (Lamichhane-linked) Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation, but only if the Congress agrees to allow the probe committee to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. “However, the Congress leaders didn’t agree. They backtracked from Saturday's agreement,” said the RSP’s Khanal. As the parties were in negotiations to finalise the ToR, a meeting of the House of Representatives called for 11 in the morning was postponed to 2 pm, which was again postponed to 4 pm. With no agreement in sight, the House meeting finally commenced at 6 in the evening with the single agenda of allowing Lamichhane to clarify the accusations against him.A meeting of the opposition parties held earlier in the morning had agreed to allow the home minister to answer questions raised against him, a chance he had long been asking for. The meeting called by the Congress was attended by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The opposition parties, particularly the Congress, which had been barring Lamichhane from addressing the House and presenting bills, had agreed to allow him to clarify the matter. Addressing the House after more than two months, Lamichhane not only defended himself, but also launched a personal attacks on several Congress leaders. Daring anyone to present concrete evidence of fraud, he said, “I challenge anyone to show evidence that any decision was made to acquire a loan from cooperatives, that I submitted any loan applications or signatures during the loan process, or that any funds were deposited into my account during my tenure at Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd.” He claimed that fake loan statements were prepared in the cooperatives in his name, for which he is not responsible. “I haven’t signed any documents nor have I been on their boards or served in official capacity in any of the cooperatives. Never ever did the Gorkha Media decide to take loans from cooperatives,” he said. “I am not responsible to clear the filth created by [then Gorkha Media chair] GB Rai.” He said he has been hounded based on the sensational media headlines targeting him. Lamichhane also lashed out at the Nepali Congress, revealing that the party had offered him the prime ministerial position for a term of a year and a half. He questioned the party's moral stance, wondering why they considered him unfit for the role of home minister yet found him suitable for prime minister.“If I am ineligible to serve as home minister, with what moral justification do I assume the post of prime minister? I wish to raise this question in the House today. Is the offer for the prime ministerial position still valid, or has it lapsed?” said Lamichhane.He asked if the Congress was ready to constitute a probe panel against everyone the media has linked with corruption. Without naming Gagan Thapa, the Congress general secretary, Lamichhane accused him of selling the country's secret information to foreigners. Citing media reports, he also claimed that Thapa had embezzled millions of rupees in the name of constructing a park at Tri-Chandra College and had misused agricultural grants. He also asked whether the main opposition would want a probe panel against those who have been accused of grabbing the land of Bansbari Leather and Shoe Factory, illegally registering public land in Tikapur under individuals’ name, and stealing luxury watches, or selling diplomatic passports. “Not just those who hold two or three citizenship, the agents and assets of the foreigners who hold one citizenship and one passport but sell the country’s secret information must be ousted as the lawmaker,” he said.In response, the Congress leaders said Lamichhane was rattled by the demands to investigate him. Holding a press meet after the House meeting, Congress leader Thapa said not just Lamichhane but his larger team is also involved in the embezzlement of savings from cooperatives. “It seems they [Lamichhane and other RSP leaders] are trying their luck at running a political party having already operated cooperatives and a media company,” he said. Stating that such committees have been constituted in the past, Thapa said if Ram Sharan Mahat, Bharat Mohan Adhikari or Janardan Sharma can be investigated, why not Lamichhane. He also challenged the home minister to uncover any wrongdoing on his part. “If I am guilty, I need to face legal action. If he is guilty he has to go through the same process,” he said asking Lamichhane why he fears investigations.Thapa challenged the home minister to investigate his entire life, starting from his birth in Prasuti Griha [maternity hospital] in Kathmandu. “Look at the kinds of allegations he [Lamichhane] has levelled against me. I request him: Please form a committee to probe me… Such a committee to probe Gagan Thapa can be formed even within the RSP. Please do it.”Thapa said his party primarily wants an investigation into the embezzlement of money in the cooperatives with Lamichhane’s involvement as they believe that police have been barred from investigating them.“We are clear the House cannot function until a probe committee is formed as per our demand. The vote of trust motion will also not move ahead so long as the committee is not formed,\" said Thapa.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take a vote of trust from the lower house on Monday. However, lack of agreement among the parties has put it into uncertainty. “We will try to agree on the ToR on Monday morning. Even if we can’t come to an agreement, the Congress should allow the vote on the trust motion as it is being done as per a constitutional obligation,” said Bartaula.

The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018, were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” warned Gautam. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health Officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.

The same vector also spreads elephantiasis or filariasis and Japanese encephalitis.Experts say mosquitoes become infected after feeding on infected birds, especially crows. When the infected mosquitoes bite humans and animals, they spread the virus, which can cause neurological problems and death in infected persons. India has reported a death from the West Nile virus in Kerala and six other cases of infections in Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode districts in recent days. Ojha said that Nepal is a member state of the World Health Organisation and receives every alert issued under the International Health Regulations. “Nepal is in the high-risk zone for an outbreak of the West Nile Virus due to its climate, presence of virus spreading vector, and mobility of people to and from the high-risk zones,” said Ojha. At least two cases of West Nile Virus infection were reported in a study carried out in Nepal in 2009-2010. Of 2,046 serum samples tested to examine the virus, two samples contained fragments of the genome resembling virus lineage 1.Experts say there is no specific treatment for West Nile virus. They suggest drinking plenty of water and fluids, resting, and taking medicine for fever in mild cases. “Those experiencing severe headache, high fever, weakness and confusion should see the doctor at the earliest,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “As mosquito breeding season has started, one should also take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.”Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis, as multiple studies have pointed out. The United Nations’s report “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases affected by climate drivers have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also reveals that the warming climate has caused the Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquitos to move to altitudes above 2,000 metres in Nepal. This shift in their distribution has serious implications, as over 100 species of Anopheles transmit malaria, more than 950 species of Aedes spread diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile virus, and over 1,000 species of Culex transmit Japanese encephalitis, filariasis, and West Nile virus.Vector-borne diseases, or VBDs, are spread by carriers like mosquitoes, sandflies, kissing bugs, and ticks. The report says that viruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal's hilly and mountainous areas.Experts say frequent movement of people is also a reason diseases are detected in new areas. When disease vectors bite an infected person, they transmit the disease, and the vectors’ entire generation gets infected.The Ministry of Health has reported over 1,000 cases of dengue infection since January, this year.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. ","summary":"Potatoes, a staple food in Nepal, are widely cultivated and consumed due to their versatility, nutritional value, and affordability, despite their occasional use as a derogatory term."},{"hash":"8f050af11428f186d46c4f64b300a3441341f2f7048fe6b8a30e31626fd61759","title":"**Eggs: Nutritional Powerhouse**\n\nEggs are packed with essential nutrients:\n\n* **Protein:** Rich in

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service.

So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry.

The Rhinos also qualified for their maiden Asia Cup and ended the year by securing their ticket to the T20 World Cup for the first time since 2014.But all that steel and resilience now seem to have suddenly vanished into the thin air.The year 2024 has been a rollercoaster ride for Rohit Paudel’s Rhinos, even in their roaring and perfect hunting ground—TU Cricket Ground, Kirtipur. They opened the League 2 with a loss against Namibia which ended their 15-match winning streak at home and won only one of their four matches of the home tri-series.They also failed to qualify for the 2025 Asia Cup last month and a four-wicket defeat to less fancied side Hong Kong in the third-place playoff of the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup also banished them out of the 2024 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup.One of their memorable moments came when they swept the three-match bilateral series against Canada in Kirtipur in their opening event of the year.However, their batting has been characterised by unsteadiness since and it was out in the open again against Canada in their first warm-up match of the T20 World Cup.Nepal’s bowling unit has been their strength always and proved key in the middle overs on Monday as well when they struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries limiting Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over, with Abinash Bohara taking 2-27, and Karan KC, Sompal Kami, Gulsan Jha, Lalit Rajbanshi and Sagar Dhakal all picking up one wicket each.Nicholas Kriton’s 50 runs off 39 balls and opener Navneet Dhaliwal’s 32 runs off 27 balls had driven Canada past 100 to give them a great start.Despite a tight bowling from Nepal, Ravinderpal Singh’s explosive 17-ball 41 guided Canada to 183-7.Nepal could never stay in the chase of an 184-run target.Opener Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh struggled again and departed making 10 (16) and 22 (22), respectively.Skipper Paudel has been the most consistent batter for Nepal. He was Nepal’s leading run-scorer last year with 403 T20I runs from 13 innings and was facing Canada having scored 265 runs from four innings that included a century and two half-centuries—all of which came during the five-match T20 series West Indies A.He was out for a duck in his last outing—the fifth T20 against West Indies A—and failed to make a mark again after being dismissed for one.Sundeep Jora (6), Jha (0), Kami (4), Dhakal (5) and Bohara (0) all handled the bat poorly and returned to the pavilion with single digit scores, as Nepal could not only manage 120 runs.Canada’s Dilon Heyliger returned the match figures of 4-20 in this 2.3 over spell. Jeremy Gordon and Saad Bin Zafar took two wickets each while Kaleem Sana and Pragat Singh pocketed one wicket apiece.Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee also had a golden year in 2023.During the Asian Games, Malla scored a century off just 34 balls against Mongolia. The score stands as the second fastest T20I century. Malla scored 402 runs in his 12 innings last year. After struggling with the bat most of this year, he is regaining his shape gradually at a perfect time. He top-scored against Canada with 37 runs off 30 balls, carrying his form from this last match against West Indies A where he scored a valiant 37 not out off 18 balls.Airee is Nepal’s highest run-scorer in the T20Is with 1626 runs from 56 innings. He scored a 50 off just nine balls against Mongolia last year to break the record for fastest fifty in T20s. A month ago, the big-hitting finisher smashed six sixes in an over during the Premier Cup against Qatar, joining the ranks of Yuvraj Singh and Kieron Pollard in achieving the rare feat in men’s T20I. Airee did not bat against Canada.Anil Sah’s batting does not look like a bigger concern. He was outstanding again and comfortably scored 24 runs off 16 balls. He returned to the national team for Nepal’s home series against Canada in February and immediately made an impact with a fifty and an unbeaten century.

The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.Overnight, its forces battered the city with airstrikes and tank fire, residents said, pressing the offensive despite an international outcry over an attack on Sunday that sparked a massive blaze in a tent camp, killing at least 45 Palestinians, more than half of them children, women and the elderly.Global leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated “humanitarian zone” where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere in Gaza had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order for a halt to Israel’s assault.In another move purportedly aimed at reining in the violence, Spain, Ireland and Norway were to officially recognise a Palestinian state on Tuesday.The three countries have said they hope their decision will accelerate efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel’s war against Hamas militants, now in its eighth month, that has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.Residents said Rafah’s Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday’s night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.“Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,” one resident told Reuters via a chat app.Around one million people - many repeatedly displaced by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.A video obtained by Reuters showed families on the move again, carrying their belongings through Rafah’s shattered streets, their weary children trailing behind them.“There are a lot of attacks, smoke and dust. It is death from God...The (Israelis) are hitting everywhere. We’re tired,” said Moayad Fusaifas, pushing along belongings on two bicycles.ISRAEL SAYS IT’S IN COMBAT NEAR EGYPT BORDERSince Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the outskirts and entered some eastern districts but had not yet moved into the city in full force.In recent days, Israeli tanks have thrust towards western neighbourhoods and taken up positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area.Witnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.The Israeli military said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt “based on intelligence indicating the presence of terror targets”.Israeli troops were engaged in close-quarter combat and were locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure, it said in a statement.Israel has kept up attacks despite the ruling by the International Court of Justice on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the top UN court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there.More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.Since Sunday’s strike on the tent camp, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, health officials in the Hamas-run enclave said.In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave’s eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.In some residential districts from which Israeli forces have retreated, civil emergency teams said they were recovering bodies from the ruins.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  "},{"hash":"84f1933fdba456be437ff6677fe31b608adc5f5840323d43f834bd7de32204c9","title":"prachanda-do-you-hear-us","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/05/27/prachanda-do-you-hear-us","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/LeadPostPhoto-1716825154.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716768000000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"“Harvard, do you hear us?” Shruthi Kumar, a graduating student, raised this poignant question during her off-script speech at the Harvard University Commencement on May 23.

Most observers, including reputed international bodies like Amnesty International and the International Federation of Journalists, smell a rat in this incident.

Democracy suffers damage once that independent space shrinks. It doesn’t matter whether one loves or hates KMG. I have my grievances against it and have publicly expressed some of them. I want it to be more inclusive and accommodating of diverse voices. It should do more to support the cause of lower classes, castes and neglected regions and religions. However, this is not the time, as some people are doing, to vilify and pour anger at KMG and discuss its weaknesses and limitations. This would only serve the purpose of the parties and leaders in power who are intent on sapping the freedom of expression for their own vested interests. I warn people against the coalition leadership’s potentially dangerous road towards greater intolerance and authoritarianism. I think the opposition’s—Nepali Congress party—assertion along this line is timely and appropriate. We need to be vigilant about the communists and the populists colluding to shrink the democratic space. Responsible citizens should always put their finger in the dyke. Demoralising businesses The rulers’ ultimate gain from this undue punishment of Nepal’s top media entrepreneur is unknown, but they have already alarmed the business community. This is particularly not good in a persistently failing economy.

This has sent a wrong signal to the public and deeply offended the Madheshi community. Nepal is highly casteist and racist. People of the southern plains bear the brunt of hill racism. They are often seen as outsiders. This stems from a longstanding policy of the ruling elites over a long period. Hundreds of thousands of Madhesis, many of them Dalits, are not only landless but also stateless. They’ve been denied citizenship even after living in the country for many generations. Frustratingly, even those Madheshis who have lived here for long and significantly contributed to society, find their belonging to the land constantly questioned. If someone like Sirohiya, who owns the largest media house in the country, and has worked to restore democracy and human rights for decades, finds himself suspected as an illegal alien, can anyone imagine the plight of ordinary Madheshis? Isn’t this shameless behaviour of the Nepali state? Has the hill racism become worse in the republican era? Concerned leaders and their blind supporters may pretend not to know anything, but people are keenly watching. Such a racist attitude of the state expressed overtly or covertly, does not bode well for our peaceful and prosperous future. Today, social media is abuzz with highly critical and racist comments against Sirohiya. The smear campaign against him has peaked.

The same event can impact people differently due to their pre-existing conditions, including economic status, occupation, literacy, ethnicity, caste, age, disability, and gender. Marginalised and minority groups are generally more vulnerable and are disproportionately affected by disasters. A 2007 study, “The Gendered Nature of Natural Disasters: The Impact of Catastrophic Events on the Gender Gap in Life Expectancy, 1981–2002”, shows that the mortality rates of women during a disaster are several times higher than that of men. Moreover, even though the life expectancy of women is higher than that of men, natural disasters lower the life expectancy of women. This suggests that women are more vulnerable than men. Such vulnerability is not based on biological or physiological differences but rather due to the socially constructed unequal gender norms that govern what roles women and men should play and how they should behave.More often than not, women are caregivers of the household. They are responsible for domestic tasks, child-bearing/rearing and caring for the elderly, sick or dependent family members. In addition, they may also be balancing work and community management roles. These roles receive little value as they do not generate income and leave women little time for income-generating activities. Consequently, women may have limited access and control over resources, undermining their decision-making power. Furthermore, social roles dictate social behaviour, such as not being able to leave home without the permission of a male family member and failing to learn or perform so-called masculine skills such as swimming or climbing trees. Due to these socially constructed constraints, women are inept and less willing to save themselves.Nepal's disaster risk reduction (DRR) and management systems have come a long way from the early reactive response-centric approaches to the current proactive approach, emphasising prevention and preparedness and increasing attention to gender-specific needs in the disaster context. Yet, they fall short of addressing vulnerabilities arising from pre-existing gendered social structures and unequal power relations, which affect people’s ability to respond to disaster and their lives in post-disaster contexts.Post-disaster, most of the relief and assistance provided to women is concerned with addressing the needs of pregnant and lactating women, distributing menstruation hygiene kits and establishing safe spaces. While these forms of relief are necessary and even life-saving, they reduce the needs of women to simply the needs associated with their reproductive and caregiving role and do not address the needs of women who do not fall under the category of being either pregnant, lactating, or menstruating.A study analysing the gendered impact of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake found that many women could not access relief or reconstruction aid because they were unable to provide the documentation (proof of citizenship, title to house/land). Similarly, many women, having been displaced by the earthquake and without any support to re-establish their livelihood, entered the entertainment sector, resorting to work in cabin restaurants and dance bars where they may be subject to sexual abuse. This notable rise in women seeking work in this sector results from conditions after the earthquake, but planners and policymakers do not generally consider it. As most support provided post-disaster is response-oriented and relief-focused and envisioned to achieve only short-term goals, this leaves out many other issues, such as access to general health care, food, shelter, livelihood opportunities and citizenships.Gender issues are considered an afterthought to the current DRR policies and practices. These policies add to the prevailing unequal institutional structure and do not challenge unequal gender relations and power structures, which is the root cause of the issue. Furthermore, DRR policies and practices are still imagined within traditionally defined gender roles, which promote and reinforce gender stereotypes.DRR policies and frameworks primarily view women as a monolithic identity, and the intersectionality within gendered experiences is largely ignored. Vulnerability is affected by many other factors, such as economic status, occupation, literacy, ethnicity, caste, age and disability. Analysing vulnerability by considering these multiple factors and how they inter-relate reveals that not all women are equally vulnerable and that some are multiple burdened.Furthermore, DRR strategies proposed to reduce disaster risk may serve to subject women and girls to increased hardships, harassment and exploitation. A study on the impact of Covid-19 on Nepali Women reports that due to women’s role as caregivers and their overrepresentation in service and care-oriented fields, they were more vulnerable to infection. Women were also at higher risk of falling into extreme poverty during the pandemic as they were more likely than men to be working informally. Furthermore, the lockdowns added extra childcare and domestic workload, which women mostly took up. This forced women to either quit their jobs or permanently drop out of the labour force, and it most likely decreased the participation of girls in online classes and increased the rate at which girls drop out in rural areas. The lockdowns also brought about a surge in gender-based violence cases. However, due to increased attention to the pandemic, many who sought to report incidents of abuse or seek support could not access those services promptly.Similarly, a survey by WOREC found that during the pandemic, returning migrant workers were seen as transmitters of disease and faced exclusion. Moreover, women migrant workers were negatively portrayed in social media and online news portals as promiscuous, due to which they were subject to further psychological and physical harassment from their families. Even within detention centres where returning migrants were to quarantine, women were not safe from sexual assault.Even when DRR programmes in good faith recognise women’s potential to respond to disasters, this adds more responsibility to women who now, in addition to fulfilling their caregiver, reproductive and productive roles, must also act as responders to disasters or as participants in processes of reconstruction, spending time rebuilding homes, livelihoods, and communities. This additional responsibility can negatively impact their health and well-being and create a knock-on effect on their daughters’ well-being if they have to step in to help their mothers.In the article, “Sex disaggregation alone will not energize equality”, Sarah Bradshaw argues that instead of policies serving women, women now serve policy agendas where the feminisation of responsibility is a tactic to achieve multiple goals with a single project. “The ‘solution’ involves women, but it is not about women or improving women’s welfare”. Such superficial inclusion of women may improve disaster response and reduce disaster risk. However, they will not change women’s risk of disaster. Therefore, to reduce disaster risk for women, we must focus on reducing gender inequalities. ","summary":"Disaster risk refers to exposure to hazards and vulnerability to exposed elements. The same event can impact people differently due to their pre-existing conditions, including economic status, occupation, literacy, ethnicity, caste, age, disability, and gender. Marginalised and minority groups are generally more vulnerable and are disproportionately affected by disasters. A 2007 study, “The Gendered Nature of Natural Disasters: The Impact of Catastrophic Events on the Gender Gap in Life Expectancy, 1981–2002”, shows that the mortality rates of women during a disaster are several times higher than that of men. Moreover, even though the life expectancy of women is higher than that of men, natural disasters lower the life expectancy of women. This suggests that women are more vulnerable than men. Such vulnerability is not based on biological or physiological differences but rather due to the socially constructed unequal gender norms that govern what roles women and men should play and how they should behave.More often than not, women are caregivers of the household. They are responsible for domestic tasks, child-bearing/rearing and caring for the elderly, sick or dependent family members. In addition, they may also be balancing work and community management roles. These roles receive little value as they do not generate income and leave women little time for income-generating activities. Consequently, women may have limited access and control over resources, undermining their decision-making power. Furthermore, social roles dictate social behaviour, such as not being able to leave home without the permission of a male family member and failing to learn or perform so-called masculine skills such as swimming or climbing trees. Due to these socially constructed constraints, women are inept and less willing to save themselves.Nepal's disaster risk reduction (DRR) and management systems have come a long way from the early reactive response-centric approaches to the current proactive approach, emphasising prevention and preparedness and increasing attention to gender-specific needs in the disaster context.

In this piece, we will focus on the regulatory gaps primarily related to cybersecurity and data protection that the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) must quickly address. The fintech ecosystem in Nepal is growing, but it remains fragile in terms of cybersecurity and data protection. The NRB regulation should promote fintech innovation while also considering the importance of data protection and security.Technology is evolving, and so are cyber-attacks. In 2019, hackers stole almost Rs18.9 million from 13 Nepali banks using ATM terminals. They spoofed the Nepal Electronic Payment Systems Limited (NEPS) link using fake cards, which enabled them to take money from the ATMs by independently verifying all the information of the Nepal bank's clients. This incident was one of the most prominent cases of cross-banking transactions via ATM cash-out hack and could happen again. Hence, the NRB should be aware of such incidents. The court decided to punish the perpetrators; however, as it wasn’t physical loot, a detailed investigation to find out the root cause would have been an appropriate step by the central bank. Such investigations could provide insights and further strengthen the system security of such companies and bank and financial institutions in Nepal.Clause 44 of the Payment and Settlement Bylaw, 2077 (First Amendment, 2080) addresses the liability of the payment system operators (PSO)/payment service providers (PSP) in case of any disputes or any other loss arising from incidents such as cyber-attacks. However, the absence of explicit guidance regarding the extent of liability raises concerns. For instance, a PSO with a paid-up capital of Rs50 million must be given clear guidelines on their liability in the worst-case scenario, or there must be a limit on how much of their customers’ funds they can retain. Additionally, it is the right time to introduce a government guarantee fund, like the deposit and credit guarantee fund (DCGF), to protect the public from loss arising from data breaches and other cyber incidents. If the government had set up such funds, it would have been more vigilant and strict on cybersecurity measures. This would be a win-win situation for all parties.Furthermore, no insurance products are available in Nepal to hedge companies against any loss due to data breaches or similar security incidents. The lack of insurance coverage leaves companies vulnerable to hacking and losses. It might be appropriate for the regulator to open a pathway for companies in Nepal to obtain cyber insurance, even from foreign companies, until insurance companies in Nepal launch such products.Similarly, Clause 45 of the Bylaw and Directive No. 3 of the NRB Unified Directive Related to Payment Systems, 2079, discusses the security policies and practices for PSO/PSP. Implementing a uniform requirement for payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27,000 certifications across all financial institutions involved in payment processing would ensure a data protection baseline, mitigating the risks of cyber threats. The language of the Directive is clear: A licensed institution shall adhere to the standards of PCI DSS, Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) Standard, EMV Contactless Standard, etc. However, a mechanism to ensure that these standards are followed is unclear. Had it been mentioned that certification like PCI DSS is mandatory, it would have made more sense since an independent third party always issues a certification. Similarly, regulatory requirements always act as the baseline for security, and these NRB guidelines are the minimum requirements spread across the industry. Further, data security is not a matter of securing them for a point of time only; it is a regular, ongoing activity that needs the attention of the stakeholders. Similarly, if we look through most payment-related companies’ websites, except for a few big players, we don’t find much information related to their security and related certifications.A provision requiring each licensed institution to disclose its licenses and certifications, commitment to data security, and other related matters on its website and update it regularly must be introduced to increase public awareness and invoke dialogues between the stakeholders. Similarly, Clause 45 of the Bylaw contains a provision for system audit while it also mentions a provision for an annual system audit. In contrast, the Directive states that a system audit is mandatory after a year of operation and every two years when there are no changes in the existing system. These two provisions contradict each other, and the regulator must provide clarification on the same. Two years to conduct a system audit is pretty long, and so payment-related institutions must conduct at least an annual system audit in light of the rise of cyber threats in the present context.Awareness of cyber threats and cybersecurity is a pressing need today since most occur due to human negligence. Social engineering is the most common way through which intruders can gather data and find loopholes in a payment system. To improve cyber risk measures, visibility is required on the organisation's risk dashboard, covering all inherent risk levels to provide a picture of what is being defended. Lastly, continuous monitoring and a proactive approach to risk management is the only way against cyber-attacks. The country’s payment industry is still in its infancy, and before something worse happens, all the stakeholders must join hands to protect the public’s interest.

Often, men in such childless unions are asked to remarry so that they can have babies and take the family lineage forward. According to a 2020 study, Nepali couples are often put under pressure into having a child in the first year of their marriage, even when both husband and wife don’t want a baby. Even if one or the other member of a couple is infertile, another research in West Africa suggests, infertility in itself is not a cause for women’s anguish, it's also what is known as the Social Pressure for Pregnancy (SSP). Most women who failed to conceive cited external pressure from families and society as the main cause of their distress.As is the case in much of the world, the fertility rate in Nepal has been on a steady decline. For instance, in the two decades since 2002, there was a 50 percent dip in the country’s fertility rate. Greater awareness on family planning, increasing literacy and the rise in the number of families where both partners earn are responsible for this decline.
