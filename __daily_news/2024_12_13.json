Nepal was also impacted by the global economy that was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other stressors. It is in such situation that Paudel is handling the responsibility as the Finance Minister.The following are the excerpts of an interview RSS had with the Finance Minister, centering on the performance of the Finance Ministry in the four months since he took charge of office, on the improvement said to have been witnessed in the economy at present and on the UML's internal politics. \nQ. Four months have passed since you took the reins of the Finance Ministry. What initiatives did you take to address the problems of the economy and to make it vibrant during this period? \nA. We are focused on acquiring minute information on the overall economic situation of the country, on identifying the problems and on addressing them. As a result, signs of improvement have been seen in the economy. The confidence of the private sector has increased and investment climate is being created. \nWe prepared a 100-day action plan soon after taking charge of office and we have implemented more than 90 percent of these. We have formed the High level Economic Sector Reform Recommendation Commission comprising of seasoned economists, experts and the representatives of the umbrella organizations of the private sector for the improvement of the country economy. In the mean time, we have also carried out some important works in the policy area as well. \nMany laws and work procedures related to different sectors as insurance, customs, taxation, revenue mobilization among others have been passed and come into implementation. These include the Insurance Regulation, the Regulation Related to Issuance and Transaction of Shares of Small and Medium Corporations, the Customs Tariff Regulation, the Internal Revenue Mobilization Strategy, the Policy on Mobilization of Loans and Investment in Public Corporations and the Work Procedure on Issuance and Management of Internal Loan.\nThe luggage and vehicle scanner machine has been brought into use at the Tatopani Customs. The system of sending information about the main stages of the customs invoice to the import and export traders through SMS or e-mail has been operated. Works on dematerialization of the Citizens Saving Bonds and the Foreign Employment Saving Bonds have been initiated.\nQ. You said that many works have been carried out, but payment to the construction entrepreneurs and resolution of problems to do with revenue collection, capital expenditure and others still remain, isn't so? \nA. There was this worrying situation of dues remaining to be paid from the previous year as well when we took the responsibility. The Finance Ministry has facilitated in fulfilling the obligation of remaining payments in the meantime and the payment is being made gradually. \nEfforts are being made to removing the existing confusions regarding classification of projects and ensuring the multi-year resources, and to move ahead on the basis of clear criteria. There has been a significant improvement in foreign currency reserve, balance of payment, remittance inflow, the liquidity situation of banks and interest rate, among other topics. The capital market has become vibrant and in an improved situation. The appointment of the Chairperson of the Securities Board has been made after long hiatus. \nThe revenue growth rate which was 3.2 in the first four months of the last fiscal year has increased by 17 percent in the corresponding period of this fiscal year. Various measures as mobilization of rapid patrol team have been adopted for checking revenue leakage. The situation of foreign aid (grants and loans) mobilization is comparatively becoming positive. Similarly, inflation and market price are under control. The capital expenditure has increased by four billion this year as compared to the first four months of the last year. The NRNA Development Fund, which has been established to promote the non-resident Nepalis' investment in the country, is in the implementation phase. \nPreparation works have been moved forward for re-operation of the closed and sick industries and businesses under the government's ownership by determining their condition. Similarly, preparations have been made to expand the capacity of those industries already in operation. Cooperation has been extended and facilitation done in order to boost the morale of every sector of production, including the private sector. \nAccording to the World Bank (WB), the economic growth rate which was constricted to 3.9 percent last year is estimated to reach 5.1 percent this year. The basis is being prepared for Nepal's graduation from the status of a least-developed country to a developing one by 2026. Some weeks back, we have completed the work related to 'sovereign country rating' by the Fitch Ratings, and achieved a score of BB minus in the ratings. This has proved that Nepal is in the second position after India in South Asia. The message that Nepal is a favourable destination for investment has been spread globally by this.\nQ. It seems that you are satisfied with your deliveries. But the mass especially the private sector express worrisome over the situation. What is your say?\nA. we are not saying that problems are entirely addressed. We are aware of our economic issues.  \nOur responsibility is to take the lead to explore solutions to the issues and make the economy vibrant. Our intention is to say that there were piles of problems when we assumed the responsibility. There were numerous questions in regard to resource management, appropriation skills, and budgetary discipline.   Numerous projects were added at once and the unrealistic resource management was estimated with the goal of 31 percent growth. \nOverall, industrial production had decreased up to 60 percent, not only exports but also imports had plummeted significantly with job cuts heavily.  The revenue mobilization and the status of capital expenditures were worrying with the situation forcing the government to sideline from its responsibility for payment.  \nBut now the signs of improvements are visible and they should be further strengthened. Liquidity in banks and the availability of loans at relatively lower interest rates are needed to be utilized for productivity and production growth and the creation of jobs. The genuine demands of the private sector should be addressed. Mass citizenship should be encouraged to get connected to employment or self-employment to increase income. And, we are working towards that end. \nWe are more focused on achieving an economic vibrancy, on revenue mobilization, and on encouraging capital expenditures. \nQ. Now let's proceed to a different context.  There are rumors that the coalition government will not complete its full terms due to a rift between the Nepali Congress and the CPN (UML).  Are you sure to take this coalition to its \"destination\"?\nA.   Social justice is the mass aspiration after the promulgation of the Constitution. But, political instability was preventing us from advancing towards that end. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN (UML) with a long history, contributions, and presence had no option to form a coalition for achieving political stability and finding a path to development within the House of Representatives. This coalition is not conditioned by any interests except the protection of the Constitution, achievement of development supported by political stability, and the elimination of all sorts of extremisms and instability.  The primary object of this coalition is to achieve development and prosperity along with social justice.\n However, some forces were actively working to make the formation of this alliance impossible. It was formed by making all such efforts a failure.  This alliance will go until the 2084 BS elections and we are fully confident of this. \nQ. Does it mean that the NC-UML alliance has no problems at all?\nA. You may be surprised, but it is a fact that to date, we face no such issues.  We have already formed a common mechanism comprising the Prime Minister, NC President, and the top leaders of both political parties for the government's operation, and such a mechanism is assisted by a four-member task force.  We have developed a system of floating any matter before the task force and a mechanism for discussions before reaching a decision and this avoids the emergency of political misunderstanding on the topic.  The discussions in the task force, mechanism, and the Council of Ministers are going on lively and cordially and this system will be further strengthened.  This coalition will be continued till the next general elections. \nQ. Prime Minister KP Sharma recently paid an official visit to northern neighbor the People's Republic of China. How do you assess this visit?\nA.  The Prime Minister's visit to China was highly successful and historic. This has taken the Nepal-China relations to a new height. During the visit, the implementation of past agreements was highly realized and some new historic agreements were observed. Such agreements are of special and long-term significance in terms of Nepal's economic development, especially infrastructure development. \nQ. Despite your claim, the comments over the visit are mixed. Some leaders within from the NC over the agreements especially the Framework on BRI Cooperation Agreement reflect dissatisfactions.  What is your say? \nA.  As of my understanding, the NC Party President's views are the official opinions of the Nepali Congress (NC).  The NC President described the visit as highly successful, praising the performance of the government.   Not only that, the top leadership of both political parties held a serious discussion on the matter before signing the Framework and the exchange of the agreement went as per the previous discussions and understanding. \nQ. It is said that the intra-rift within the UML is deepening, though invisible.  What is your say?\nA. The CPN (UML) is that party that has no questions over its policy and leadership. We are working for social transformations in Nepali society abiding by the principle of people's multi-party democracy.  The entire party hierarchy expresses a deep faith in this principle and the conclusions of the 10th National Congress.  We are confident of the good leadership of the party Chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and have due respect for him. Without his visionary leadership, it would not been possible for the party to arrive at the present situation.  The misunderstanding and rifts within the party may appear and they will be addressed, keeping the party unity intact. \nQ. Does that mean KP Oli will remain in the post of party chairman even after the 11th General Convention? Is it that leaders of your generation lack the self-confidence of leading the party?\nA. The issue is not of self-confidence, it is about capable leadership. Our Party Chairman Honourable KP Sharma Oli is not only leading in a qualified manner the CPN (UML) but also the entire nation. There is no other leader in the UML like him equal in capability, activeness and result-oriented works. So, why search for alternative? Leadership is not a topic of one's fancy. This is a topic that is related to one's legacy, contribution, efficiency and acceptance in the national and international context. I want to say this clearly here that he (KP Oli) will be unanimously elected the party chairman through the 11th National Convention. There should be no doubt about this.\n---\n","summary":"\n    KATHMANDU: Vice Chairman of CPN (UML) Bishnu Prasad Paudel is the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister in the present government. Nepal was also impacted by the global economy that was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other stressors. It is in such situation that Paudel is handling the responsibility as the Finance Minister.The following are the excerpts of an interview RSS had with the Finance Minister, centering on the performance of the Finance Ministry in the four months since he took charge of office, on the improvement said to have been witnessed in the economy at present and on the UML's internal politics. \nQ. Four months have passed since you took the reins of the Finance Ministry. What initiatives did you take to address the problems of the economy and to make it vibrant during this period? \nA. We are focused on acquiring minute information on the overall economic situation of the country, on identifying the problems and on addressing them. As a result, signs of improvement have been seen in the economy. The confidence of the private sector has increased and investment climate is being created. \nWe prepared a 100-day action plan soon after taking charge of office and we have implemented more than 90 percent of these. We have formed the High level Economic Sector Reform Recommendation Commission comprising of seasoned economists, experts and the representatives of the umbrella organizations of the private sector for the improvement of the country economy. In the mean time, we have also carried out some important works in the policy area as well. \nMany laws and work procedures related to different sectors as insurance, customs, taxation, revenue mobilization among others have been passed and come into implementation. These include the Insurance Regulation, the Regulation Related to Issuance and Transaction of Shares of Small and Medium Corporations, the Customs Tariff Regulation, the Internal Revenue Mobilization Strategy, the Policy on Mobilization of Loans and Investment in Public Corporations and the Work Procedure on Issuance and Management of Internal Loan.\nThe luggage and vehicle scanner machine has been brought into use at the Tatopani Customs. The system of sending information about the main stages of the customs invoice to the import and export traders through SMS or e-mail has been operated. Works on dematerialization of the Citizens Saving Bonds and the Foreign Employment Saving Bonds have been initiated.\nQ. You said that many works have been carried out, but payment to the construction entrepreneurs and resolution of problems to do with revenue collection, capital expenditure and others still remain, isn't so? \nA. There was this worrying situation of dues remaining to be paid from the previous year as well when we took the responsibility. The Finance Ministry has facilitated in fulfilling the obligation of remaining payments in the meantime and the payment is being made gradually. \nEfforts are being made to removing the existing confusions regarding classification of projects and ensuring the multi-year resources, and to move ahead on the basis of clear criteria. There has been a significant improvement in foreign currency reserve, balance of payment, remittance inflow, the liquidity situation of banks and interest rate, among other topics. The capital market has become vibrant and in an improved situation. The appointment of the Chairperson of the Securities Board has been made after long hiatus. \nThe revenue growth rate which was 3.2 in the first four months of the last fiscal year has increased by 17 percent in the corresponding period of this fiscal year. Various measures as mobilization of rapid patrol team have been adopted for checking revenue leakage. The situation of foreign aid (grants and loans) mobilization is comparatively becoming positive. Similarly, inflation and market price are under control. The capital expenditure has increased by four billion this year as compared to the first four months of the last year. The NRNA Development Fund, which has been established to promote the non-resident Nepalis' investment in the country, is in the implementation phase. \nPreparation works have been moved forward for re-operation of the closed and sick industries and businesses under the government's ownership by determining their condition. Similarly, preparations have been made to expand the capacity of those industries already in operation. Cooperation has been extended and facilitation done in order to boost the morale of every sector of production, including the private sector. \nAccording to the World Bank (WB), the economic growth rate which was constricted to 3.9 percent last year is estimated to reach 5.1 percent this year. The basis is being prepared for Nepal's graduation from the status of a least-developed country to a developing one by 2026. Some weeks back, we have completed the work related to 'sovereign country rating' by the Fitch Ratings, and achieved a score of BB minus in the ratings. This has proved that Nepal is in the second position after India in South Asia. The message that Nepal is a favourable destination for investment has been spread globally by this.\nQ. It seems that you are satisfied with your deliveries. But the mass especially the private sector express worrisome over the situation. What is your say?\nA. we are not saying that problems are entirely addressed. We are aware of our economic issues.  \nOur responsibility is to take the lead to explore solutions to the issues and make the economy vibrant. Our intention is to say that there were piles of problems when we assumed the responsibility. There were numerous questions in regard to resource management, appropriation skills, and budgetary discipline.   Numerous projects were added at once and the unrealistic resource management was estimated with the goal of 31 percent growth. \nOverall, industrial production had decreased up to 60 percent, not only exports but also imports had plummeted significantly with job cuts heavily.  The revenue mobilization and the status of capital expenditures were worrying with the situation forcing the government to sideline from its responsibility for payment.  \nBut now the signs of improvements are visible and they should be further strengthened. Liquidity in banks and the availability of loans at relatively lower interest rates are needed to be utilized for productivity and production growth and the creation of jobs. The genuine demands of the private sector should be addressed. Mass citizenship should be encouraged to get connected to employment or self-employment to increase income. And, we are working towards that end. \nWe are more focused on achieving an economic vibrancy, on revenue mobilization, and on encouraging capital expenditures. \nQ. Now let's proceed to a different context.  There are rumors that the coalition government will not complete its full terms due to a rift between the Nepali Congress and the CPN (UML).  Are you sure to take this coalition to its \"destination\"?\nA.   Social justice is the mass aspiration after the promulgation of the Constitution. But, political instability was preventing us from advancing towards that end. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN (UML) with a long history, contributions, and presence had no option to form a coalition for achieving political stability and finding a path to development within the House of Representatives. This coalition is not conditioned by any interests except the protection of the Constitution, achievement of development supported by political stability, and the elimination of all sorts of extremisms and instability.  The primary object of this coalition is to achieve development and prosperity along with social justice.\n However, some forces were actively working to make the formation of this alliance impossible. It was formed by making all such efforts a failure.  This alliance will go until the 2084 BS elections and we are fully confident of this. \nQ. Does it mean that the NC-UML alliance has no problems at all?\nA. You may be surprised, but it is a fact that to date, we face no such issues.  We have already formed a common mechanism comprising the Prime Minister, NC President, and the top leaders of both political parties for the government's operation, and such a mechanism is assisted by a four-member task force.  We have developed a system of floating any matter before the task force and a mechanism for discussions before reaching a decision and this avoids the emergency of political misunderstanding on the topic.  The discussions in the task force, mechanism, and the Council of Ministers are going on lively and cordially and this system will be further strengthened.  This coalition will be continued till the next general elections. \nQ. Prime Minister KP Sharma recently paid an official visit to northern neighbor the People's Republic of China. How do you assess this visit?\nA.  The Prime Minister's visit to China was highly successful and historic. This has taken the Nepal-China relations to a new height. During the visit, the implementation of past agreements was highly realized and some new historic agreements were observed. Such agreements are of special and long-term significance in terms of Nepal's economic development, especially infrastructure development. \nQ. Despite your claim, the comments over the visit are mixed. Some leaders within from the NC over the agreements especially the Framework on BRI Cooperation Agreement reflect dissatisfactions.  What is your say? \nA.  As of my understanding, the NC Party President's views are the official opinions of the Nepali Congress (NC).  The NC President described the visit as highly successful, praising the performance of the government.   Not only that, the top leadership of both political parties held a serious discussion on the matter before signing the Framework and the exchange of the agreement went as per the previous discussions and understanding. \nQ. It is said that the intra-rift within the UML is deepening, though invisible.  What is your say?\nA. The CPN (UML) is that party that has no questions over its policy and leadership. We are working for social transformations in Nepali society abiding by the principle of people's multi-party democracy.  The entire party hierarchy expresses a deep faith in this principle and the conclusions of the 10th National Congress.  We are confident of the good leadership of the party Chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and have due respect for him. Without his visionary leadership, it would not been possible for the party to arrive at the present situation.  The misunderstanding and rifts within the party may appear and they will be addressed, keeping the party unity intact. \nQ. Does that mean KP Oli will remain in the post of party chairman even after the 11th General Convention? Is it that leaders of your generation lack the self-confidence of leading the party?\nA. The issue is not of self-confidence, it is about capable leadership. Our Party Chairman Honourable KP Sharma Oli is not only leading in a qualified manner the CPN (UML) but also the entire nation. There is no other leader in the UML like him equal in capability, activeness and result-oriented works. So, why search for alternative? Leadership is not a topic of one's fancy. This is a topic that is related to one's legacy, contribution, efficiency and acceptance in the national and international context. I want to say this clearly here that he (KP Oli) will be unanimously elected the party chairman through the 11th National Convention. There should be no doubt about this.\n---\n"},{"hash":"ec38a9c857954916784358388b8317cb02721a6308d453701f14e0796039dc2c","title":"private-sector-should-be-encouraged-to-build-self-reliant-economy-chair-dahal","date":1733961600000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/politics/private-sector-should-be-encouraged-to-build-self-reliant-economy-chair-dahal","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/prachanda1733835240_1024.jpg","category":"politics","content":"\n    CHITWAN: Chairperson of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' has said industrialists and entrepreneurs should move ahead keeping the self-reliant national economy in center.Addressing the third annual general assembly of Federation of Nepalese Industry and Trade at Bharatpur in Chitwan today, Chair Dahal pointed out the need of uplifting the middle-class people to make country's economy strong.  \n\"The country has now been importing many goods including foods though it had been exporting food and was self-dependent on it.

belonging to the Abu al-Tarabish family near Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza,\" agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.\nBassal said that an Israeli jet had fired three missiles at the house around midnight, adding the strike completely destroyed the three-storey structure.\nMore than 50 people were residing in the house, he said, with many still under the rubble.\n\"Rescuers were unable to evacuate the martyrs or the wounded until this morning,\" said Jaber Alian, 30, who witnessed the strike from a house near the hospital.\nHe told AFP there were several other bombings across the northern parts of the territory during the night.\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about the strike on the Tarabish home.\nFor several weeks, the Israeli military has been engaged in a sweeping operation in northern Gaza, which it says is aimed at preventing the regrouping of Hamas militants in the area.\nIn another strike in central Gaza on Wednesday morning, at least seven people were killed when an Israeli warplane struck the house of the Al-Bayoumi family in Nuseirat refugee camp, Bassal said.\nThe military, meanwhile, said two projectiles crossed from central Gaza into Israel on Wednesday, but were intercepted by the air force.\nThe war in Gaza broke out after Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7 last year, resulting in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\nThe count includes hostages who died or were killed while being held in Gaza after they were seized by Palestinian militants during the attack.\nMilitants abducted 251 hostages, 96 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 44,786 people, a majority of them civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run health ministry that is considered reliable by the UN.\n"},{"hash":"de8873cacfc269ed323efc641162536baa2455fcfc17ae9f906663f8aa215599","title":"trump-says-solving-ukraine-crisis-his-top-priority","date":1733875200000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/trump-says-solving-ukraine-crisis-his-top-priority","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/trump1633224420_1024.jpeg","category":"global","content":"\n

They clicked photos and selfies for a few minutes and returned to Kathmandu.The group spent nearly Rs16.20 million on chopper reservations, excluding other expenses such as hotels, transport, and national park fees, which could be worth millions of dollars.“They were high-end visitors to Nepal, who had money but no time,” said Anil Manandhar, corporate manager of Shree Airlines, Nepal’s largest helicopter operator. “As high-end tourism contributes to the long-term economic welfare of destinations, the government must know how to promote them.”But on Wednesday, chopper operators received a big jolt—beyond their imagination.From January 1, choppers will be barred from conducting sightseeing tours in the Everest region.The Sagarmatha National Park, which hosts Mt Everest, issued a circular informing all helicopter companies that they can no longer operate sightseeing flights in the national park.“We are taking this unpopular decision to provide justice to wildlife,” said Sushma Rana, senior conservation officer of the park, which has headquarters at Namche Bazaar. Helicopters have also been banned from transporting cargo above Pangboche at 3,985 metres above sea level.“The rule, however, will not apply to rescue flights,” said Rana.The park was established on July 19, 1976, and covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural phenomena and unique culture, the park was included on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. “The chopper-ban is a very strange decision that will deal a huge blow to high-end tourism,” said Manandhar. Already, there are restrictions. From Kathmandu, helicopters can carry four passengers in a light and medium helicopter up to Lukla. From Lukla, the chopper can take only two passengers to Kala Patthar. Choppers are restricted from landing at the Everest base camp but can make an overfly.So, the tour operator’s itinerary usually includes the Kathmandu-Lukla-Kala Patthar flight. From there, tourists take lunch at Everest View Hotel in Syangboche and fly back.Revenue-wise, a tourist pays around Rs10,000 under different categories: Rs3,000 for park conservation, Rs2,000 for village development, and Rs900 for airport. Separately, helicopters pay Rs3,000 for each landing and parking.“The Everest sightseeing tour is Nepal’s premium product, which we have not marketed well. It can bring high-end tourists from around the world,” said Manandhar. In the peak season, there are 8-10 such flights. On Thursday, operators held an emergency meeting with the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the civil aviation regulator. The Airlines Operators’ Association of Nepal said it would only honour the regulator's decision. Issuing a press statement on Thursday evening, the association said it would not abide by the decision made by the national park as the civil aviation regulator has the sole authority to ban flights. The association, the umbrella body of the airline companies, said it would continue flights.The national park has many complaints about helicopter companies that prompted it to make such a drastic decision.Rana said they analysed three significant factors, which ultimately resulted in such an unpopular move. First, excessive noise pollution. The noise pollution in the wildlife habitat has resulted in behavioural changes in the local animals. “The sounds can cause wild animals to leave their habitat and run into the villages. Our studies show that accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising,” Rana said. The shy natural goral is found foraging and sheltering in rocky faces of mountains.“The animals jump off the cliffs in shock when choppers fly at low altitudes with big sounds. Their death cases are rising. We are doing justice to the wild animals by stopping commercial flights above the national park.”Second, according to Rana, the park has long warned helicopters to stop haphazard landings. “But no one has abided by this decision. Besides, we suspect the smuggling of wildlife contraband,” said Rana.“If helicopters ignore landing in the designated areas, we obviously cannot monitor them all. This gives us room to suspect that they are involved in smuggling.”Third, the locals say the rise in heli tours has cut their jobs. Usually, it takes 14 days for trekkers to reach Everest base camp. But most of them return by helicopter. “So chopper ride has cut jobs of porters and guides, and also affected businesses of tea houses and resorts in the Everest region,” said Rana.The park alone did not decide to ban sightseeing. Multiple stakeholders, including the local government and the local people, are involved. The Nepal Army and local youth groups have been tasked with monitoring the ban.This is not the first time the park tried to ban sightseeing flights.In October, the park office in Namche wrote to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal in Lukla, requesting a ban on helicopter flights for commercial purposes over the national park. Tour operators say that honest chopper companies have been made to suffer due to the wrongdoings of a few unethical ones that breach rules for “quick profit”. “And now authorities have imposed a blanket ban,” complained a top official of a helicopter company. In 2018, Nepal ordered a review of helicopter rescues after uncovering a multimillion-dollar scam in which climbers were pressured to take costly flights down mountains, sometimes by spiking their food. Unscrupulous operators pocketed thousands of dollars from insurance companies by making multiple claims for a single chopper ride or pushing trekkers to agree to airlifts for minor illnesses.Scammers can charge thousands of dollars for a helicopter rescue.According to Rana, the conservation officer, more than 6,000 choppers fly above the national park in the spring and autumn seasons. Rescue flights for tourists and trekkers will still be allowed. However, they, too, must secure recommendation letters from nearby health institutions, buffer zone committees, or ward offices. According to operators, rescue operations were already lengthy. “Now, the process could be impossible to complete.” These flights must be approved by the park office, and detailed records of the individuals to be rescued must be submitted. According to the new rule, the rescue chopper should be fully equipped, and the patient should be treated at Pasang Lhamu-Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla.

Rangers from the Central Zoo, who were informed about the common leopard entering the human settlement, captured the beast.“The leopard was seriously ailing and had also developed problems with the nervous system,” said Dr Amir Sadaula, a veterinary officer at the National Trust for Nature Conservation, Chitwan. “It did not survive even though we started treatment immediately following the rescue. Test results show the leopard was infected with canine distemper virus.”Canine distemper is a highly contagious and serious viral disease caused by the canine distemper virus. The virus affects several body systems in dogs, including the central nervous system, spinal cord, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract. The virus does not affect humans.Sadaula said that the deadly virus might have been passed to leopards from infected dogs. Incidents of leopards getting infected from canine distemper have increased recently, mainly in the suburban areas. “At least four leopards, which were rescued from settlements in Kathmandu, Dolakha, Parbat and Palpa, were found infected with canine distemper virus,” said Sadaula. “We carried out lab testing on the samples of those rescued leopards in the laboratory of the National Trust for Nature Conservation, Chitwan.”Officials say that three sub-lineages of the virus have been detected in four leopards. They attributed that sub-lineage of the virus, which killed leopards in Kathmandu and Dolakha, was similar and could have been transmitted from dogs. However, the sub-lineages in the leopards from Palpa and Parbat were different, which indicates they were transmitted from wild animals.Along with domestic dogs, wild dogs, foxes, and other wild animals could become infected with the canine distemper virus. Experts express grave concerns about the rising deaths of wild animals from the infection of canine distemper virus, whose fatality rate is too high (above 50 percent). Earlier, elephants were infected with tuberculosis transmitted from humans.Leopards, searching for food, often enter human settlements to prey upon dogs. They get infected and die of the infection of the deadly virus if their prey is already infected.Experts say that tigers, like leopards, could become infected with deadly diseases if dog infections are not prevented, which can lead to serious disasters.“India and Indonesia have already reported canine distemper virus infection in lions and leopards,” said Sadaula. “Russia has reported infections on Amur tigers. If we fail to break the transmission chain, our tiger can also get infected.”Experts say the only way to prevent cross-transmission is to vaccinate dogs in buffer zones. The disease's symptoms are similar to rabies, as infected dogs exhibit nasal and eye discharge, fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, seizures, or muscle tremors that can also lead to death.Officials say the infected dogs die within two weeks. Doctors say the world could witness a new pandemic at any time as new diseases are being passed to humans from animals.  ","summary":"A few years ago, locals from Halchowk, Kathmandu, saw a common leopard wandering in broad daylight in their vicinity.

KP Sharma Oli, the current Prime Minister and chair of the CPN-UML, retracted the proposal to transport liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs) from India to Chitwan during his previous premiership in 2020, claiming that the country is working to increase hydropower capacity as an alternative to cooking gases. Yet, the same party’s Minister for Industry, Damodar Bhandari, recently visited New Delhi to discuss a gas pipeline project. Although Nepal initially requested the LPG pipeline project (from Motihari in India to Sarlahi in Nepal) to be built with a grant from its southern neighbour, insiders are sceptical that such an ambitious undertaking can be hard without a long-term agreement. Such actions show that we as a country are nowhere close to prioritising green energy. On paper, Nepal plans to produce more than 28,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 as part of its green, renewable energy ambition. But, in practice, it is desperately lobbying for a multi-million dollar cross-border LPG pipeline project with India, supporting a continued reliance on imported fossil fuels. What our policymakers seem to be ignoring are the risks fossil fuels pose to the environment and the setbacks they cause to the overall development of hydropower in the country. Evidently, reducing the reliance on LPGs would save the country more than Rs50 billion—which was spent on importing cooking gas in the last fiscal year—which in turn would also make a big dent in the country’s ever-rising trade deficit. Moreover, compared to the LPG, electricity-powered stoves are more sustainable, environmentally friendly and cost-effective. But rather than cut their supply and imports in the country, policymakers are looking for ways to make them easily and widely available. The pouring of billions into the gas project will make the path for the establishment of additional hydropower projects in the country more difficult. Despite having the potential to produce 40,000 megawatts, the country currently generates just around 3,000 megawatts. So experts warn that the hydropower potential is at risk of being undermined by the government’s investment in fossil fuel infrastructure. At present, 44.3 percent of households in the country rely on LPG for cooking, and only 0.5 percent use electricity for the purpose, despite a surplus of hydroelectricity even during off-peak seasons. The government will require $25 billion to meet its target of replacing 25 percent of LPGs with electric stoves by 2030. Nepal is also looking to install 500,000 improved cooking stoves with a focus on rural areas. These green goals, unfortunately, are bound to get sidelined due to the LPG pipeline project. It is not that the electric cooking vision doesn’t have challenges. There are issues of frequent power cuts and low voltages. Similarly, even though Nepal’s national grid has expanded to almost 95 percent of the country’s households, five percent are still left in the lurch. This again highlights the need to ensure uninterrupted electricity for all. It is high time the government gave up the temptation of short-term LPG gains and aligned its strategies with the vision of making electric stoves one of the primary cooking methods by 2030. The country’s energy security and environment are not the things that the government can take lightly.  ","summary":"Nepal’s contradictory energy policies expose the hollow rhetoric of our top political leaders.

With AI algorithms increasingly dictating content and influencing societal perspectives, misinformation and disinformation have become rampant. The monetisation of many social media platforms has led to the production and circulation of viral content, regardless of their credibility and accuracy. So, professional journalism’s need to act as a firewall against fake news, deepfakes, context-free information and other forms of misleading content has become more crucial. Journalism is one of the most essential professions for maintaining public trust, particularly in developing nations like ours with low media and information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. The foundational principles of journalism—truth, transparency, accountability, information verification and ethical reporting—must be the guiding tenets for an informed society in the age of AI.Misinformation in the digital landscapeSeveral social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube and X, have been criticised for their role in rapidly disseminating misinformation, disinformation and propaganda, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, misinformation on pandemic prevention methods, such as the unfounded claim that turmeric water could cure the virus, spread rapidly in Nepal and beyond. On April 26, Sidhakura.com, a Nepali news portal, published fabricated audio entitled “The Dark Files”, raising considerable concern among stakeholders on the potential misuse of AI technology. These digital platforms use algorithms that optimise user engagement, often prioritising sensational and polarising content over factual accuracy. Concurrently, generative AI’s advent has disrupted media practices and altered journalistic gatekeeping processes.Generative AI has become one of the most deceptive threats to journalism since we wholeheartedly accept its outputs. This is called technological somnambulism, a philosophical concept that illustrates our tendency to be unaware of how technology is changing the conditions of human existence. These fake, hyper-realistic audiovisuals have been exploited to manipulate public opinion, tarnish reputations and interfere with electoral processes. In March 2022, shortly after the Russia-Ukraine war began, Russian agents produced a deepfake video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, allegedly ordering his troops to surrender to the Russian army. In June, the White House administration reported that President Joe Biden had fallen victim to a deepfake video. Biden admitted in a press conference that he could not recognise a deepfake video of his own at first glance. These instances highlight how the rapidly advancing AI-powered tools undermine the public’s hard-won trust in established media and journalistic practices.

When employed responsibly, AI has the potential to enhance sustainable journalism, helping it thrive in an increasingly complex media landscape.  ","summary":"In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), media professionals often encounter questions about the importance of journalism. With AI algorithms increasingly dictating content and influencing societal perspectives, misinformation and disinformation have become rampant. The monetisation of many social media platforms has led to the production and circulation of viral content, regardless of their credibility and accuracy. So, professional journalism’s need to act as a firewall against fake news, deepfakes, context-free information and other forms of misleading content has become more crucial. Journalism is one of the most essential professions for maintaining public trust, particularly in developing nations like ours with low media and information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. The foundational principles of journalism—truth, transparency, accountability, information verification and ethical reporting—must be the guiding tenets for an informed society in the age of AI.Misinformation in the digital landscapeSeveral social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube and X, have been criticised for their role in rapidly disseminating misinformation, disinformation and propaganda, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, misinformation on pandemic prevention methods, such as the unfounded claim that turmeric water could cure the virus, spread rapidly in Nepal and beyond. On April 26, Sidhakura.com, a Nepali news portal, published fabricated audio entitled “The Dark Files”, raising considerable concern among stakeholders on the potential misuse of AI technology. These digital platforms use algorithms that optimise user engagement, often prioritising sensational and polarising content over factual accuracy. Concurrently, generative AI’s advent has disrupted media practices and altered journalistic gatekeeping processes.Generative AI has become one of the most deceptive threats to journalism since we wholeheartedly accept its outputs. This is called technological somnambulism, a philosophical concept that illustrates our tendency to be unaware of how technology is changing the conditions of human existence. These fake, hyper-realistic audiovisuals have been exploited to manipulate public opinion, tarnish reputations and interfere with electoral processes. In March 2022, shortly after the Russia-Ukraine war began, Russian agents produced a deepfake video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, allegedly ordering his troops to surrender to the Russian army. In June, the White House administration reported that President Joe Biden had fallen victim to a deepfake video. Biden admitted in a press conference that he could not recognise a deepfake video of his own at first glance. These instances highlight how the rapidly advancing AI-powered tools undermine the public’s hard-won trust in established media and journalistic practices. Without journalistic intervention, these manipulative tools could mislead substantial segments of the population. Investigating and verifying such claims remains vital in combating the infodemic propagated on digital platforms. So, AI tools cannot supplant the need for professional journalism in any society.

It surged to a one-year high within two weeks, and has since retained its strength against its major peers. His election has also again brought the prospect of US tariffs on imports, and attention has focused on the disruption to global trade that these may bring.As part of this, Trump made a not-so-veiled threat of steep levies on the Brics group of leading emerging markets should they create a rival to the US dollar, which has been the world’s “dominant currency” since the second world war.The use and holding of the US dollar by other countries is known as dollarisation. It has different levels of meaning, from countries like Panama using the US dollar as their currency, to its use in the pricing of major internationally traded commodities, and as a reserve and vehicle currency. This latter role enhances global trade.Take Chile and Malaysia as an example. Any trade between these two countries will involve the exchange of Chilean pesos for Malaysian ringgit, for which there is not a large and active market. So, pesos are instead exchanged for US dollars and US dollars for ringgit, allowing trade to occur in a quicker and more cost-efficient manner.Indeed, the US dollar is used in more than 50 percent of foreign trade invoices, and over 80 percent of all foreign exchange transactions worldwide. However, it is possible that Trump’s “America First” foreign policy could serve to hasten the end of the US dollar’s dominance.Pros and consDollarisation is beneficial for global trade. But it brings particular benefits to the US, as other countries need to hold US dollars to facilitate trade and pay for many commodities. This means that demand for the US dollar remains high, so it does not come under pressure to depreciate.A more important point is perhaps that when countries buy US dollars, they don’t hold them in cash. Rather, they buy US Treasury bills and so, in effect, lend money to the US government. This high demand for US Treasuries means the US government is able borrow at a cheaper rate than would otherwise be possible.However, there are also drawbacks. A strong US dollar increases the price of dollar-denominated commodities and thus the cost of international trade. And for the US itself, a strong US dollar can damage its domestic export business.These drawbacks have often led to the suggestion of a multi-currency global system, although this has never gained traction or been a serious consideration. But that could change with a second Trump presidency.During his first term, such calls grew louder. And there have been some shifts in US dollar holdings since then, to the extent that global US dollar reserves have declined.So, which Trump policies could hasten the end of US dollar dominance? The incoming president is regarded as pro-business, which will probably translate into policies aimed at lowering regulation and taxes. Stimulating domestic growth will lead to an even stronger US dollar at a time when global output is more modest.A stronger US dollar, as mentioned above, also increases the price of oil and similar commodities. Countries will inevitably ask themselves why oil from Saudi Arabia, for example, should be paid for in US dollars as those dollars become more expensive.Trump’s economic policies are likely to increase US debt, and this can reduce the value of the large US dollar reserves held around the world. According to one study, Trump’s plans could add as much as US$15 trillion (£11.7 trillion) to the nation’s debt over a decade. A fall in the value of US dollar reserves may result in some countries being less willing to hold US debt.The effect of these policies might be considered unintentional. But other policies, such as Trump’s plan for higher tariffs, are more deliberately designed.A strong US dollar damages US exports, as they become relatively expensive in local currency terms, and makes imports relatively cheap. Tariffs are a way to protect domestic producers from this international competition.However, assuming no other country retaliates, raising tariffs will serve only to further strengthen the US dollar, as fewer imports will mean less US dollars being sold in the foreign exchange market. This will, at least in part, undo the effect of the tariff policy while imposing trade costs globally.To avoid elements of this, countries could agree to use alternatives as a reserve currency and a means to pay for international commodities. The BRICS nations have mooted a separate currency, which could revolve around one or more existing currencies like the Euro or Yuan. Trump’s threats may simply speed up this search for an alternative.What would this mean for the US?Countries would then need to hold less US dollars, so would sell off their US Treasuries. The result will be a rise in the cost of debt for the US, and a fall in the value of the US dollar. Ironically, this would increase the price of imports (the goal of Trump’s tariff policy), but it could also lead to inflation.In a worst-case scenario, should countries coordinate their selling of US dollars and Treasuries, a run on the US dollar would have major implications for the US and the world. This would lead to higher debt costs in the US and a need to reduce its trade deficit.Globally, it would disrupt trade, raise transaction costs, and there would be a loss of value for any dollar-denominated assets and reserves. This would most likely culminate in a significant global recession.The US dollar will remain a global currency for the foreseeable future. But Trump’s “America First” policy, as well as the greater weaponisation of the US dollar, could lead to its relegation from being the only world currency.-The ConversationRead the full article here.

They have also questioned the transparency of the recommendation process, claiming Baral was intervening in the selection process though it falls under the rector’s jurisdiction.“What kind of meritocracy are you talking about when you are working to appoint only your people?” Biraj Aryal, Free Student Union (FSU) chairperson from Pulchowk Engineering College who is close to the UML, said in the senate meeting. He even accused Baral of resorting to media trials by accusing the UML of obstructing the appointment.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who was chairing the senate as chancellor, also sounded critical as he said the media has been manipulated to falsely claim that he had interfered in the selection process. “It is always good to maintain meritocracy in the appointment but it must be genuine. There should be no drama in the name of meritocracy,” Oli said. “There has been no interference from my side against what the media have claimed. However, I have insisted on meritocracy in the true sense. Isn't this my duty to tell the vice-chancellor so?”However, Bishnu Dhungel, FSU chairperson from Nepal Law Campus from the Maoist Centre-affiliated All Nepal National Independent Student Union (Revolutionary), came in Baral’s defence claiming those in power were attacking Baral who was appointed as the vice-chancellor fulfilling due process. “Why is the vice-chancellor being attacked in an organised manner?” he said. “He was appointed to the position on merit.”Baral is working to appoint 18 campus chiefs from various parts of the country after completing the dean’s appointment. “I am for appointing those ranked first to avoid the accusation that the second ranked, like myself, got the appointment,” said Baral.During the meeting, Oli directed the university leadership to fill the vacant dean’s position on grounds of merit by December 22. The next senate meeting has been called for that day. It will endorse the grace list for the upcoming convocation.The UML leadership has openly come against Baral saying he wants the Maoist Centre loyalists to get appointed as deans under the guise of meritocracy. Talking to Facebook on Tuesday, UML general secretary Shankar Pokharel wrote, “ Tribhuvan University's vice-chancellor, Baral, is engrossed in a plan to select the academic leadership of the university in a way that represents the political power (who appointed him to the position), all under the guise of meritocracy. He has cloaked it in the name of meritocracy. And the Maoist supporters close to him are vigorously endorsing and praising this drama.”Earlier this week, the leaders of the UML-affiliated All Nepal National Free Student Union had handed over a memorandum to Baral warning him of “negative consequences” if the appointments are made unilaterally.Like the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party has also come forward in defence of Baral. Issuing a statement on Thursday, the party’s acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claimed that some parties and their sister wings were resorting to political interference in the universities. “The Rastriya Swantantra Party has, from the time of its establishment, been advocating for the appointments in the universities based on competency and capability,” the statement reads. “Political interference in the appointment in academic institutions is an unpardonable crime.” ","summary":"The differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the appointment of deans and campus chiefs was reflected even in the senate meeting of the Tribhuvan University on Thursday.While the Free Student Union leaders affiliated to the ruling CPN-UML criticised vice-chancellor Keshar Jung Baral’s attempt to appoint the deans and campus chiefs based on “meritocracy,” those associated with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre) defended him.Appointments of deans at eight institutes including in the medicine and engineering has been delayed as the UML and its student leaders are opposed to Baral’s proposal of appointing those listed in the first rank among the three.Then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had in February appointed Baral as the vice-chancellor even though he was second in the number after Chitra Bahadur Budhathoki.The UML’s student leaders have claimed that Baral, who became the vice-chancellor despite being recommended in the second number, is trying to fill the vacant positions with people loyal to him in the name of appointing only those ranked the first.

Issuing a statement on Thursday, the party’s acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claimed that some parties and their sister wings were resorting to political interference in the universities. “The Rastriya Swantantra Party has, from the time of its establishment, been advocating for the appointments in the universities based on competency and capability,” the statement reads. “Political interference in the appointment in academic institutions is an unpardonable crime.” "},{"hash":"b57d6dc00081056574522c53fda09b152d340338fc17212a94e2563467376304","title":"janakpur-bolts-secure-playoff-spot-in-nepal-premier-league","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/12/12/janakpur-bolts-secure-playoff-spot-in-nepal-premier-league","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/janakpurbolts-1734001616.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733961600000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"Janakpur has become the first team to secure a place in the playoffs of the Nepal Premier League.

The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise.

Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner.

It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner.

Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  ","summary":"The US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections.

Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement.

Instead, I was drawn to non-academic books. I still remember an activity from 8th grade in our Compulsory English workbook: I had to write a poem. My English teacher praised my poem and encouraged me to write and read more. That moment sparked my interest in poetry and creative writing.I don’t recall the first book I read, but ‘Seto Bagh’ by Diamond Shumsher Rana is one of the earliest books I enjoyed. I read its English translation back then while trying to improve my English. To this day, it remains a book I recommend to everyone.What encourages you to write poems?I started writing poems for myself. It was a personal space to process and express my thoughts and emotions. I’ve performed slam poetry several times and shared some pieces on my Instagram. In fact, my first Instagram post was a poem.When I was younger, I was influenced by the poems I read and often tried to emulate their style. Over time, I feel I have developed my voice, an accumulation of the different poetry styles I’ve encountered. At various points in my life, I was reading works by BP Koirala, Sarah Kay, and Pablo Neruda, each of whom deepened my love for poetry and shaped my perspective.Although I’ve written poems only a handful of times, I want to continue exploring this creative outlet. However, there was a period when I became overly critical of my writing, which made me hesitant to share my work. On top of that, my busy work schedule interrupted my writing. Despite these setbacks, my passion for poetry remains, and I hope to return to it more consistently.What kind of books do you read? I don’t have a specific favourite book genre—it changes frequently. Over different phases of my life, I’ve explored a variety of books. During my school days, I was drawn to historical fiction and spent some time delving into books on Hindu mythology. While I read fiction in the past, my work has recently steered me toward nonfiction and leadership-related books.Since I primarily work from home without fixed hours, my work often extends throughout the day.

At a time when nothing felt certain, reading short stories became the highlight of my day.Since then, my interest in short stories has grown.

The Nepali Congress central executive committee met on Monday, while the CPN-UML held a meeting of the party's secretariat on Tuesday.The main topic of discussion in both parties' meetings was Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s recent visit to China and the agreements reached during that visit.The two parties, meanwhile, have differences over the visit and the eventual agreements, especially the framework for the BRI cooperation. The government on Tuesday made the copy of the BRI cooperation framework public.Raghubir Mahaseth, a member of the UML secretariat and head of its foreign affairs department, said that the secretariat meeting had declared the prime minister's visit as a success. “As per last week’s deal between the two countries, projects would be implemented either through grants, loans or joint investment,” Mahaseth said. But the Congress meeting insisted that Nepal cannot and should not accept loans to fund BRI projects, according to joint secretary of the party, Jeevan Pariyar.“It has been our official stance that Nepal should not take loans to fund BRI projects. Our party understands the phrasing ‘Aid Assistance Financing’ in the BRI framework to mean that the country will take only grants,” Pariyar told the Post. Prime Minister Oli, however, has said that it can be either a loan or a grant. “BRI funding can be a loan, a grant, or joint investment,\" Oli said in Birtamod, Jhapa on Monday. “Some people are shouting without understanding what BRI actually means.” “If the BRI framework involves loans as well, why did the prime minister lie at a press conference at Kathmandu airport after returning from China, when he said there was no agreement to take loans?” questioned Congress joint general secretary Pariyar.The Congress calling for developing BRI projects under grants does not mean the party is against cooperation with China, Pariyar said.Congress former general secretary and influential leader Krishna Prasad Sitaula also says that the party’s decision on Monday on the financial modality for BRI projects is official. When asked whether the two ruling parties’ differing understandings of the funding method for BRI projects will affect government functioning, Sitaula denied such a possibility.“Even if the two parties have different views on the BRI financing modality there should be no difficulty in cooperation,” Situla told the Post. Mahaseth echoes Situala. The agreement was done in presence of leaders from both the parties so it should not attract any confusion, Mahaseth said. “For us, the only thing that matters is the opinion of the establishment wing of the Congress,” says UML publicity department chief Rajendra Gautam. Gautam says that what other Congress leaders say on the issue is not so important, given that the establishment wing of the Congress has already welcomed the agreement on BRI cooperation.“Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba himself has endorsed the agreement between Nepal and China under the framework for BRI cooperation,” Gautam said. “To manage the political camps in the party, they might be saying different things, but that does not carry any importance.”Again, there is no particular reason to oppose the agreement between the two countries since the agreement was done as per the blueprint prepared by a Congress-UML task force, Gautam stressed. Also, the agreement was inked in presence of Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba who is also a leader of Congress, Gautam said. Not only on the issue of BRI, the Congress also appears to be dissatisfied with other agreements reached during the Prime Minister Oli’s visit to China and some of the points made in the joint statement.Govindaraj Pokharel, Congress leader close to Shekhar Koirala and a former chair of the National Planning Commission, gave a few reasons suggesting that Nepal has deviated from the conventional foreign policy of the country which is non-alliance and the Panchsheel.Nepal used the Chinese name Xizang for Tibet and by agreeing to firmly support China’s effort to reunite Taiwan into mainland China, Nepal deviated from its foreign policy, Pokharel argued. Head of Foreign Affairs Department of UML, Mahaseth challenges Pokharel saying, “The agreement done during Prime Minister’s China visit aligns with the foreign policy of the country.”Nepal has been a staunch supporter of One China and the agreement has not deviated from it, Mahaseth added.“Being the signature party on the framework for the BRI cooperation under the ‘Aid Assistance Financing’, the Congress in future only can raise questions on the terms and conditions of the financial assistance, but it has to abide by the agreement. So supporting the document was a mistake by the party,” says Pokharel.The coalition government of Congress and UML has agreed to take soft loan, grant and technical assistance for the projects of Nepal’s interest under the BRI. Despite the party's official decision not to take loan, what made party members agree on the ‘Technical support and Aid Financing Modality’?” questioned Pokharel.Pokharel also hinted that the issue of agreement reached would stir up controversy in the party.  ","summary":"Nepal’s two largest and ruling parties were busy in internal meetings in the past few days.

Congress, often dubbed the country’s grand old party, held its 14th general convention in mid-December 2021, and should hold the next convention by mid-December 2025 as per the party statute. If the party is to hold its general convention a year later, it should have started the convention-related activities by now but it hasn’t, says a leader.Krishna Paudel, the party office’s chief secretary, said Congress needs to resolve issues related to active party membership before starting the process of the convention.Of the total 165 federal electoral constituencies, the issues of active party membership have been resolved only in the Kathmandu-4 constituency, according to party leaders.“Apart from this, the Congress needs to amend its statute to address various challenges the party is facing in the changing context and for that, the party will soon form a statute amendment committee,” Paudel said. “Despite pressure from a section to hold the general convention by the end of next year, the party is unlikely to do so.”The party statute gives each elected body a four-year tenure. However, the party charter provisions a one-year extension if the general convention cannot take place within four years. Further, Nepal’s constitution also envisions that political parties hold their conventions every five years. Article 269 (4) (b) of the constitution requires a political party to hold its general convention at least once every five years. In special circumstances, the constitution allows the event to be postponed for six months citing a valid reason.Congress leadership went for maximum extension allowed by the statute before holding the last general convention. Fearing that President Sher Bahadur Deuba could repeat the same situation, the Koirala-led faction plans to compel the party establishment to adhere to the party charter’s four-year gap between the two conventions as there is no crisis barring the party from holding the event.During the Mahasamiti meeting held in February, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the party, presented his organisational paper and proposed concluding the conventions of lower party committees by the end of November (last month). Under the plan, conventions of the ward units should have been held by the end of November, and conventions of village and city committees should have been held by the middle of this month.Thapa at the Mahasamiti meeting had proposed concluding the party’s all district conventions by mid-September 2025, provincial conventions by mid-November, and the general convention by mid-December 2025. The Congress chooses its leadership from the ward level to the centre through the conventions. The party conducts four tiers of direct elections. And general convention delegates are elected by and from among them.The organisational paper presented by the general secretary was endorsed by the Mahasamiti meeting, provided that it could also be amended by the central committee meeting. The subsequent central committee meeting of the party held in August also passed the paper presented by Thapa.Nevertheless, none of the party’s general convention-related activities have started in the lower units as per the schedule.Mahalaxmi Upadhyaya, a joint general secretary of the Congress, says that despite the party statute mentioning holding the general convention within four years, party history suggests that it gets extended at least by one year in accordance with the party charter.Several Congress leaders said that Deuba wouldn’t convene the general convention before taking charge of the government as per his deal with the CPN-UML.As per the Congress-UML agreement reached while forming the two-party government in July, Congress President Deuba will become prime minister after two years of signing the two-party deal.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli upon his arrival from the China visit on December 5 said that he would hand over the government leadership to Deuba after 18 months. If Congress follows the party statute to hold the general convention, it should take place just after a year, but Deuba will get the reins of government only 18 months later.Citing that, many Congress leaders said that Deuba will not hold the party's general convention without first taking charge of the government.“Since Deuba already has announced he won’t be in the race for the party's top position, becoming prime minister after relinquishing the post of party president might be difficult,” said a party leader.He may feel that his prospect of becoming prime minister as per the understanding with the UML might be in risk once a new leader elected from the convention heads the party, the leaders said.In the last general convention held in 2021 when Deuba and Koirala were contesting for the post of party president after the first round remained indecisive, Deuba while seeking the vote in the runoff had requested votes from the delegates saying his position of prime minister may not continue should he not remain the party chief.So Deuba will try to take the government reins before conducting the party convention, leaders say.Upadhyaya, however, differs.“The convention may not take place next year because no substantive preparation has yet begun,” she said, “not because his premiership will be challenged for not being the party chief.” ","summary":"A year before the scheduled 15th general convention of the Nepali Congress, leaders from the party’s dissident faction have started exerting pressure on the leadership to hold the event on time.Shekhar Koirala, the Congress’s dissident faction leader, convened a gathering of chiefs of the party’s local units on December 3 in his hometown Biratnagar, demanding that the 15th general convention be held by mid-December next year.Addressing the gathering, he urged all the participants to start a pressure campaign for a timely convention from each of the local units they lead. “The longer the period the general convention is deferred, the weaker the party will become,” he said.On various occasions of late, Koirala has been consistently demanding that the party hold the convention as stipulated in the party statute.However, several party leaders the Post talked to see no chance of the party holding its national gathering on time.

The Congress chooses its leadership from the ward level to the centre through the conventions. The party conducts four tiers of direct elections. And general convention delegates are elected by and from among them.The organisational paper presented by the general secretary was endorsed by the Mahasamiti meeting, provided that it could also be amended by the central committee meeting. The subsequent central committee meeting of the party held in August also passed the paper presented by Thapa.Nevertheless, none of the party’s general convention-related activities have started in the lower units as per the schedule.Mahalaxmi Upadhyaya, a joint general secretary of the Congress, says that despite the party statute mentioning holding the general convention within four years, party history suggests that it gets extended at least by one year in accordance with the party charter.Several Congress leaders said that Deuba wouldn’t convene the general convention before taking charge of the government as per his deal with the CPN-UML.As per the Congress-UML agreement reached while forming the two-party government in July, Congress President Deuba will become prime minister after two years of signing the two-party deal.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli upon his arrival from the China visit on December 5 said that he would hand over the government leadership to Deuba after 18 months. If Congress follows the party statute to hold the general convention, it should take place just after a year, but Deuba will get the reins of government only 18 months later.Citing that, many Congress leaders said that Deuba will not hold the party's general convention without first taking charge of the government.“Since Deuba already has announced he won’t be in the race for the party's top position, becoming prime minister after relinquishing the post of party president might be difficult,” said a party leader.He may feel that his prospect of becoming prime minister as per the understanding with the UML might be in risk once a new leader elected from the convention heads the party, the leaders said.In the last general convention held in 2021 when Deuba and Koirala were contesting for the post of party president after the first round remained indecisive, Deuba while seeking the vote in the runoff had requested votes from the delegates saying his position of prime minister may not continue should he not remain the party chief.So Deuba will try to take the government reins before conducting the party convention, leaders say.Upadhyaya, however, differs.“The convention may not take place next year because no substantive preparation has yet begun,” she said, “not because his premiership will be challenged for not being the party chief.” "},{"hash":"f7dbbc6ddffc11352824d2a3ceb0764ad413dd43d67872de5ae627ee8a4de91d","title":"rsp-chair-lamichhane-transferred-to-birgunj-for-investigation","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/09/rsp-chair-lamichhane-transferred-to-birgunj-for-investigation","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/rabi181020241123241000x0-1733743285.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733702400000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is currently in police custody under charges of cooperative frauds, organised crime, and money laundering, has been taken to Birgunj for further investigation.Lamichhane, who was arrested on October 18 from RSP’s central office in Kathmandu, was initially taken to Kaski for questioning.

Bhandari relinquished her party role as vice chair when she became the country’s first female President. According to Maoist Centre leaders, the party is also considering involving Amik Sherchan, a former provincial head, in active politics. Sherchan, however, said the party is yet to discuss the matter with him. “Whether people who have previously held constitutional positions like President, Vice President, and Provincial head can join active politics should be decided only after a vigorous debate,” Sherchan said.“You occupy the constitutional position by relinquishing party membership. So after completing your constitutional role, should you be allowed to return to the party’s fold?” Sherchan told the Post. “What precedent do we want to set? We need to consider these questions.” While Sherchan says there has been no official discussion on his return to active politics, Pun, the former Vice-president, claims that he has already rejoined his former party. According to Maoist Centre leaders, Pun has been participating in many party functions and events, and a formal announcement will soon be made. There are multiple examples of leaders returning to politics after completing their tenures in high state offices. But a Maoist Centre leader says this should not be allowed in the case of former Presidents, Vice-presidents, or even Provincial heads.“If we make such decisions, other political parties could follow suit, which may backfire for our party in the long run,” the leader said on the condition of anonymity. The leader believes such a practice should be discouraged to preserve the democratic spirit even though the constitution does not explicitly prohibit it. A section of the Maoist Centre also believes that by bringing back Pun, party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who of late has enjoyed good relations with former President Bidya Devi Bhandari, is trying to facilitate her return to the CPN-UML. “Former President Bhandari, who is trying to return to active politics, however, is facing hurdles, as her possible return came to be widely criticised, including by UML leaders,” another Maoist Centre leader said on the condition of anonymity. “Bringing back Pun, who was Vice-President when Bhandari was the President, can smoothen her way into the party politics.” If Bhandari rejoins active politics and becomes the UML head, Dahal might consider unifying the Maoist Centre and the UML, as happened in 2018. The Nepal Communist Party, born of the merger, split in 2021. However, Maoist Centre Secretary Ram Karki says when people are clamouring for new faces in politics, old faces rejoining politics will be meaningless. “Even a unification of the UML and Maoist Centre will have no impact on the communist movement, as neither party is truly communist anymore,” Karki said.Mahesh Bartaula, the UML chief whip, says it is up to the respective former President or Vice-President to make the call, as there is no constitutional bar. “That being the case, I also need no need for one former politician to facilitate the re-entry into politics of another former politician,” Bartaula said. Maoist Centre politburo member Yubraj Chaulagain denies that the party is considering bringing back Pun into active politics in order to help Bhandari. But he believes that should the party make such a decision, it could set a bad precedent. “The Maoist Centre should not make such decisions that could have long-term repercussions for the party,” Chaulagain told the Post. “Other parties could benefit from the Maoist Centre's decision by using it as a justification for similar moves that may be unpopular or controversial, but serve their own interests.”Chaulagain said there had been no such discussions in the party on the issue. Bhandari and Pun became the country’s President and Vice-President soon after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. They held their positions for almost seven years before Ram Chandra Paudel and Ram Saya Yadav, respectively, succeeded them in early 2023. Nepal’s Constitution does not explicitly bar a former head of state from engaging in active politics after leaving office. However, constitutional experts say this is a matter of moral ethics. “In other countries, former heads and deputy heads of state do not return to active politics. It is a question of ethics,” Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general, said.But some Maoist leaders believe Dahal is trying to bring Pun into active politics to strengthen his own position in the party. Deputy general secretaries Barshaman Pun and Janardan Sharma, who used to be stalwarts of Dahal, have now become harsh critics of the party leader. They even questioned Dahal's working style and raised the issue of leadership transfer within the party. Maoist Centre chair Dahal has long been navigating internal conflicts, using strategic manoeuvres to maintain control. Earlier, he played rivals Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya against each other. When Bahattrai and Baidya left the party, Dahal played Barshaman and Janardhan against each other, but this too did not last. During the party’s standing committee meeting in August, deputy general secretary Barshaman and Janardhan stood against the party chair. A Maoist leader said that to counter the growing challenge within the party, Dahal is considering giving former Vice-preisdent Pun an important role. The possibility is that former vice-president Pun will be given the role of senior-vice-president, said the leader. “Chairman Dahal does not want to lose the majority in the party. He is trying to gain control in various ways, including by bringing back Pun and Amik Sherchan,” another party leader said on the condition of anonymity.  ","summary":"As the CPN (Maoist Centre) gears up to bring Nanda Bahadur Pun, Nepal’s two-term former Vice-president, into active party politics, the move has reignited the longstanding debate over whether former Presidents and Vice Presidents should rejoin politics.Earlier, former President Bidya Devi Bhandari was said to be considering returning to active politics, but this has yet to materialise.

According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 952 people killed themselves by consuming poison in the fiscal year 2023-24. “Poison is easily available in every household in rural areas across the country, as farmers often keep it in the house to use in crops,” said Dr Dilli Ram Sharma, former director general at the Department of Agriculture. “These hazardous substances are easily available in agri-veterinary shops and are not only being used in plants but also for suicide in our country.”Earlier, in 2018, the country banned eight pesticides—carbofuran, dichlorvos, triazophos, carbaryl, benomyl, carbosulfan, dicofol, and aluminum phosphide. Following the ban, suicides by poison ingestion have dramatically declined, according to Nepal Police report.Police data show that 1,320 people died by poison ingestion in 2018-19, the year authorities banned eight pesticides commonly used for suicide. The numbers dropped to 1,136 in 2019-20; 1,276 in 2020-21; 1040 in 2021-22 and 932 in 2022-23. Sharma said that traders can sell their existing stock of banned poisonous substances for up to two years, but cannot import more.“These pesticides are so hazardous that they can cause cancer, paralysis, renal failure, heart diseases in children, and deformities in newborn babies if used for a long time,” said Sharma. “Many countries, including India, have banned these pesticides.”After the ban on aluminium phosphide in 2018, people in crisis began ingesting chlorpyrifos, which is widely available on the market. Studies show that banning highly hazardous pesticides is a cost-effective and affordable intervention to reduce suicide rates. Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates. The country witnessed an alarming rise in suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year. “Restricting access to commonly used hazardous pesticides will help reduce deaths from suicides,” said Dr Rakesh Ghimire, principal investigator of Nepal for the Center for Pesticide Suicide Prevention at the University of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom, which has been carrying out research on suicides by poison ingestion in Nepal. “Many people who are in a moment of crisis can change their minds if they do not have access to poisonous substances.”Studies show that a ban on a few highly hazardous pesticides in Bangladesh, South Korea, and Sri Lanka, among others, led to sharp reductions in overall suicide rates. Pesticides are commonly used to get rid of insects, fungi, weeds and diseases which damage plants and crops. Every year more than 1,300 metric tons of 135 types of pesticides, including insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and biopesticide, are brought into Nepal, according to the Plant Protection Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.Doctors say high levels of pesticides in fruits and vegetables cause nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dizziness and anxiety. Long-term consumption of fruits and vegetables with high levels of pesticides can lead to kidney failure, lung disease and mental health problems, and can even cause cancer. According to health experts, the consumption of such fruits and vegetables may also affect pregnant women and harm the foetus.

Since 2016, neonatal deaths have not declined, despite various measures implemented by health authorities.According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births.Doctors say feeding low-weight babies and critically ill neonates in intensive care units can significantly reduce the risk of infections. The bank collects, tests, pasteurises and stores donor milk from lactating mothers.“The milk is collected mostly from the mothers of ailing babies, who cannot breastfeed their infants admitted to the intensive care units,” said Dr Sailendra Bir Karmacharya, a senior consultant paediatrician of the hospital. “We provide milk only to infants weighing less than 1,000 grams.”According to doctors, human breast milk contains the best source of nutrition and ensures the survival and healthy growth of babies. It bolsters brain development and has lifelong benefits for both the baby and the mother.Karmacharya said that human milk helps in reducing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature babies. Officials said the hospital needs 1.5 to 2.5 litres of breast milk for babies admitted to the intensive care unit. The human milk bank collects milk directly from mothers of hospitalised babies, but it collects only surplus milk from other lactating mothers, which is then tested, pasteurised and stored at minus 40 degrees Celsius. The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. The 16th five-year periodic plan, which ends in 2029, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from 21 per 1,000 live births. The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes, including hiring staff nurses to promote exclusive breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding has the potential to prevent 13 percent of under-five deaths. Studies show that Nepal's exclusive breastfeeding rate has steadily declined over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022, exclusive breastfeeding dropped consistently from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It stated that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), compared to 12 percent of those born at home.Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is prone to contamination and increases the risk of diseases in children, according to the World Health Organisation.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to breastfeed their babies, as studies show. The report shows that the proportion of children who are bottle-fed increases with mothers’ education, rising from 12 percent among children of mothers with no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Bottle-feeding is most common in the highest wealth quintile—46 percent—and least common in the lowest wealth quintile—11 percent.Among the seven provinces of Nepal, exclusive breastfeeding rates are the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest at 11 percent in Karnali Province, 12 percent in Madhesh Province and the highest at 43 percent in Bagmati Province.Doctors recommend breastfeeding for the first two years of a baby’s life or longer, as breast milk lowers the risk of illness in children, promotes their recovery during illness, and provides important nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve "},{"hash":"db336e9fbec17ee15c97b566db292703e2695f23d824f6d983a0439ac8eaef8c","title":"high-trails-and-hearty-laughs","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2024/12/07/high-trails-and-hearty-laughs","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/lifestyle/Untitled17-1733540690.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733529600000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"One morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. ","summary":"“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

The message helped smooth the rebels advance and Sharaa - better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani - has repeated it since Assad's ouster.At the office of the Damascus governor, its walls exquisitely decorated with marquetry and stained glass, the man brought from Idlib to run affairs dismissed concerns that Syria was being moved towards an Islamic form of government.“There is no such thing as Islamic governance. After all, we are Muslims and it’s civil institutions or ministries,” said Mohammed Ghazal, a bespectacled 36-year-old civil engineer with a thick beard who was raised in the United Arab Emirates and spoke in near perfect English.“We don’t have any problem with any ethnicity and religion,” he said. “The one who made the problem was the (Assad) regime.”However, the way HTS has gone about shaping the new interim government - by bringing senior administrators from Idlib - has caused concern for some. Four opposition sources and three diplomats told Reuters they were concerned about the inclusiveness of the process so far.Bashir has said he will only remain in power until March. But HTS - which remains classified as a terrorist group by the United States, regional powerbroker Turkey and other governments - has yet to spell out key details of the transition process, including its thinking on a new constitution.Sharaa, in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, said he would dissolve the ousted regime’s security forces, close its prisons, and hunt down anyone involved in torture or killing detainees.While Syrians celebrate the fall of Assad’s brutal police state, some are voicing fears about what may come.Wissam Bashir, 28, speaking at a Damascus cafe, expressed concern “because of the things that I’m seeing ... such as the new government, the spread of Islamic flags.”When he took office this week, Prime Minister Bashir appeared with two flags behind him - the green, black and white flag flown by opponents of Assad throughout the civil war, and a white flag with the Islamic oath of faith in black writing, typically flown in Syria by Sunni Islamist fighters.Only the Syrian national flag appeared behind him in an interview he gave to Al Jazeera on Wednesday.Zakaria Malahifji, secretary general of the Syrian National Movement who once served as political advisor to rebels in Aleppo, said the lack of consultation in forming an interim government was a misstep.“You are bringing (ministers) from one colour, there should be participation of others,” he said. “Syrian society is diverse in terms of cultures, ethnicities, so frankly this is concerning,” he said.‘Ruins, Ruins, Ruins’Like other members of the HTS-affiliated Salvation Government in Idlib brought to Damascus to run state bodies, Ghazal said he had given assurances to employees and urged them to return to work. “It’s a collapsed state. It's ruins, ruins, ruins,” Ghazal said.His priorities for the next three months are getting basic services running and streamlining the bureaucracy. Salaries, which average some $25 a month, would be increased in line with Salvation Government wages. Its minimum wage is $100 a month.“Syria is a very rich country,” said Ghazal, asked how this would be financed. “The regime used to steal the money.”Policemen brought from Idlib are directing traffic in Damascus, trying to restore some normalcy since HTS ordered armed groups out of the city. One officer, who did not give his name, said they were stretched thin, noting they previously just had to patrol Idlib.Though HTS is pre-eminent among the factions which fought Assad, others remain armed, notably in areas at the borders with Jordan and Turkey.During the war, rebel factions often clashed with each, leaving a legacy of rivalries and enmity seen as one of many risks to stability in post-Assad Syria.Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said HTS “clearly is seeking to maintain the momentum on all levels”, adding that any group in their position, taking over from a collapsed regime in an exhausted country, would behave broadly the same way.“There are multiple risks with HTS setting priorities and the pace for what comes next. One of these is to establish a new form of authoritarian rule, this time in Islamic garb,” he said.But he assessed the diversity of Syria’s opposition and society would make it difficult for one group to monopolize influence.Turkey - an influential backer of the opposition - was also keen for a government that could win international backing, he said.‘We Will Only Stay Until March’An opposition source familiar with HTS consultations said all of Syria’s sects would have representation in a caretaker government. Issues to be determined in the next three months included whether Syria should have a presidential or parliamentary system of government, the source said.The Syrian revolt spiralled out of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings that toppled autocrats in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Yemen, giving rise to turbulent and often violent periods of transition.In an interview with Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera published on Wednesday, Prime Minister Bashir said “we will only stay until March 2025.”The priorities, he said, were restoring security and state authority, bringing home millions of Syrian refugees, and providing essential services.Asked whether Syria's new constitution would be Islamic, he said “these details” would be clarified in the constitution-making process.Mohammed Alaa Ghanem, a leading Syrian activist based in Washington and in touch with senior opposition figures, said HTS was being urged to “be smart and get the transition right, instead of letting the moment go to their heads by completely dominating the new government.”The Biden administration has urged HTS not to assume automatic leadership of Syria but instead run an inclusive process to form a transitional government, according to two US officials and a congressional aide briefed on the first US contacts with the group.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the transition in Syria should lead to “credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance” consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 2254.That resolution, approved in 2015, calls for a Syrian-led process facilitated by the United Nations, establishing within six months non-sectarian governance and setting a schedule for a process of drafting a new constitution.It also calls for free and fair elections.One diplomat in Damascus said HTS is the only faction meeting with foreign missions. “We are concerned - where are all the heads of the political opposition,” the diplomat said. “It would be a major signal to have them here, and they are not here.”A second diplomat said HTS had conveyed good messages to the public but the degree of inclusiveness displayed in recent days was disturbing. Constitutional reform, in particular, must be an inclusive process and would be a really big test.The diplomat noted the presence of many other factions which have yet to disarm or demobilise as a potentially destabilising factor if an inclusive process does not take place.Joshua Landis, a Syria expert and head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said Sharaa “must assert authority quickly to stop a decent into chaos.”“But he must also try to scale up his administrative capacity by bringing in technocrats and representatives of the diverse communities,” he said.

Its minimum wage is $100 a month.“Syria is a very rich country,” said Ghazal, asked how this would be financed. “The regime used to steal the money.”Policemen brought from Idlib are directing traffic in Damascus, trying to restore some normalcy since HTS ordered armed groups out of the city. One officer, who did not give his name, said they were stretched thin, noting they previously just had to patrol Idlib.Though HTS is pre-eminent among the factions which fought Assad, others remain armed, notably in areas at the borders with Jordan and Turkey.During the war, rebel factions often clashed with each, leaving a legacy of rivalries and enmity seen as one of many risks to stability in post-Assad Syria.Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said HTS “clearly is seeking to maintain the momentum on all levels”, adding that any group in their position, taking over from a collapsed regime in an exhausted country, would behave broadly the same way.“There are multiple risks with HTS setting priorities and the pace for what comes next. One of these is to establish a new form of authoritarian rule, this time in Islamic garb,” he said.But he assessed the diversity of Syria’s opposition and society would make it difficult for one group to monopolize influence.Turkey - an influential backer of the opposition - was also keen for a government that could win international backing, he said.‘We Will Only Stay Until March’An opposition source familiar with HTS consultations said all of Syria’s sects would have representation in a caretaker government. Issues to be determined in the next three months included whether Syria should have a presidential or parliamentary system of government, the source said.The Syrian revolt spiralled out of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings that toppled autocrats in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Yemen, giving rise to turbulent and often violent periods of transition.In an interview with Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera published on Wednesday, Prime Minister Bashir said “we will only stay until March 2025.”The priorities, he said, were restoring security and state authority, bringing home millions of Syrian refugees, and providing essential services.Asked whether Syria's new constitution would be Islamic, he said “these details” would be clarified in the constitution-making process.Mohammed Alaa Ghanem, a leading Syrian activist based in Washington and in touch with senior opposition figures, said HTS was being urged to “be smart and get the transition right, instead of letting the moment go to their heads by completely dominating the new government.”The Biden administration has urged HTS not to assume automatic leadership of Syria but instead run an inclusive process to form a transitional government, according to two US officials and a congressional aide briefed on the first US contacts with the group.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the transition in Syria should lead to “credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance” consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 2254.That resolution, approved in 2015, calls for a Syrian-led process facilitated by the United Nations, establishing within six months non-sectarian governance and setting a schedule for a process of drafting a new constitution.It also calls for free and fair elections.One diplomat in Damascus said HTS is the only faction meeting with foreign missions. “We are concerned - where are all the heads of the political opposition,” the diplomat said. “It would be a major signal to have them here, and they are not here.”A second diplomat said HTS had conveyed good messages to the public but the degree of inclusiveness displayed in recent days was disturbing. Constitutional reform, in particular, must be an inclusive process and would be a really big test.The diplomat noted the presence of many other factions which have yet to disarm or demobilise as a potentially destabilising factor if an inclusive process does not take place.Joshua Landis, a Syria expert and head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said Sharaa “must assert authority quickly to stop a decent into chaos.”“But he must also try to scale up his administrative capacity by bringing in technocrats and representatives of the diverse communities,” he said.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” ","summary":"Chaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

The portfolio has recorded a remarkable 20 percent Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)—average yearly growth—over the last 15 years. Despite such expansion, the restricted flow of money to growth sectors is not primarily due to the unavailability of funds but rather due to inherent risk in high growth sectors (energy, technology), limited management bandwidth of fund providers, limited access and usage of risk management tools and/or the inability of fund providers to innovate on structures and instruments.Role of guaranteesTo mitigate such a financing gap and mobilise available credit, the Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) has been popular in developing countries to support MSMEs in obtaining loans. According to the World Bank, a public CGS is a government-or international organisation-backed financial mechanism that helps enterprises access credit and spur growth in selective sectors. Guarantees are not new to the investment realm. Governments and development partners use them to either crowd in investments or incentivise investment flow to riskier sectors. They catalyse investment in underdeveloped sectors by mitigating various risks (commercial, credit and political), thereby altering the risk-return profile for investors. Such schemes operate through intermediaries like banks, microfinance and non-bank financial institutions. The Government of Nepal set up the Deposit and Credit Guarantee Scheme (DCGF) in 2010, which regarded facilitating credit guarantees as a key objective. However, over the years, instead of spurring credit growth, this profitable agency has only become a tool for BFIs to avail of provisioning discounts (lower loan loss provisions as directed by NRB) on sector-specific credit portfolios. As per the DCGF annual report for the fiscal year 2079-80, despite a large SME credit guaranteed amount (Rs13.3 billion), the collected guarantee fees were comparatively low (Rs76.6 million), highlighting that low fees should have incentivised BFIs to participate and utilise the credit guarantee service to safeguard their assets. However, the amount paid in claims was low, Rs1.8 million, hinting at a possibility that the process to avail claims was excessively bureaucratic and excruciating. The premium rate set at 0.6 percent per annum is considered fair or modest compared to global markets. The underutilisation and ineffectiveness of the SME Credit Guarantee programme could be due to limitations in management capacity and process bureaucracy, amongst many other variables. Nonetheless, reviving this underperforming programme and bringing a paradigm shift in credit activities is never too late. Contextual use casePopular guarantee instruments are the First Loss Default Guarantee (FLDG)—the fund provider is guaranteed by the guarantor for the defaults that are incurred in the guaranteed portfolio—and the Portfolio Guarantees—a financial instrument that helps financial institutions manage credit risk across a portfolio of assets. These guarantees facilitate BFIs to deepen their exposure to sectors such as agriculture, women-led businesses, MSMEs, or technology-enabled businesses while transferring the burden of default to the guarantor. These sectors would remain underserved if there were no bridges or support.Discussions with BFI personnel exhibit hesitance to lend to the agriculture sector due to the sector’s high (10 percent) non-performing asset (NPA), i.e., loan losses not being repaid. An FLDG with a 10 percent coverage would incentivise BFIs to look at the sector differently and even increase exposure while developing a specialisation in financing sub-sectors in agriculture over time. This would help BFIs develop specialised expertise within the agri-lending value chain. Through the support of guarantees, few banks could choose to develop proficiency and enhance their capacity to lend to agro-processing specifically. At the same time, some could specialise in the agricultural input vertical (seed/equipment) or other sub-verticals (crop/livestock production/horticulture), respectively.A contextual use case is the Credit Guarantee Facility (CGF), established by the Austria-Nepal Renewable Energy Blended Finance Facility in partnership with NMB Bank Ltd. and the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre. The CGF of EUR 750,000 was allocated for Karnali Province to facilitate finance and capacity-enhancing activities for renewable energy projects while also achieving environmental, social and gender co-benefits. The fund established a 25 percent first-loss guarantee/reserve. The guarantee fund was backed by a cash deposit into the partner bank rather than a non-funded guarantee. Investors and BFIs need help to finance heavy sectors such as technology despite reports outlining their potential. Instruments such as equity guarantees are equipped to attract international commercial investors by protecting their investments/covering return gaps, i.e., if the investment doesn’t achieve the expected return, the equity guarantee will cover the difference.Such instruments complement the existing funding offerings that Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) provide to many of the BFIs in Nepal in the form of tangible sector-directed lending mandates. Due to their intangible nature, sectors such as technology face difficulty getting regular loans. Hence, full or partial portfolio guarantee instruments facilitate and incentivise BFIs to test potentiality. For example, the Sarulla Geothermal Power Project in Indonesia leveraged a risk guarantee from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and a 20-year business viability guarantee letter from the Indonesian government to crowd commercial funding.Way forwardVarious DFIs, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), aid agencies and specialised guarantee providers provide guarantees like UKaid's Sakchyam partial loan guarantee scheme for MSMEs and the Micro Hydro debt fund supported by GIZ. However, their use in Nepal has been limited and remains at the pilot stage without broader adoption. Guarantees in Nepal face multiple challenges, and complex structures require expertise that is not widely available. There needs to be more awareness about pricing these guarantees. According to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), guarantees have been more effective in mobilising private finance than any other financial instrument. Given the current economic situation, characterised by Fitch's BB- sovereign rating, business stagnation and excess liquidity, there is an untapped potential for guarantees in Nepal.

Article 59(1) of the Constitution grants these governments the authority to draft laws, prepare annual budgets and formulate and implement plans and policies. This constitutional provision is operationalised through various laws, including the Financial Procedures and Fiscal Accountability Act, 2076 (2019).These steps form the foundation for preparing the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and the annual budget. The MTEF provision, among other fiscal rules, is also reflected in the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act, 2074 (2017). This law serves as a powerful policy tool for institutionalising fiscal federalism.The National Planning Commission plays a critical role in the budgeting process. The national resource estimate committee, chaired by the vice-chairperson of the NPC and including high-level officials such as the finance secretary and the governor of the Nepal Rastra Bank, is tasked with estimating national resources available for the federal, provincial and local governments over the next three fiscal years. This estimation is based on projected investments and financial needs outlined in periodic plans, considering national and international commitments, priorities and goals such as poverty reduction and job creation.Within the approved resource and expenditure limits, the NPC provides budget ceilings and the MTEF framework to ministries and agencies by the end of Magh (mid-February). These frameworks include guidelines and formats for drafting budgets for the next three fiscal years. Ministries and agencies must align their budget proposals with the objectives and policies outlined in periodic plans and adhere to the criteria specified in the Act. Proposals failing to meet these standards may face rejection by the NPC or the Ministry of Finance. After evaluating these proposals, the ministry prepares the final budget for the upcoming fiscal year.However, oversight and compliance within the budgeting process present notable challenges. A review of plans and programmes of various ministries, such as the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and the Ministry of Urban Development, reveals frequent non-compliance with the Government of Nepal's Allocation of Business Rules. These lapses highlight the shared responsibility of the ministries, the Ministry of Finance and the NPC in ensuring adherence to established rules and procedures.Once the budget proposal is finalised, the finance minister presents the principles, priorities and details of proposed programmes and projects to the Federal Parliament two months before the budget is formally tabled. After incorporating parliamentary feedback, the budget is presented at a joint session of the Federal Parliament on Jestha 15 (late May). Following parliamentary approval, the Ministry of Finance authorises relevant ministries or agencies to implement the approved programmes and projects.Fiscal transfers and project classifications are integral to planning and budgeting, particularly for provincial and local governments. Revenue sharing and fiscal equalisation grants for subnational governments are directly managed by the Ministry of Finance, guided by the National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission (NNRFC) recommendations. Fiscal transfers come in four forms: fiscal equalisation, conditional, special and matching grants. These transfers aim to address the significant fiscal dependency of subnational governments on the federal government, which controls over 80 percent of public revenues. The conditional grants are channelled to the subnational units through the line ministries, while the special and matching grants are managed through the NPC.Subnational units benefit from revenue-sharing mechanisms, receiving 15 percent each from nationwide collections of value-added taxes and excise duties on domestic products. Additionally, they retain 25 percent of the royalties generated within their jurisdictions. The NNRFC ensures equitable distribution of these revenues by considering population, geography and the Human Development Index. Still, equity issues remain across the provinces and local levels. Budget allocation misalignedAn analysis of the budgets of the 18 federal ministries from FY 2022-23 to FY 2024-25 reveals that allocation patterns are unscientific and marked by disparities. Notably, the budget of the Ministry of Urban Development increased significantly—by 20.3 percent in FY 2023-24 and 40 percent in FY 2024-25—exceeding the limits set by the Resource Estimate Committee, which the vice-chairperson of the NPC leads. The OPMCM, bypassing standard procedures, directly influenced this increase. Additionally, the allocations included \"pocket projects\" chosen by the members of the House of Representatives under the constituency development programme. These projects, introduced covertly, had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The distribution of budgets across ministries appears inequitable and influenced by varying levels of political clout. While influential ministries secure larger budgets, others receive minimal increases. For example, the budgets for the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health and Population—both crucial social ministries—grew by only 3.2 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, in FY 2024-25. Similarly, several ministries, including the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, witnessed budget reductions this fiscal year.Resource allocation undermines constitutional principles of federalisation. While federal ministries retain most resources, conditional grants to subnational governments remain restrictive. These grants are accompanied by rigid guidelines that limit the autonomy of subnational governments to adapt spending based on local needs. The Ministry of Urban Development allocated only 8 percent of its budget to provincial levels and 17 percent to local levels in FY 2024-25. Other ministries, such as Physical Infrastructure and Transport and Youth and Sports, allocated no resources to subnational levels in FY 2024-25.An examination of budget allocations across federal, provincial and local levels further highlights the disparities. For instance, the Ministry of Health and Population increased its share to local levels from 27 percent in FY 2022-23 to 39 percent in FY 2024-25, while its allocations to provincial levels stagnated at around 7 percent. On the other hand, ministries like Labour, Employment and Social Security and Education, Science and Technology allocated significant shares to subnational functions, with the latter allocating 69 percent of its budget to local levels in FY 2024-25. In contrast, ministries responsible for subnational functions, such as Agriculture and Livestock Development and Water Supply, allocated minimal resources to local levels.Programmes and budgets that should have been fully devolved remain under federal control, contradicting the constitutional mandate to empower subnational units. The principle of gradually reducing conditional grants has not been effectively realised. ConclusionPlanning and budgeting frameworks rooted in constitutional provisions hold immense potential to strengthen federalism. However, addressing persistent challenges like non-compliance and fiscal dependency is paramount to reforming the budget system and enhancing subnational autonomy. A robust framework emphasising effective coordination, equitable resource distribution and adherence to revised fiscal standards can foster transparency and accountability.Disparities in resource allocation across sectoral ministries reveal an urgent need for reform. Political influence continues to skew budget allocations, leaving essential ministries underfunded and undermining the principles of federalisation. A scientific approach to budget allocation must be adopted to rectify these issues, guided by equitable and needs-based criteria. Ensuring compliance with constitutional provisions and gradually reducing dependency on conditional grants are critical steps toward empowering subnational units. These reforms will not only promote balanced resource distribution but also strengthen governance at federal, provincial and local levels, enabling subnational governments to meet their responsibilities and drive sustainable development effectively.

This law serves as a powerful policy tool for institutionalising fiscal federalism.The National Planning Commission plays a critical role in the budgeting process. The national resource estimate committee, chaired by the vice-chairperson of the NPC and including high-level officials such as the finance secretary and the governor of the Nepal Rastra Bank, is tasked with estimating national resources available for the federal, provincial and local governments over the next three fiscal years. This estimation is based on projected investments and financial needs outlined in periodic plans, considering national and international commitments, priorities and goals such as poverty reduction and job creation.Within the approved resource and expenditure limits, the NPC provides budget ceilings and the MTEF framework to ministries and agencies by the end of Magh (mid-February). These frameworks include guidelines and formats for drafting budgets for the next three fiscal years. Ministries and agencies must align their budget proposals with the objectives and policies outlined in periodic plans and adhere to the criteria specified in the Act. Proposals failing to meet these standards may face rejection by the NPC or the Ministry of Finance. After evaluating these proposals, the ministry prepares the final budget for the upcoming fiscal year.However, oversight and compliance within the budgeting process present notable challenges. A review of plans and programmes of various ministries, such as the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and the Ministry of Urban Development, reveals frequent non-compliance with the Government of Nepal's Allocation of Business Rules. These lapses highlight the shared responsibility of the ministries, the Ministry of Finance and the NPC in ensuring adherence to established rules and procedures.Once the budget proposal is finalised, the finance minister presents the principles, priorities and details of proposed programmes and projects to the Federal Parliament two months before the budget is formally tabled. After incorporating parliamentary feedback, the budget is presented at a joint session of the Federal Parliament on Jestha 15 (late May). Following parliamentary approval, the Ministry of Finance authorises relevant ministries or agencies to implement the approved programmes and projects.Fiscal transfers and project classifications are integral to planning and budgeting, particularly for provincial and local governments. Revenue sharing and fiscal equalisation grants for subnational governments are directly managed by the Ministry of Finance, guided by the National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission (NNRFC) recommendations. Fiscal transfers come in four forms: fiscal equalisation, conditional, special and matching grants. These transfers aim to address the significant fiscal dependency of subnational governments on the federal government, which controls over 80 percent of public revenues. The conditional grants are channelled to the subnational units through the line ministries, while the special and matching grants are managed through the NPC.Subnational units benefit from revenue-sharing mechanisms, receiving 15 percent each from nationwide collections of value-added taxes and excise duties on domestic products. Additionally, they retain 25 percent of the royalties generated within their jurisdictions. The NNRFC ensures equitable distribution of these revenues by considering population, geography and the Human Development Index. Still, equity issues remain across the provinces and local levels. Budget allocation misalignedAn analysis of the budgets of the 18 federal ministries from FY 2022-23 to FY 2024-25 reveals that allocation patterns are unscientific and marked by disparities. Notably, the budget of the Ministry of Urban Development increased significantly—by 20.3 percent in FY 2023-24 and 40 percent in FY 2024-25—exceeding the limits set by the Resource Estimate Committee, which the vice-chairperson of the NPC leads. The OPMCM, bypassing standard procedures, directly influenced this increase. Additionally, the allocations included \"pocket projects\" chosen by the members of the House of Representatives under the constituency development programme. These projects, introduced covertly, had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The distribution of budgets across ministries appears inequitable and influenced by varying levels of political clout. While influential ministries secure larger budgets, others receive minimal increases. For example, the budgets for the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health and Population—both crucial social ministries—grew by only 3.2 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, in FY 2024-25. Similarly, several ministries, including the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, witnessed budget reductions this fiscal year.Resource allocation undermines constitutional principles of federalisation. While federal ministries retain most resources, conditional grants to subnational governments remain restrictive. These grants are accompanied by rigid guidelines that limit the autonomy of subnational governments to adapt spending based on local needs. The Ministry of Urban Development allocated only 8 percent of its budget to provincial levels and 17 percent to local levels in FY 2024-25. Other ministries, such as Physical Infrastructure and Transport and Youth and Sports, allocated no resources to subnational levels in FY 2024-25.An examination of budget allocations across federal, provincial and local levels further highlights the disparities. For instance, the Ministry of Health and Population increased its share to local levels from 27 percent in FY 2022-23 to 39 percent in FY 2024-25, while its allocations to provincial levels stagnated at around 7 percent. On the other hand, ministries like Labour, Employment and Social Security and Education, Science and Technology allocated significant shares to subnational functions, with the latter allocating 69 percent of its budget to local levels in FY 2024-25. In contrast, ministries responsible for subnational functions, such as Agriculture and Livestock Development and Water Supply, allocated minimal resources to local levels.Programmes and budgets that should have been fully devolved remain under federal control, contradicting the constitutional mandate to empower subnational units. The principle of gradually reducing conditional grants has not been effectively realised. ConclusionPlanning and budgeting frameworks rooted in constitutional provisions hold immense potential to strengthen federalism. However, addressing persistent challenges like non-compliance and fiscal dependency is paramount to reforming the budget system and enhancing subnational autonomy. A robust framework emphasising effective coordination, equitable resource distribution and adherence to revised fiscal standards can foster transparency and accountability.Disparities in resource allocation across sectoral ministries reveal an urgent need for reform. Political influence continues to skew budget allocations, leaving essential ministries underfunded and undermining the principles of federalisation. A scientific approach to budget allocation must be adopted to rectify these issues, guided by equitable and needs-based criteria. Ensuring compliance with constitutional provisions and gradually reducing dependency on conditional grants are critical steps toward empowering subnational units. These reforms will not only promote balanced resource distribution but also strengthen governance at federal, provincial and local levels, enabling subnational governments to meet their responsibilities and drive sustainable development effectively.

Instead of being a secure learning space, classrooms in quake-damaged schools have turned into places where students are in perpetual fear for their safety. Last week, the Karnali province government finally initiated the reconstruction of damaged buildings of community schools and health institutions. The decision has already come too late. The students’ lives cannot be endangered while waiting for the rebuilding to be completed. On November 3 last year, the earthquake damaged several community schools, health institutions and homes in Jajarkot, Rukum West, and Salyan districts. Many displaced families still await the promised funds under fragile, temporary huts. Some victims had to take loans even to build temporary shelters as the government’s promise of providing Rs50,000 per household for such shelters has failed to materialise.This delay in relief has claimed over three dozen lives, mainly of the elderly and children in Jajarkot and Rukum West. Children’s education in these areas was hit as well: 143 schools in Jajarkot and 192 schools in Rukum West were completely destroyed in the earthquake, according to the Social Development Ministry in Karnali. The quake partially damaged 296 school buildings in Jajarkot, 509 in Rukum West and 42 in Salyan, forcing hundreds of students to continue their education in temporary structures while they are exposed to wind, rain and cold.Such conditions only worsen the situation in a province that is barely managing to attract students to schools. According to the Ministry of Social Development, Karnali, there are fewer than 10 students each in 137 community schools in the province. The Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) 2022-23 reports that Karnali has a literacy rate of 76.6 percent, one of the lowest of the seven provinces. Due to the unavailability of teachers and the absence of quality education, many students have lost faith in local schools. Absenteeism is rampant, and many young men migrate to India for work rather than get educated. The provincial Ministry of Physical Infrastructures and Urban Development has allocated Rs500 million in the current fiscal year to reconstruct quake-damaged public buildings, including community schools and health institutions. The ministry aims to complete the reconstruction in the current fiscal year, but just monetary allocation won’t ensure results. The project recommendation committees in earthquake-affected districts had identified damaged school and health institution buildings and submitted their reports. The reconstruction could not proceed until the Provincial Council of Ministers had approved the Reconstruction of Earthquake-Damaged School and Health Institution Programme (Operation and Management) Guidelines-2024. The approval was given only last month. Delays like this are bound to cost more lives. Moreover, experts warn that the western region is at risk of a major earthquake, as it has not experienced significant tremors in over 500 years. Earthquakes are inevitable, but the scale of devastation is not. It is unacceptable that students are putting their lives at risk for education. Children in disaster-stricken areas have already endured trauma, having lost their homes and loved ones. Making them study in classrooms that are still damaged is akin to forcing them to experience the same fear all over again. Any compromise in speeding up reconstruction and allowing these children to study in a safe environment will be a criminal offence.  ","summary":"The recent news of students in Karnali returning to the quake-damaged schools a year after the 6.3 magnitude earthquake that struck Jajarkot and Rukum West districts is appalling.

These committees work to hold provincial governments accountable. Even when the assembly is not in session, the committees can continue working.

Article 193 of the Constitution of Nepal specifies that “the State Assembly may, as per its rules, form committees or special committees, as required, to manage its working procedures”. Thus, the number of thematic areas varies in each province. However, the functioning of these committees is undermined in several provinces. In Karnali, three of the four parliamentary committees—the Finance and Natural Resources Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Social Development Committee—are currently without heads. While the first committee has had no chief since April this year, the latter two have been vacant for three months. The prolonged leadership vacuum in important committees is also something that is routinely seen in other provinces. The five committees in Bagmati were at a standstill without chairpersons for more than a year since the first session of the start of the second term of the Bagmati Provincial Assembly in January 2023. The parliamentary committees in Lumbini and Sudurpaschim have been without their chairs after the formation of their respective assemblies last year.

During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  ","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects.

Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. ","summary":"Wang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives.

He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  ","summary":"Former Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy.

In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  "},{"hash":"55def31953a1e5abd2e121864ceed426fa8dfb18913327b8fdb053003f3e20ef","title":"i-hope-my-performances-can-further-ignite-nepal-s-passion-for-cricket","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/11/23/i-hope-my-performances-can-further-ignite-nepal-s-passion-for-cricket","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Untitled7-1732326269.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1732320000000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley.

A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  ","summary":"Indian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission.

So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  "},{"hash":"7143ba85ab0d17b075f485e80b602f76c8cbb27bc7e7aac30ba8e9fdd6245618","title":"today-s-weather-december-12-2024","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/weather/2024/12/12/today-s-weather-december-12-2024","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/thumb6-1729043489.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733961600000,"source":"kp","category":"weather","content":"On Thursday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy to mainly fair throughout the country.Tonight the weather will remain partly cloudy to mainly fair throughout the country.According to Met Analysis, the current weather pattern is partially influenced by the westerly winds.On Wednesday Janakpur experienced a maximum temperature of 25°C, while Jumla registered a minimum temperature of -6.5°C.
