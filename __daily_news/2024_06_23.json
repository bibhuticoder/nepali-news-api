A kind of instability has been created in Nepali diplomacy as those appointed in political quotas are recalled after every government change. As per the recent practice, half the envoys are political appointees while the rest are recommended from among career diplomats.The June 6 decision of the government to recall envoys from 11 countries and Friday’s selection of new faces has yet again raised the question of how long governments will follow the practice that dents the country’s image and makes the conduct of its foreign policy inconsistent.Former foreign minister Narayan Khadka, who is a leader of the opposition Nepali Congress, argues that if an ambassador does not cooperate and support the government and if someone’s performance is poor, the government can recall them, but they should not be recalled en masse.The Cabinet meeting on Friday recommended ambassadors for eight countries while it has yet to pick envoys for three other countries. According to sources in the Prime Minister’s Office, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha was under pressure from Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and KP Sharma Oli, the chair of the major coalition partner CPN-UML, to recall the ambassadors and make new recommendations. An official at the PMO said that Shrestha wanted to recall those who have poor performance and to send ambassadors with good profiles and strong careers. “But that wasn’t meant to be and he eventually had to compromise with the prime minister and the UML chair,” the official said.The recommendation of Bijan Pant as ambassador to the United Kingdom was a major bone of contention between Dahal and Shrestha, said the official. Shrestha did not want to send ambassadors who didn’t have prior experience in diplomacy and international relations. The minister also wanted to avoid sending individuals with controversial backgrounds and those who have gotten repeated opportunities in state affairs, according to sources.The low point of Nepali diplomacy was when the government recalled Ambassador Shankar Sharma from India two days before Prime Minister Dahal’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, said Khadka. “Such decisions are made only by people with zero sense of diplomacy,” he added.Khadka believes that the decision was taken under Oli’s pressure and that the prime minister should at least have avoided recalling the ambassador from India for a few days. The prime minister could have recalled Sharma after he returned from India, he said.“Some ambassadors we picked in 2021 were really good. They deserved continuity but the prime minister, whose own term is uncertain, has decided to recall them,” said Khadka. “This shows the level of our diplomacy, a lack of common sense of our leaders as well as the ugly side of our politics and politicians.”The government on Friday recommended Lokdarshan Regmi, the former chief secretary and Nepal’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, as Nepal’s new envoy to India in place of incumbent ambassador, Sharma. Sharma was appointed under the Nepali Congress quota in 2021 by the Sher Bahadur Deuba government. Similarly, the government has named former commerce and industry secretary Chandra Ghimire Nepal’s new ambassador to the United States. The incumbent, Sridhar Khatri, appointed in the Congress quota in March 2022, has been recalled. Bijan Pant has been named ambassador to the United Kingdom. Pant previously served as a social development adviser to the erstwhile Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, the late Congress leader, and until recently worked as an adviser to the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). However, this time, he was chosen as an envoy by the CPN (Maoist Centre) in the party’s quota. According to a senior Maoist Centre leader, the sudden entry of Pant has sparked discontent in the prime minister’s party.Former member of the National Human Rights Commission, Sushil Pyakurel, has been recommended for South Korea, according to the Cabinet decision. Pyakurel, who also served as an adviser to the second President of the country, Bidya Devi Bhandari, will replace Jyoti Pyakurel Bhandari. Sumnima Tuladhar, a noted child rights activist and Executive Director of Child Workers in Nepal Concerned Centre (CWIN), has been recommended as Nepal's envoy to Denmark.Similarly, Pushpa Raj Rajkarnikar will replace Sharmila Parajuli Dhakal as envoy to Spain. Rajkarnikar is a former member of the National Planning Commission and an expert in trade and financial management.He was picked by the newly formed Ashok Rai-led Janata Samajbadi Party. The new party also got to pick an envoy for Saudi Arabia, whereby it chose to send Abu Sufayan Khan of Kapilbastu district.In Malaysia, Netra Prasad Timilsina, a long-time NGO activist, has been nominated under the UML quota. He replaces Dilli Raj Poudel, who was appointed under the CPN (Unified Socialist) quota.Among others, Pyakurel, Tuladhar and Timilsina have the background of working in the NGO sector. Of the 11 vacant posts, the government on Friday made recommendations for eight countries. Recommendations for Qatar, Israel, and Portugal are pending. Those recommended get appointed only after parliamentary hearing.Ruling partner Rastriya Swatantra Party will have its say in the appointment of two envoys. But party leaders said they are still unclear which country they will get to recommend the envoys for. “We are still clueless about the countries, but we are nonetheless preparing to find envoys for our quotas,” said an RSP leader.A joint-secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs argued how the latest episode has again underscored the need for the appointment of more career diplomats. “Political parties may still appoint ambassadors to countries like India, China, and the US, but we must send career diplomats to destinations other than the three countries,” he said. At present, out of 30 Nepali embassies and three permanent missions, 16 are headed by career diplomats. The career diplomats are leading the Nepali missions in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Egypt, France, Germany, Kuwait, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. All three Nepali permanent missions in New York, Geneva, and Vienna are also led by career diplomats.The joint-secretary said the career diplomat pie should increase from the current 50 percent to 80 or 90 percent, or the instability Nepal currently sees would continue. “The appointment of those with controversial backgrounds and despite their conflict of interest have further eroded Nepal’s image abroad. Unfortunately, this couldn’t be avoided in the appointments this time around as well,” rued the foreign ministry official.After 1990, there was the practice of recalling ambassadors after government change but the frequency of such changes greatly increased after 2006, said Yuba Nath Lamsal, former ambassador to Denmark. “If we properly screen ambassadorial candidates before their nomination and send them only after parliamentary hearing, there is no need to recall them so frequently. After all, they have been vetted in the country and have also gotten the required approval, known as ‘agrément’ in diplomatic terms, from the countries hosting them,” he said.Lamsal stressed the need to stop the frequent chopping and changing of the country’s envoys, in order to boost Nepal’s diplomatic credentials. The government in 2019 also came up with the criteria for ambassadorial appointment, but that was not followed by successive governments. Point 5 of the criteria, a copy of which was obtained by the Post, states: In view of the principle of inclusiveness, national welfare and the state’s representation, an experienced candidate with an excellent academic record and diplomatic capability will be appointed the ambassador.Point 6 further states: ambassadors must be capable and have the experience of Nepal’s foreign policy and international relations, and be informed on the dynamics of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy.Both of these criteria were ignored this time, just like they were in the past. Very few nominees have any kind of diplomatic experience or credentials. They meet only a few criteria such as being above 35 years of age, holding a bachelor’s degree, not having criminal records and not having been convicted of corruption. However, little attention is paid to avoid the conflict of interest and to meet the criteria of experience in international relations and expertise in the field of diplomacy. The criteria also states that ambassadorial appointees should hold “country-specific knowledge”. But hardly any of the nominees have relevant experience—professional or academic—on issues related to their host countries.Lamsal called for making the selection process transparent so that the host country takes Nepal’s ambassador seriously. “No doubt, envoys should be appointed on merit and they should be allowed to work for some time. Changing them frequently only tarnishes the country’s image,” he said. “This corrosive practice must stop.” ","summary":"Ambassadorial appointments, mostly after the restoration of democracy in 1990, have not been free from controversy.

But party leaders said they are still unclear which country they will get to recommend the envoys for. “We are still clueless about the countries, but we are nonetheless preparing to find envoys for our quotas,” said an RSP leader.A joint-secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs argued how the latest episode has again underscored the need for the appointment of more career diplomats. “Political parties may still appoint ambassadors to countries like India, China, and the US, but we must send career diplomats to destinations other than the three countries,” he said. At present, out of 30 Nepali embassies and three permanent missions, 16 are headed by career diplomats. The career diplomats are leading the Nepali missions in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Egypt, France, Germany, Kuwait, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. All three Nepali permanent missions in New York, Geneva, and Vienna are also led by career diplomats.The joint-secretary said the career diplomat pie should increase from the current 50 percent to 80 or 90 percent, or the instability Nepal currently sees would continue. “The appointment of those with controversial backgrounds and despite their conflict of interest have further eroded Nepal’s image abroad. Unfortunately, this couldn’t be avoided in the appointments this time around as well,” rued the foreign ministry official.After 1990, there was the practice of recalling ambassadors after government change but the frequency of such changes greatly increased after 2006, said Yuba Nath Lamsal, former ambassador to Denmark. “If we properly screen ambassadorial candidates before their nomination and send them only after parliamentary hearing, there is no need to recall them so frequently. After all, they have been vetted in the country and have also gotten the required approval, known as ‘agrément’ in diplomatic terms, from the countries hosting them,” he said.Lamsal stressed the need to stop the frequent chopping and changing of the country’s envoys, in order to boost Nepal’s diplomatic credentials. The government in 2019 also came up with the criteria for ambassadorial appointment, but that was not followed by successive governments. Point 5 of the criteria, a copy of which was obtained by the Post, states: In view of the principle of inclusiveness, national welfare and the state’s representation, an experienced candidate with an excellent academic record and diplomatic capability will be appointed the ambassador.Point 6 further states: ambassadors must be capable and have the experience of Nepal’s foreign policy and international relations, and be informed on the dynamics of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy.Both of these criteria were ignored this time, just like they were in the past. Very few nominees have any kind of diplomatic experience or credentials. They meet only a few criteria such as being above 35 years of age, holding a bachelor’s degree, not having criminal records and not having been convicted of corruption. However, little attention is paid to avoid the conflict of interest and to meet the criteria of experience in international relations and expertise in the field of diplomacy. The criteria also states that ambassadorial appointees should hold “country-specific knowledge”. But hardly any of the nominees have relevant experience—professional or academic—on issues related to their host countries.Lamsal called for making the selection process transparent so that the host country takes Nepal’s ambassador seriously. “No doubt, envoys should be appointed on merit and they should be allowed to work for some time. Changing them frequently only tarnishes the country’s image,” he said. “This corrosive practice must stop.” "},{"hash":"8a976c75e976c67bffebf0690536b64f30db0d98d679e9f4ce9d091803b46ba6","title":"yet-another-term-for-transitional-justice-bodies-amid-uncertainties","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/23/yet-another-term-for-transitional-justice-bodies-amid-uncertainties","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb4-1719105784.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719100800000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons have remained defunct for two years.

The commission has identified 2,494 cases falling under its jurisdiction for investigation. Similarly, 63,718 complaints have been registered with the Truth Commission.As parties have agreed to allow an additional three months to file complaints, mainly targeting war-era victims of sexual violence, the number of complaints is sure to increase.

Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to trim purchases.After a year, the situation seems unimproved.“We are not in the mood to place orders for goods for upcoming festivities,” said Ram Hari Karki, president of Nepal Trans Himalayan Border Commerce Association. “There is no demand at all. It looks like a deep economic slowdown.”Usually, traders place orders for foreign goods, particularly apparel, three months before the start of Nepal’s key festival season. Even though traders bring some amount of goods, it may be costlier. Due to the appreciation of the US dollar and increased customs duties, the prices of goods and commodities may rise, causing difficulties for many ordinary Nepalis.“Goods are becoming costlier day by day. That is why traders are cautious this year about placing orders,” said Karki. “The demand for festivities has not returned to the pre-pandemic level.”There are no statistics about consumption during the Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, but analysts say it grows manifold compared to the normal time. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said due to subdued demand, they may see a business decline by 15–20 percent. In comparison, prices may rise by 20 percent in the upcoming festivals.Even during the summer, traders say the market has slowed down.“Despite the rising heat, the demand for summer garments and shoes has not picked up,” said a trader in New Road, the country’s central shopping hub. “The footfall of shoppers has declined compared to last year’s season, reflecting the decline in people’s incomes.”“Nowadays, only a handful of traders are planning their trip to China to order goods. We don’t see demand recovering from last year’s drop,” said Kumar Karki.Some traders say there is a shift in the trade.In the past years, China fulfilled 80 percent of Nepal’s need for readymade garments.However, according to three top traders who spoke to the Post, the market seems flooded with Indian goods, which are relatively cheaper.Currently, traders said, an average of 15–20 loaded trucks are entering from Kerung and Tatopani customs points to the north, carrying garments, shoes and slippers, raincoats, and umbrellas, among other items. Before the Covid pandemic, 50–60 loaded trucks used to enter Nepal from the Chinese border at this time of the year.Cost is the key factor in subdued demand.On Friday, the Nepali rupee plunged to an all-time low of Rs134.15 against the dollar. A strong US dollar has advantages and disadvantages. It has negative impacts on an import-based economy like Nepal.“While importing goods, we must pay 30 to 40 percent as customs duty. The high customs duty has made imported goods expensive,” said Kumar Karki. The government needed to ease customs through the coming fiscal year's budget and further tighten it, he said. Importing goods through legal channels is becoming more difficult day by day, especially at the customs, and this has encouraged the illegal import of goods. This has resulted in an import decline.According to the central bank's macroeconomic report, the inflation rate on non-food and services remained at 2.96 percent in mid-May this year, compared to 8.89 percent a year ago. The year-on-year price index of clothes and footwear remained at 3.46 percent.Market analysts, however, say that data presents different facts than the actual market scenario. Economists say that youth are the significant spenders, and demand has declined in sectors like education and restaurants, including consumption of goods and services, as many youths have migrated abroad to study and work.Economist Nara Bahadur Thapa said that import-related activities used to increase by 30 percent with the start of a new fiscal year compared to other months before Covid. However, the number of traders importing goods by opening Letters of Credit (LC) has declined in recent years.“From July to October, imports used to spike and cross Rs200 billion per month, but now, even with the rise in foreign exchange rate, it hardly crosses Rs150 billion. This shows that the demand has declined as a result of economic slowdown,” Thapa said.Thapa said that as people's purchasing power has declined, the demand for different goods in major festival times has declined. The salaries of government and private sector employees have not increased in the past few years. “People are not going to spend unless they have money in their hands.”According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports declined by 1.84 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-June, compared to the same period last fiscal year.The country’s imports slipped 16.08 percent to Rs1.61 trillion in the last fiscal year.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

As per the provincial government’s plan, Baglung Municipality decided to establish the industrial village in around 100 ropanis of land in the Kalakhola area of Baglung-13.The municipality had levelled the ground and fenced the area. The municipality built infrastructures with a plan to establish some factories and industries in the industrial village immediately. However, the flooded river damaged the infrastructure during the monsoon season in 2021.“The municipality had to postpone its preparation to set up factories and industries as the river continued eroding the industrial village area,” said Basanta Kumar Shrestha, the mayor of Baglung Municipality. “The area is at high risk of erosion and landslide.”The river had already eroded around 30 ropanis of land of the industrial village. An approach road constructed in the area also caved in and it was later washed away by the river. The construction of the industrial village is now left in limbo after the municipality spent around Rs2 million.Baglung Municipality had a plan to shift around 50 factories and industries to the industrial village. “There are several saw mills and furniture industries, grill workshops and motor workshops in Baglung bazar area. They pollute the area. Such factories and industries need to be relocated to the industrial village to make the residence area clean and peaceful,” said Kumar Bikram Chhetri, ward chairman of Baglung-4.The Kaligandaki river changed its course in the Kalakhola area apparently due to haphazard extraction of river bed materials in Sahashradhara area. The change in the river's course intensified erosion on the Baglung side, mainly in the rainy season, leaving the industrial village and settlements at risk of floods.In 2020, the Supreme Court had banned the extraction of riverbed materials from the Kaligandaki river, but illegal extraction remains unchecked in the river.Baglung Municipality of Baglung, Kushma Municipality and Jaljala Rural Municipality of Parbat, and Beni Municipality and Annapurna Rural Municipality of Myagdi lie on the banks of the Kaligandaki river and are therefore responsible for the conservation of the river. The local units, whose responsibility is to monitor and control exploitation, and collect revenue, have been found incapable of controlling the rampant exploitation of riverbed materials, causing threat of floods and erosion.“After the Supreme Court’s order, Baglung Municipality stopped the extraction of riverbed materials. But illegal extraction is going on in the area. And we have to bear the brunt of the illegal activity,” said Shrestha.Baglung Municipality’s plan to establish the industrial village is almost foiled by the erosion. The remaining land of the industrial village and the local settlements are also at the risk of flood and erosion. The local people complain that around a dozen houses and ropanis of paddy fields will turn into the riverbank if the authorities concerned build an embankment immediately.“Our settlement is at risk,” said Mahendra Roka, a local of the Kalakhola area. “We don’t know when the river will sweep away our houses and paddy fields. The government should construct a concrete embankment to save the settlement and the industrial village.”The villagers complain that the illegal extraction of the riverbed materials goes unchecked which multiplies the risk of flood.Chief District Officer Netra Subedi, District Coordination Committee’s chief Amar Thapa and Mayor Shrestha made a field visit to the Kalakhola area a few days ago. After inspecting the area, Subedi assured that security would be tightened to curb illegal extraction of the riverbed materials.

Even in the small and noisy traffic island of Koteshwor junction, one can observe people resting and killing time. Similarly, plenty of people visit the open land of Koteshwor-Tinkune to play sports, and many more are there as spectators.These examples indicate the growing demand and potential for public spaces in Kathmandu.Having public spaces in urban areas has multiple benefits. Open spaces improve public health by providing space for physical activity and refreshment. They make places socially and economically vibrant by attracting people and activities. They serve as emergency shelters during disasters like earthquakes. If planned well, open spaces help in biodiversity conservation and groundwater recharge. However, the situation of open spaces in Kathmandu Valley is miserable. UN-Habitat recommends 15-20 percent of urban land for open public spaces. However, according to a report published by the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority, only 2.29 percent of the land was available as open space in 2012, and the condition has not improved. The irregular distribution of public spaces has also reinforced their unavailability. Advocates for urban public spaces recommend the availability of open spaces within walking distance, a 400-metre radius. However, many places in our cities do not have public spaces nearby, and even when they are available, they are usually gated and inaccessible.Public parks are confined within high boundary walls and gates. Shielding public spaces from the public is a paradox, although it is supported by common reasonings such as possible vandalism, waste littering and maintenance difficulty. As a result, we are undermining the value of public spaces.Similarly, unifunctional and exclusive planning approaches have also compromised the effectiveness of public spaces. Public parks designed for specific demographics, such as elderly people’s and children’s parks, have become a new trend. When this is not the case, the spaces still lack provisions for a diverse population: Women, children, differently abled and so on.Furthermore, ecological dimensions are rarely considered during the development of public spaces. Local hydrology, geology, biodiversity, and natural ecosystems are disregarded. Approaches like the plantation of non-native vegetation for mere beautification, a large proportion of hardscape, and the absence of stormwater management systems show a superficial approach to public space management.In addition to these issues, open spaces constantly threaten encroachment. Sometimes, encroachments seem like an act of conservation but end up with the controlled ownership of some individuals or groups. The Nepal Army’s occupation of part of Tundikhel is one such example. At other times, public spaces are intruded by building construction and infrastructural development. Despite all such challenges, urban public spaces can be enhanced in many ways.First and foremost, existing and potential open spaces should be identified; larger parks, khya (culturally significant open lands), urban pockets, riverfronts, traditional ponds, courtyards and other potential spaces should be mapped out and planned for. Encroached public lands should be reclaimed. As for new urban areas, the government should provide open spaces beforehand.After that, identified public spaces should be managed, with due consideration of their typology and context. Larger parks can be developed with a significant proportion of native greenery and diverse spaces such as sports areas, recreational areas, water bodies, and gardens. Basic services like public toilets and drinking water services should be arranged.Smaller spaces can be designed as urban green pockets. Machhindra Park near Jawalakhel is one good example. Cultural-communal lands such as Khya should be managed with minimal interventions.Riverside landscape can also be capitalised as urban public spaces. Some riverside parks, such as Sankhamul Park, have already demonstrated the use value of riverfronts. However, the custom of retaining wall boundaries and ornamental landscape disassociates the river’s relationship with the land and people. Therefore, riverside development that promotes biodiversity and ecological sustainability and strengthens people’s physical and spiritual relationship with water is essential.Next, we can capitalise on traditional open spaces like ponds and courtyards. For instance, ponds can be revitalised with proper pavements, seating spaces, and safety. Pim Bahal Pukhu at Patan and Nigu Pukhu at Thimi are perfect examples of traditional pond-based revitalisation that boosted the place’s socio-economic activities.Furthermore, creative strategies are required to transform unconventional spaces such as overhead bridges, sidewalks, bus stops, and traffic islands into appealing public spaces. For instance, a pedestrian bridge, beyond its functional use of crossing roads, can act as a lively space if upgraded with public space amenities. Greenery addition, shed, carved-out spaces for interaction, seating spaces, and artworks are a few strategies. Likewise, wide sidewalks can be transformed into green infrastructure networks constituting rest spaces, kiosks and drinking water fountains.Lastly, the most important step in public space management is to embrace the ‘Make it Simple’ design approach. This will significantly help tackle the issues of maintenance challenges, budgetary limitations and environmental degradation. Barrier concepts should be replaced with design and management solutions to resolve public space maintenance issues. Too many interventions and high-maintenance elements such as fountains, extravagant lighting and furniture can be intentionally avoided. Simple open ground composed of local vegetation, seating platforms, and minimal hardscape with durable materials like stones can also make beautiful parks. Providing open spaces is not enough in itself, though. For example, the Dharahara complex, although designed as a landmark public space, isolates itself from the surrounding context. Ultimately, public spaces should be physically well interconnected with existing urban networks to make them more accessible, practical, and contextual.

Pim Bahal Pukhu at Patan and Nigu Pukhu at Thimi are perfect examples of traditional pond-based revitalisation that boosted the place’s socio-economic activities.Furthermore, creative strategies are required to transform unconventional spaces such as overhead bridges, sidewalks, bus stops, and traffic islands into appealing public spaces. For instance, a pedestrian bridge, beyond its functional use of crossing roads, can act as a lively space if upgraded with public space amenities. Greenery addition, shed, carved-out spaces for interaction, seating spaces, and artworks are a few strategies. Likewise, wide sidewalks can be transformed into green infrastructure networks constituting rest spaces, kiosks and drinking water fountains.Lastly, the most important step in public space management is to embrace the ‘Make it Simple’ design approach. This will significantly help tackle the issues of maintenance challenges, budgetary limitations and environmental degradation. Barrier concepts should be replaced with design and management solutions to resolve public space maintenance issues. Too many interventions and high-maintenance elements such as fountains, extravagant lighting and furniture can be intentionally avoided. Simple open ground composed of local vegetation, seating platforms, and minimal hardscape with durable materials like stones can also make beautiful parks. Providing open spaces is not enough in itself, though. For example, the Dharahara complex, although designed as a landmark public space, isolates itself from the surrounding context. Ultimately, public spaces should be physically well interconnected with existing urban networks to make them more accessible, practical, and contextual.

Visiting the exhibitions, closely observing the artworks, and interacting with the curators and some artists, I realised that the quest for the right idioms to express the major motifs of paintings continues to be the main thrust of the artists. In this article, I am alluding to the genre of paintings exhibited in galleries. I have attempted to review the paintings displayed at the exhibitions and briefly discuss the diverse modalities and practices of exhibitions, as well as the impact of audience-oriented activism. Though I have been writing on the diverse genres and forms of Nepali art like sculpture, architecture and installation-oriented works mainly curated in Nepal by Sangeeta Thapa through major events under such rubrics as “biennale and triennale”, I have mostly produced reviews of paintings over the decades. I have put my review writings in catalogues and journals. In recent years, I have been writing articles on art for the academic journal Sirjana of the Sirjana College of Fine Arts. Navindra Man Rajbhandari, an artist, art teacher, curator, and pedagogue, has been working earnestly to edit and publish this journal. I visited the painting exhibitions in the major galleries—two at the Nepal Art Council, Babarmahal and one each at the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts and the Siddhartha Art Gallery. Interestingly, all these exhibitions are audience-oriented. The painting exhibition practice often follows the rituals of cataloguing the works with simple introductions and price tags written somewhat half-heartedly. They also mention the mediums used by the painters, like oil, water, gouache and, very commonly, acrylic. From the early artists who were exposed to Western art to those of contemporary times in Nepal, all use the same mediums as artists anywhere in the world. These mediums are the universal shapers of the idioms of paintings. Nepali painters use the above-mentioned mediums and other admixtures according to their modern training and indigenous painting traditions. The evolution of colour paintings, especially oil, marks the presence of the audience or the clientele of paintings; it has become a commonly recognised subject. All came through modern education in art. Artists’ emotions and the consonance of cultural and aesthetic factors are commonly represented in such paintings.One eloquent example was seen at an art exhibition, “Deities of Nepal II”, held at the Nepal Art Council in May-June 2024. This exhibition, principally curated by the art academic Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, presented some remarkable paintings and their projection modalities. The diversity of the paintings executed according to the overt and covert themes of sacrality had one common element. Their choice of colours and hues and their delineation to create the exquisite beauty of the mythopoetic figural of the characters in the paintings was one eloquent feature. Modern painters also treated the divine figures and their aura in their non-figural works. I especially liked the modern techniques in these paintings about the deities. The thrust was experimental. Some artists, comparatively, made very good paintings; others were just cliché works, naturally. However, the common strength and feature of all the paintings that featured the iconography was what the brief brochure text says: The composition of “the deities intricately woven into a tapestry of philosophical and spiritual beliefs.” The other was the search for an appropriate style for projecting the spiritual motifs. The paintings appeared to establish a covenant with the audience, this time through a pricing pattern. Paintings were liberally priced; some were priced up to Rs4 million. And the remarkable matter was that some of these expensive paintings were “sold” to Nepali buyers. We should remember that the paintings were sold as works of art, not as pictures of religious iconographies. The entry of the modern audience into Nepali paintings is what matters here. John Berger, a great art critic, says that the painting itself should generate the buyer’s desirability through its touchable and visual attraction. I saw this covenant at this exhibition. The next display was the “National Exhibition of Fine Arts 2024”. This one presents a different perspective in my collection several decades’ glossy catalogues of the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts. This exhibition, curated by Devendra Kumar Kafle, aka Thumkeli, its member secretary, and other departmental academy members, presents a unique view of Nepali art. Kafle guided me through the variety of artworks and described the collection methods. The collection is based on the modality of sampling artworks of Indigenous and regional features and bringing them out to the national exhibition, which is a remarkable activity. The Academy has published small glossy catalogues for them. In his note, the Chancellor of the Academy, Naradmani Hartumchali, says this is a culmination of such exhibitions in all seven states. He stresses the need to bring art to a level where indigenous forms could be made a topic of political significance by evoking such features as representation and social transformation. I don't know of any well-researched discussions on this important topic initiated by any authentic institutions. But the exhibition speaks for itself. The current exhibition, “Threads of Simultaneity”, organised by ‘Sirjana 2024’ and mainly curated by Navindra Man Rajbhandari, exhibits 200 pieces of artwork executed by 28 artists at the Arts Council. Artist Rajbhandari revealed that the exhibition was an attempt to project a historicity of a combined nature of art activity shared entirely by the academic cohort of the institution. The exhibition features some works of the erstwhile principals Sashi Shah (2001-11), Krishna Manandhar (2011-17) and Madan Chitrakar (2018-22), and members of the Sirjana College of Arts like Vatsa Gopal Vaidya and other senior artists associated with the college one way or the other. Works of the young and senior artists are on display. I also want to recall yet another unique exhibition organised by Siddhartha Art Gallery, “Sawari Kathaharu: Art in Motion”, in May 2024. The concept of motion in art is presented by creating the art of motion, as in Ralph Lily Turner’s “Storms”, Hokusai’s “Great Waves”, Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica” and Sashi Shah’s “Darting Horses”, to take a few examples. Capturing the fixed images mounted on darting objects like vehicles and exhibiting them in a reputed gallery is designed to showcase experimental works and their appeal.May and June 2024 were eventful in the realm of Nepali art.

After years of awareness campaigns and the breaking of chhau sheds by central and local governments as well as non-governmental agencies, the victimisation of women remains a daily occurrence in several parts of Nepal, especially Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005; in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But the inhumane practice remains deeply rooted in parts of Nepali society. While reports of extreme cases come from the hinterlands, menstrual taboo rules the roost even in the sophisticated drawing rooms and kitchens of urban centres. Impurity runs in the psyche of the average Nepali; menstrual blood simply oils the juggernaut of superstition, patriarchy and misogyny that is Nepali society.As disturbing as the news of the rape is the report that the victim’s relatives tried to conceal the incident.

That is why, despite a long apprenticeship in bilateral relations, I consider myself a novice on the subject. Sometimes, our limited knowledge creates misunderstanding and distrust even if the relationship remains intact. For the past 60 years or so, some people have tried to define the Nepal-India relationship in their own emotional ways but have failed to make any dent without India’s wish. Their concern is understandable when seen from the perspective of broad principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence, forgetting that inter-state relations are guided more by pragmatism than principles. For any country, national interest is supreme while conducting foreign policies. Most politicians and intellectuals driven by emotions forget that the conditions surrounding them are more deterministic than their feelings. Here comes the question of geo-politics, geo-economics and geo-strategic contexts.The Nepal-India relationship since the Treaty of Sugauli continues to define both limitations of powers and the relationship pattern. Even if some minor adjustments or changes occur, the substance and nature of bilateral relations remain the same. For some Nepalis, symbols matter more than substance, which is vital for conducting bilateral ties. Even then, both countries do not deviate from the main course of the unchanged relationship. India, too, has not departed from conventional policy by trying to operate within the same parameters as the old rulers. Even if the situation and context changed, the basics of the relationship remain the same.India does not like to disturb the structure of the relationship, relating it to its larger national security issue. It seems that even in the future, apart from some minor adjustments, it is unlikely to be drastically altered. Indians think opening the 1950 Treaty is like opening the “pandora’s box” and, hence, needs to be cautiously handled. Without being on the firm ground of reality, Nepalis will experience more woes. Knowing the implications and given the limited strategic autonomy, King Mahendra, apparently a die-hard nationalist, also didn’t raise the issue of the 1950 treaty. Still, policy measures adopted by the royal government and India have led to the erosion of some treaty provisions. Coming close on the heels of the continuity of the relationship, the former foreign secretary and Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shyam Saran, said at a talk programme recently, “There will be more continuity than departure in India’s foreign policy in coming days–in rhetoric and style”. Then what alternative approach can Nepal take? I think focusing on the country’s development, projection of good governance and image by showing the ability to prosper and make people confident should be the strategy. If all-round development takes place by raising people's life standards, national confidence and maturity would grow, eventually leading to better cooperation with the immediate neighbours. The status of a nation is not raised by too much politicisation of relationships, as we have been witnessing for over six decades. Nor is foreign policy conducted through an emotional approach alone. Some developmental activities and formal and informal channels used by both sides to sort out immediate problems arising from time to time can measure how the two countries have stabilised bilateral relations and cooperative endeavours since the 1950s. Regime changes have not at all affected the continuity of the developmental process. Today, the development pace is faster than before. The political environment, irrespective of governments, is favourable, as parties and leaders seem to have understood the significance of development despite their subjective views on various issues. Now, Nepal and India have reached an understanding of purchasing 10000 megawatts of electricity by India and facilitating Nepal’s use of the Indian corridor for power sale to Bangladesh. Since Nepal and India are two separate nations politically and historically, civilisational commonalities do not always work when the question of nation-state arises. Therefore, it is natural that some divergent approaches to events and developments are noticed not to the extent of damaging the structure and dynamics of bilateral relationships. Some issues are perceived differently by the elites of the two countries. For example, some patches of the border often trigger controversy. The two governments have claimed that 97 percent of the border problem will be solved if both sides officially agree. But Nepal is not prepared to agree unless other disputed territories such as Sushta, Kalapanri-Lipulekh and Limpiadhura are settled. Sushta’s problem could have been settled long ago as it is not serious from an Indian security point of view. The Kalapani issue is complex because India considers it settled, but it contrasts with Nepal’s claim that goes far beyond the existing border. Since the newly adopted map called chuche naksa (pointed map) that shows the border up to Limpiadhura has already been passed by the Nepali Parliament by a two-thirds majority after reaching some sort of national consensus, it has become more complex. India reacted to Nepal’s action as a unilateral “cartographic assertion”, adding that the lands claimed by Nepal belong to India. The issue has become more complicated because of the long Indian rule (bhogchalan) and Nepal’s new claim as its territory. In addition to such complex issues, minor problems such as waterlogging in some parts of the Tarai, inundation, floods and trade deficit reduction are nagging. However, the issue of balance of trade entirely lies with Nepal’s capacity to enhance production and make Nepali products market-worthy in India and elsewhere. Only then can Nepal expect India’s cooperation to facilitate Nepali products to enter the Indian market. Mutual trust and confidence on both sides are essential to resolve ensuing differences, big or small. Moreover, perception, rather than reality, gives grounds for distrust. India should not be too suspicious of Nepal’s relations with China and other Western powers, especially the US, as it is armed with leverage over Nepal because, even if it wishes, the latter cannot cross the Rubicon due to various compulsions.   ","summary":"The Nepal-India relationship is complex, wide-ranging and deep, making it difficult to fathom.

Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said four of those hurt were in serious condition.“This Russian terror through guided bombs must be stopped and can be stopped,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.“We need strong decisions from our partners to enable us to stop the Russian terrorists and Russian military aviation right where they are.”Later, in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said Russian forces had used more than 2,400 guided bombs on Ukrainian targets in June alone, with about 700 aimed at Kharkiv.He said after US Congress gave delayed approval of a big aid package in April, Ukraine's replenished arms supplies had reduced the devastation and frequency of missile attacks and the same had to be done now to fend off these bombs.“The significant reduction in Russian missile terror against Kharkiv and the region proves it is entirely possible to secure our cities and communities from Russian bombs,” he said.Ukraine, he said, needed promised military aid packages “without delay so that the agreements we reached with (US) President Biden can be realised.”Ukraine and the US signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement this month aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defense against Russia and getting Ukraine closer to NATO membership.Russia has relied increasingly on relatively inexpensive guided bombs, dropped from a distance and involving fewer risks for its forces.Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has advanced slowly through Donetsk region in the east, capturing a string of villages since seizing the key industrial town of Avdiivka more than three months ago.It launched a cross-border incursion north of Kharkiv last month, though Zelenskiy says the situation there has stabilised.In the latest bomb attack, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said there had been four strikes on Kharkiv.Regional governor Syniehubov said rescue work was proceeding at the building, which housed a store on the ground floor.Kharkiv Police Chief Serhiy Bolvinov told public broadcaster Suspilne that three floors had collapsed, but he believed no one was trapped under the rubble.Kharkiv lies about 30 km (20 miles) from the border with Russia. The city of 1.3 million people has frequently been targeted in Russian attacks during nearly 28 months of war.Moscow denies deliberately targeting civilians but thousands have been killed and injured in the war.

Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for a treasurer position; and 34 leaders had filed their candidacies for seven positions of secretary.To the question of whether the leaders had deferred the election finding it difficult to pick individuals for available positions, party insiders gave multiple answers.A leader linked the leadership election deferral to the party split in the first week of May.A group of JSP-Nepal leaders split the party and formed the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission registered the new outfit on May 6.The JSP-Nepal led by Yadav on May 13 moved the Supreme Court, accusing the commission of recognising its splinter group as a party without the legal basis.Yadav, in his petition, claimed that the commission had registered the party even without the required 40 percent central members on its side. The top court has ordered the relevant authorities to stall the process until the verdict and the case is still sub judice.The uncertainty prevents the newly formed Rai-led party from expediting its activities in a formal way. Seven of the 12 JSP-Nepal lawmakers in the federal parliament and 30 of the 406 party central committee members are with Rai.The new outfit’s plan to build its organisation at the provincial and local levels is in limbo due to the delayed court process. Leaders from the new party claimed that a large number of leaders and cadres are waiting to join the new organisation. Moreover, they are planning to embrace those aspirants of top positions when they are denied posts in central bodies. Observers of Madhesh politics claimed that the JSP-Nepal was unable to complete its election process with the splinter faction eying to lure its members. However, Manish Kumar Suman, one of the aspirants for general secretary in the JSP-Nepal, denied it. He claimed that the stalled general convention process, including the selection of leaders for office bearers positions, would be completed within a week.“As per the election commission deadline, we have to complete the whole general convention process within 35 days,” Suman told the Post. “We will complete the process before the timeframe.”Some political observers say the JSP-Nepal went for the general convention only out of the constitutional compulsion. If the party really wanted to follow the democratic process, it should have allowed the election process to go forward.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates the political parties to hold the general convention at least once in five years.“Upendra Yadav has made himself the JSP-Nepal patron,” Shiva Chandra Chaudhary, a Madhesh political observer, told the Post. “He can select leaders loyal to him, having been reelected the party chairman. So he stalled the democratic process.”On the other hand, the new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—too has failed to give momentum to the party building process in the six weeks since its inception.The new outfit has gained prominence apparently with the support of the ruling coalition. The Election Commission swiftly registered the new party on May 6 with the name similar to the mother party despite legal ambiguities in the process. The JSP joined the ruling coalition immediately after its formation and supported the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. The Rai-led party has been given a Cabinet minister and a state minister. On Saturday, when the Cabinet made recommendations for ambassadors to eight countries, two nominations went to the new outfit’s supporters. Ambassadors for Saudi Arabia and Spain were appointed in the JSP quotas. Days after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support to the government, the Rai-led JSP gave its trust vote to Dahal and it supported the government in its policies and programmes.Lawmaker Sushila Shrestha of the JSP tried to downplay the difficulties saying that they were carrying out the party’s activities quietly. “We are engaged in several activities to strengthen the newly formed party, but we are not visible in the media,” Shrestha claimed. “Next Saturday and Sunday, our party’s central committee is meeting.” Shrestha claimed that her party is stronger than the JSP-Nepal in the provinces except for Madhesh. “We have been holding the meetings of provincial committees and are working to make our presence felt in Madhesh Province too.”Though Shrestha claims there are a number of activities within the party, political observers believe that its activities are stagnant due to the case sub judice in the court. “A writ petition in the Supreme Court related to the party split has stalled the new party formation,” Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst, told the Post.Yadav has claimed the commission registered the party despite its failure to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a party split. JSP-Nepal had 406 central committee members at the time of the party split, but the splinter group only had 30 central members with it.The newly formed JSP was registered amid a legal void as the Political Parties Act 2017 was replaced by an ordinance but not revived afterwards. According to the Act, a group of dissidents can split a party and form a new one if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members and at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, leaving no legal basis for a party split. On June 9, the Supreme Court referred the dispute related to the party to the full bench.

Since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is the authorised body to collect the complaints, advocates for the victims doubt the legitimacy of the applications solicited by the local governments. “What will be the legality of the applications? Will they be recognised by the TRC? As far as I know, the TRC will not accept them,” said Devi Khadka, coordinator of the National Association of Conflict Rape Victims, a network of CRSV victims.The government issued a circular to the local governments to collect the applications with the primary objective of providing relief and compensation to the insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual assault. The state continues to neglect such victims. Neither have they been recognised by the state nor have they received any relief from the government. As many as 63,718 complaints have been registered with the TRC. However, only 314, less than half a percent of the total, are related to rape and sexual violence. Very few victims lodged complaints as they were not convinced that their records would be kept confidential, according to Khadka. “We are not convinced that the local governments can maintain confidentiality. Unlike other victims, they cannot come out on the open because of the social stigma associated,” she said. “Most victims of rape and sexual violence haven’t revealed their ordeals even to their husbands and close family members. Doing so means breaking their families.”If Khadka’s claim is anything to go by, seven insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual violence from a local unit in the Sudurpaschim Province are in trouble as it could not keep their secrets. The representatives at the local level, however, say they are working to support the victims as per the federal government’s circular. “Some 35 victims have applied at our municipality. We are serious about maintaining their confidentiality,” Tilakram Lamsal, mayor at Thakurbaba Municipality in Bardiya, told the Post. He, however, said he was unaware whether the TRC or the federal government will recognise the applications they have collected.Officials at the home ministry also say they are not sure about the legality of the complaints. Radha Kumari Shrestha, an officer with the Peace Promotion Department at the Ministry of Home Affairs, said they got the circular to register the victims for their documentation and to provide relief and reparations. “I am not sure whether the TRC will own up the applications,” she told the Post, adding that respective local governments are responsible for maintaining confidentiality.Through the national budget the federal government has announced plans to create a peace fund of Rs1 billion to provide compensation and financial support to conflict victims. Similarly, different local governments also have allocated budgets to support conflict victims including the CRSV. After months-long discussions, cross-party lawmakers have agreed to allow three months for the registration of the complaints by the victims who missed out on doing so in the past. The victims say the government and parties should prioritise endorsing the amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, which will formally open the doors for the TRC to receive the complaints.Laxmi Pokharel, a human rights lawyer with the International Court of Jurists, said the idea of allowing the local governments to keep records of victims is not wrong. However, there are no proper mechanisms at the local units to safely keep the records of the victims of rape and sexual violence. “There is no uniformity among the local governments in providing relief. While some are working actively, several others are doing nothing. This is leading to disparity,” she told the Post. “The federal government should formulate a uniform policy in providing relief, one that will be applicable across the country.”Currently, the Khadka-led organisation has been continuously working to screen the physical and mental health of CRSV victims. A recent medical test conducted among 38 rape victims from the Maoist insurgency showed 11 of them had cancer. Similarly, an additional eight need immediate surgery to remove their uterus. “Further tests are being conducted to ascertain the stage of their cancer. This is very serious,” said Khadka. In the medical tests conducted in December last year, an overwhelming 70 percent of the 127 victims had one or more reproductive health-related complications. The health condition of five of them was bad enough to need regular tests and treatment.  ","summary":"The advocates for justice for victims of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) have objected to the decision by local governments to start registration of such victims, questioning its legality and assurance of confidentiality.Following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, a number of local governments have started collecting applications from the victims of conflict-related sexual violence.The applications have been called from women and girls who faced sexual violence at the hands of state security forces and then Maoist rebels, but whose cases are missing from the state’s records of victims.

An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rima’s body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rima’s house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rima’s quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepal’s decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepal’s conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepal’s history.Devi Khadka’s story had haunted me for years. I’d read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known ‘feminist’ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, it’s easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, “I’ve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.” Yet, some from Nepal’s transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her “political” and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. I’ve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, she’s been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepal’s transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as well—a way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepal’s transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepal’s wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal player—not a victim any more, but a leader—will strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist.

Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you.

Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka.

Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepal’s 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepal’s domestic airlines—nine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicopters—flew 4.15 million passengers in 2023. ","summary":"The process of enacting a separate air carriers’ liability and insurance legislation for domestic carriers has stalled yet again.On March 1, the Cabinet approved the tourism ministry’s proposal to prepare a draft bill on domestic air carriers’ liability and insurance.This was done years after Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999, which makes international airlines liable in case of death or injury to passengers. Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say.

Before his tenure at the Supreme Court, he held positions as a judge in various district and high courts across Nepal. Bhattarai is also the author of four books focusing on law and environmental issues.In a conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Bhattarai discusses the interplay between law and literature, his reading habits, and book recommendations for aspiring lawyers.How is law and literature related?Law and literature share an intrinsic relationship. From an academic perspective, jurisprudence, often known as the philosophy of law, includes both fields of law and literature. A saying goes, “Asal faisala asal sahitya ho,” (True judgement is true literature). The ones who are adept in language have been able to become luminary judges. One example is the former Chief Justice of India, VR Krishna Iyer. He had an English literature background.While law is not entirely an open-ended discourse like literature, from a literary perspective, it can sometimes exhibit open-ended qualities. The flexibility in interpretation from a literary perspective allows for changes in legal decisions over time. This is why certain legal decisions may evolve or change as perspectives and contexts shift.How did you start reading?When I became a literature student, my love for literature developed. I have a special inclination for the works of acclaimed poets such as Hari Bhakta Katuwal and Ashesh Malla. My upbringing also deepened my love for reading. My brother and I used to recite Bhupi Sherchan’s poems, and my mother would recite Satyakli’s verses. It was a tradition to read the Ramayana every day in the evening as well.I was also fascinated by the works of William Shakespeare and Francis Bacon. Among Nepali writers, the works of Samrat Upadhya and Manjushree Thapa’s ‘Forget Kathmandu’ have left an impression on me. Why should law students read?Reading is crucial to establishing a conceptual clarity of any subject matter. After one develops conceptual clarity, it becomes easy to analyse the matter. For instance, when one becomes well-versed in the subjugation caused by patriarchy, it becomes easier to dissect the issue within the legal framework. A few years ago, the issue of women’s right to parental property sparked significant debate, with some arguing against granting these rights. However, when viewed from the perspective of rights and through the lens of the jurisprudence of equality, such debates become clearer and more justified. Therefore, reading and studying these perspectives greatly benefits law students.How do you manage time to read? When you have a demanding job, it is difficult to find the time to read. Your workload keeps you from relishing leisure activities. However, for me, there has always been a drive to read books beyond my field of expertise.I believe time does not come in blocks, instead, it flows continuously and is experienced moment by moment. Thus, even if I get an hour or so off from work, I use it to read books.Has reading influenced your perspective when making judicial decisions? I have relied on information in many books, which have shaped my case decisions to some extent. One such influential book is ‘Hiti Pranali’ by Padma Sunder Joshi. The book’s well-researched content provided me with a deeper understanding of the environmental and cultural aspects of the Kathmandu Valley's water system. Similarly, Amartya Sen’s ‘Development as Freedom’ and ‘Theory of Justice’ have provided a practical framework for judicial decisions.Which book has had the most impact on you? Literary theories helped me understand jurisprudence from a philosophical angle. Stanley Fish’s reader-response theory and the writings of Jacques Derrida have significantly shaped my thought process in the legal field.What would you suggest to young lawyers?I encourage young lawyers to consider both jurisprudence and constitutional law as essential courses and to read extensively on these topics. Additionally, human rights law is an emerging field with many new areas to explore. Studying this field helps humanise the law, making it easier to become a judge by offering fresh perspectives. For instance, understanding that “rape is not just a crime; it is an attack on the dignity of a human being” allows us to see people as human beings and respect their dignity.When studying constitutional Law, we integrate human rights and constitutional law within the framework of rights. A strong foundation in these subjects, along with good research skills, helps law students develop an effective approach.In our evolving system, which values comparative law, it is important to engage with various streams of thought rather than focusing on just one.Ananda Mohan Bhattarai’s Book recommendations: Nepali Kanuni Itihas ko RuprekhaAuthor: Rewati Raman Khanal Publisher: Pairavi Book HouseYear: 2002Rich in information and shedding light on Nepal’s political, social, and cultural dynamics, it is an insightful account of events that unfolded during the Rana regime.

The government resumed the allowance in some state agencies, including the Election Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, but not in Parliament, said Belbase.“We are not going to compromise this time,” Belbase said. “This is a fight for justice.” "},{"hash":"ccb14e8bbb52a210d9a4c9e82e6096b591daa4e9fe332265638d9ea91504a977","title":"why-would-a-former-president-return-to-party-politics","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/21/why-would-a-former-president-return-to-party-politics","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/thumb-1718933673.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718928000000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"The news of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari renewing her party membership has become a matter of discussion in Parliament. The ninth general convention of CPN-UML held in Kathmandu in 2014 had elected Bhandari a vice-chair of the party. After Bhandari was elected the country’s President in 2015, she gave up the party membership as mandated by the constitution. She secured the second term in the presidential election following the 2017 parliamentary polls. After Ramchandra Paudel replaced her as the head of state last year, Bhandari has been relieved of duties and has been enjoying state facilities as a former President. Parliamentarians have started asking: Can a former head of state who has been enjoying state perks return to active politics? They have also demanded that the government look into the services provided to the former head of state. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada, who chairs the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, said the government should clarify whether former President Bhandari qualifies for state benefits after renewing her UML membership. Media reports suggest the former President renewed her membership in a political party, Khatiwada said. “After the party membership renewal, can she still enjoy state benefits?” he questioned. “What is the state’s take on this?”He also demanded the government inform Parliament about the arrangements made for the former President.The Constitution of Nepal is silent on whether a former head of state can engage in active politics after leaving office.However, this is a question of constitutional ethics, says Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general.“If we look at the examples of other countries, a former head of state does not return to active politics, let alone by reclaiming the membership of a party,” Shrestha told the Post. “It is a question of ethics.” CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Pampha Bhusal said the question of morality only applies to the one who sticks to it. “If we see the history of Nepal, we find that a person who has become the prime minister has become an ambassador and taken other responsibilities,” Bhusal told the Post. “It is a personal decision whether to rejoin active politics after serving as the head of state. Let’s not make too big a fuss about this.”However, political observers and analysts say that when a person who has been receiving state benefits for their former role returns to active politics, it raises serious questions about that person and the party that gives the membership. Nepal has yet to formulate policies on the perks and benefits to be provided to a former head of state. The current practice is for the Cabinet to decide on such perks, according to an officer at the home ministry. “The former President gets a monthly stipend of Rs50,000. Another Rs200,000 is provided in monthly house rent,” said the officer. “If the former President has a house of their own in Kathmandu and decides to stay there, they get Rs100,000 a month in maintenance expenses.” They also get security personnel. However, the ministry officer refused to disclose the ‘sensitive’ security details. Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of Nepal, claims funds for housing from the government whereas Bhandari lives in her own house. Even before retiring from presidential duties, Bhandari had decided that she would go back to her own house, fuelling speculations about her plan to return to active politics. Bhandari is the widow of the late communist leader Madan Bhandari, who provided the ideological line to the UML. Most of Nepal’s major communist forces, the Maoist Centre led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the CPN (Unified Socialist) led by Madhav Kumar Nepal acknowledge the role of Madan Bhandari in advancing the communist cause in the country.UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Nepal and Dahal have once been together in a single political party after the 2017 elections. Whenever the communist forces form a coalition, as the three parties are doing now, the issue of their strategic partnership comes up.The Nepal Communist Party (NCP), as the unified force was called, saw a split when Dahal and Oli jointly chaired it but Oli is often criticised for being chiefly responsible for the unified party’s failure given his leadership style. Now when the three forces are rumoured to be planning to contest the 2027 elections on the same side, the chances of former President Bhandari returning to politics to potentially unite the parties as a leader acceptable to all are said to be high.Bhandari reportedly renewed party membership on the Nepali New Year day, more than two months ago. Madhav Dhungel, the secretary of the central organisation department of the UML, took to social media on June 18 to clarify the issue. “There is no doubt that Bhandari became President as a UML leader. But then she had to distance herself from the party, and she did so,” reads the facebook status of Dhungel. “However, she has the right to provide guardianship to the whole country, the Nepali people and the political party that she nurtured.”“Whether to return to active politics is a personal matter. If she [Bhandari] does so, she won’t do so on the sly,” Dhungel writes. “If she desires to be active in politics, she will undoubtedly do so in the UML.”On the question of Bhandari renewing her party membership, Kashinath Adhikari, the head of the party’s central organisation department, said he was not in a position to give a definite answer. “Membership in our party is renewed at the start of the [Nepali] new year,” Adhikari told the Post. “Who all have renewed party membership will be known only after going through the final list of those doing so in the given time.”  ","summary":"The news of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari renewing her party membership has become a matter of discussion in Parliament.

Among those notably absent were top leaders including Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli and CPN (Unified Socialist) chief Madhav Nepal, as well as several Cabinet ministers and dozens of lawmakers from ruling and opposition benches. Out of 22, only eight ministers were present. A Nepali Congress leader said that Congress President Deuba was briefly present in the House, but had to leave due to health issues. But other senior Congress leaders and office bearers were notably absent. Similarly, CPN-UML chair Oli visited Parliament but did not enter the House. He left Parliament premises before the prime minister started speaking. Oli attended another function in the Capital.Several Cabinet ministers including two deputy prime ministers Raghubir Mahaseth and Narayan Kaji Shrestha were also absent when Dahal was responding to lawmakers’ queries. “There has been a tradition in Parliament that leaders of both opposition and ruling parties should be present when the prime minister speaks. The absence does not undermine the prime minister but rather the parliamentarians themselves. Except in emergencies, leaders of ruling and opposition parties, ministers and lawmakers traditionally attend the meeting where the prime minister speaks. But this tradition is being watered down, day by day. This definitely does not undermine the prime minister’s position,” said Dahal.The visibly upset prime minister said before concluding his statement by warning that “if such a trend continues, it is a gross insult to all of us.”Before making this statement, the prime minister answered questions from eleven lawmakers on various issues. He also discussed his recent visit to India and President Ramchandra Paudel’s visits to Switzerland and Germany.Prime Minister Dahal, earlier this month, attended the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. He also held talks with Indian President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Modi, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, among other top officials.During his meetings with Modi and Jaishanker, Dahal said, issues related to strengthening bilateral ties, activating bilateral mechanisms between Nepal and India, and increasing Indian investment in Nepal, among others, were discussed.While speaking in the House, the prime minister expressed his dissatisfaction with budgetary allocations stating the ministers did not follow his directives.“Ministers should take the prime minister’s directive seriously while selecting projects and programmes,” said Dahal. “Despite my directives, small and micro projects are still being included in the budget. You will be ministers and prime ministers tomorrow, so we need to correct these practices.”“Despite tall promises, this fiscal year’s budget has several small and micro level projects below Rs30 million. The government had earlier promised to entrust projects and programmes under Rs30 million to provincial governments. I am not fully satisfied with the budget and its provisions.”While responding to lawmakers’ queries, the prime minister said that those responsible for the Tikapur massacre would be punished. As many as eight people, including a toddler and seven policemen, were killed by protesters on August 24, 2015 in the run up to the promulgation of the constitution. Dahal also assured that the government is committed to ensuring the identity and social and economic empowerment of the Tharus and other socially and economically marginalised communities.The prime minister also informed Parliament that Nepal and India are seriously considering two dedicated religious corridors—the Ramayana and Buddha circuits—to promote religious tourism.“We have ensured the budget for developing Ramayana, Shiva, Buddha, and Kirat circuits,” said the prime minister. “Fifteen different religious sites between Nepal and India will be connected under the Ramayana and Buddha circuits.” Nepal and India have already reached agreements and understandings on developing these circuits.Similarly, the prime minister stated that the government is committed to making ambassadorial appointments more orderly, dignified, transparent, and performance-based. He also defended the government’s recent decision to recall Nepal’s ambassadors from several countries, stating that the decision was in line with the constitution.The recent decision to recall envoys from 11 nations created quite an uproar in various quarters.“The government is committed to using diplomatic missions and envoys in the best interest of the nation,” he said. “As per the Ambassador Appointment Directive, 2015, the envoys can be recalled before completing their terms, if necessary.”“Typically, only those appointed under political quota are recalled immediately after a change in coalition,” the prime minister said. “But this time, the envoys remained in their posts for more than three months after a change in the ruling coalition.”Dahal said this was proof of how the government was serious about the issue.Government picks some ambassadors under political quota based on recommendations from coalition partners while it selects some career diplomats from within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Talking about his recent India visit, Prime Minister Dahal also said that there were discussions on effective implementation of the agreements reached between the two South Asian neighbours.According to Dahal, among the issues discussed during a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, were strengthening Nepal-India relations, implementation of past agreements, and bilateral discussions—including border disputes. “There were serious discussions on the implementation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, Arun Hydropower Project and cooperation in the agricultural sector,” Dahal said.Likewise, the prime minister stated that the government has initiated the formation of a high-level committee to address the challenges being faced by cooperatives.After the committee’s input and suggestions, crisis-ridden cooperatives will be identified and action initiated to return deposits and manage their assets.Dahal said that more than Rs772.44 million has already been refunded to the victims of cooperatives.Addressing the meeting, Dahal stated that 59,587 individuals, affected by cooperatives, had filed complaints alleging embezzlement of deposits totalling Rs36.28 billion. Of this, the government has so far paid back Rs 772.44 million.The prime minister added that the government had declared 20 different cooperatives as ‘crisis-ridden’ and that the process of refunding affected depositors was being facilitated through the Crisis-ridden Cooperative Management Committee.Dahal also mentioned that efforts are underway for a separate legal procedure to establish an independent regulatory body to protect cooperative savings.“The government is aware of the problems faced by cooperatives and is serious about addressing them. Various efforts have been made to implement the suggestions of the high-level task force and agreements reached with the cooperative victims under the coordination of the National Planning Commission last year,” he said.Prime Minister Dahal said that a committee had also been formed at the provincial and local levels to solve the problems of those affected by cooperatives.A law to establish an authority to regulate and supervise large-scale cooperatives is also being drafted, Dahal said. “Not all cooperatives are in trouble. Many have helped lift people’s livelihoods while operating based on established international practices and as per the law,” Dahal said.He added that despite the significant increase in the number of cooperatives, there were plenty of shortcomings in their qualitative improvement.

They split the party protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice.Following a poor performance in the 2022 elections, where it failed even to secure the status of the national party, the CPN (Unified Socialist) is now struggling to retain party members. Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders are finding it difficult even to stop its members from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.Amid the diminishing influence, the party is gearing up for the general convention scheduled for June 30 to July 4 in Kathmandu.If the claims recently made by the leaders are anything to go by, the two former prime ministers—Nepal and Khanal—will face each other for the position of party chief during the general convention. Both of the leaders also led the CPN-UML in the past.Khanal on Monday emphasised the need of electing the party leadership through a consensus.While addressing the event to launch ‘Mahila Sankalpa-2’, which is the mouthpiece of the party’s women’s wing, All Nepal Women’s Association, Khanal stressed the need for a consensual election of the leaders. However, a certain criteria of leadership should be followed, Khanal said.“To strengthen the leadership within the party, we must select the leaders of the party through a consensus,” Khanal said during the programme. “Since our party was formed on the basis of an ideological ground, political direction, and certain policies and principles, we all should strive to maintain these values while selecting the leadership as well.”A party insider claimed that Khanal staked his claim for the top position as his political line was adopted in the political document to be presented in the general convention. Party general secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal prepared the political document to be presented in the general convention of the party. While in the UML, party chair Nepal embraced Madan Bhandari’s People’s Multi-party Democracy unconditionally for many years while Khanal and Bhusal viewed it critically. According to party leaders, Khanal and Bhusal have succeeded in including their ideas in the Unified Socialist’s official line.“In politics, the leaders whose policies prevail as the party’s official line should get the opportunity to lead the party,” a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Though the political document of the party is guided by the thoughts of general secretary Bhusal, Khanal also owns it, so he is claiming the leadership.”This does not mean that party chair Nepal has not owned the political document passed by the party's central committee, but the document is closer to the political line advocated by Bhusal and Khanal for a long time, said a party insider.Party chair Nepal, while addressing the same programme on Monday, also said that there are no differences among the leaders in terms of the party’s ideological line. “The preparation of the political, organisational and other documents to be presented in the upcoming congress is a collective effort of party leaders and cadres,” Nepal said.In addition to Nepal and Khanal, the party's general secretary Bhusal is also considering contesting for the party chair in the upcoming congress, though he has not publicly announced it yet.“Matters related to the aspiration of the leaders for the post of office bearers will be clear only after the selection of convention representatives,” Jeevan Ram Shrestha, the secretary of the party, told the Post. “Before the selection of the representatives, all things that have come from the media are mere speculation.”The party has decided to select general convention representatives from around the country on Wednesday. Shrestha said that the selection of representatives will make things clearer about the aspirants’ claims.Khanal has already opened his contact office at Baneshwar with a plan to manage his team’s activities during the general convention.Though Khanal has opened his contact office, he may or may not contest for the vital post, says another leader of the party who does not want to disclose his identity. The leader said that it might be under his publicity strategy. “If the political scenario is not in his favour, Khanal might back Bhusal for the leadership of the party to challenge Nepal,” the leader claimed. “On the other hand, Nepal, the present chair of the party, might also back Bhusal if he senses a tough challenge from Khanal.”Bhusal has remained tightlipped about his candidacy in view of the situation, a leader close to Bhusal said. “If the two top leaders decide to face each other, Bhusal might settle with his current position of general secretary.”The party’s deputy general secretaries, Jagan Nath Khatiwada and Parkash Jwala, have already announced their bid for the post of general secretary.The party will most likely select the leadership through consensus, says another leader. Meanwhile, there are voices in favour of continuing present chair Nepal in the position saying that he has put utmost efforts to establish the party after the split and sustain it amid a challenging situation. But there are also leaders who want Khanal’s leadership.“One of the two leaders will possibly lead the party,” Unified Socialist leader Som Prasad Pandey, who is close to Nepal, told the Post. “Though Bhusal’s name is also in the discussion for the post of chair, he is most likely to continue as the general secretary.”Meanwhile, former CPN-UML vice-chair Bhim Rawal, who has remained inactive in the UML after the party's convention held in November 2021 in Chitwan, is reportedly considering joining the Unified Socialist from the upcoming congress. In 2021, Rawal challenged Oli for the position of party chair despite Oli’s request not to do so. Since then, Rawal has been given no role in the UML.“Our party is in talks with Bhim Rawal to bring him to the party. We have already held two rounds of negotiation with him,” Shrestha, the secretary, told the Post. “If everything goes as planned, Rawal will join our party with a respectable position.”The Post’s attempts to contact Rawal to confirm Shrestha’s claim were unsuccessful. ","summary":"With the general convention of the CPN (Unified Socialist) approaching closer, top leaders of the party have intensified their preparations and lobbying for the top posts.As they expedite their lobbying through various informal channels, the party leaders in their formal speeches are emphasising the need of electing the leadership through a consensus.Senior leader Jhalanath Khanal did the same on Monday.A group of CPN-UML leaders led by Madhav Kumar Nepal, the party’s former chief, split the country’s largest communist party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) in August 2021. They split the party protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice.Following a poor performance in the 2022 elections, where it failed even to secure the status of the national party, the CPN (Unified Socialist) is now struggling to retain party members. Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders are finding it difficult even to stop its members from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.Amid the diminishing influence, the party is gearing up for the general convention scheduled for June 30 to July 4 in Kathmandu.If the claims recently made by the leaders are anything to go by, the two former prime ministers—Nepal and Khanal—will face each other for the position of party chief during the general convention. Both of the leaders also led the CPN-UML in the past.Khanal on Monday emphasised the need of electing the party leadership through a consensus.While addressing the event to launch ‘Mahila Sankalpa-2’, which is the mouthpiece of the party’s women’s wing, All Nepal Women’s Association, Khanal stressed the need for a consensual election of the leaders. However, a certain criteria of leadership should be followed, Khanal said.“To strengthen the leadership within the party, we must select the leaders of the party through a consensus,” Khanal said during the programme. “Since our party was formed on the basis of an ideological ground, political direction, and certain policies and principles, we all should strive to maintain these values while selecting the leadership as well.”A party insider claimed that Khanal staked his claim for the top position as his political line was adopted in the political document to be presented in the general convention. Party general secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal prepared the political document to be presented in the general convention of the party. While in the UML, party chair Nepal embraced Madan Bhandari’s People’s Multi-party Democracy unconditionally for many years while Khanal and Bhusal viewed it critically. According to party leaders, Khanal and Bhusal have succeeded in including their ideas in the Unified Socialist’s official line.“In politics, the leaders whose policies prevail as the party’s official line should get the opportunity to lead the party,” a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Though the political document of the party is guided by the thoughts of general secretary Bhusal, Khanal also owns it, so he is claiming the leadership.”This does not mean that party chair Nepal has not owned the political document passed by the party's central committee, but the document is closer to the political line advocated by Bhusal and Khanal for a long time, said a party insider.Party chair Nepal, while addressing the same programme on Monday, also said that there are no differences among the leaders in terms of the party’s ideological line. “The preparation of the political, organisational and other documents to be presented in the upcoming congress is a collective effort of party leaders and cadres,” Nepal said.In addition to Nepal and Khanal, the party's general secretary Bhusal is also considering contesting for the party chair in the upcoming congress, though he has not publicly announced it yet.“Matters related to the aspiration of the leaders for the post of office bearers will be clear only after the selection of convention representatives,” Jeevan Ram Shrestha, the secretary of the party, told the Post. “Before the selection of the representatives, all things that have come from the media are mere speculation.”The party has decided to select general convention representatives from around the country on Wednesday. Shrestha said that the selection of representatives will make things clearer about the aspirants’ claims.Khanal has already opened his contact office at Baneshwar with a plan to manage his team’s activities during the general convention.Though Khanal has opened his contact office, he may or may not contest for the vital post, says another leader of the party who does not want to disclose his identity. The leader said that it might be under his publicity strategy. “If the political scenario is not in his favour, Khanal might back Bhusal for the leadership of the party to challenge Nepal,” the leader claimed. “On the other hand, Nepal, the present chair of the party, might also back Bhusal if he senses a tough challenge from Khanal.”Bhusal has remained tightlipped about his candidacy in view of the situation, a leader close to Bhusal said. “If the two top leaders decide to face each other, Bhusal might settle with his current position of general secretary.”The party’s deputy general secretaries, Jagan Nath Khatiwada and Parkash Jwala, have already announced their bid for the post of general secretary.The party will most likely select the leadership through consensus, says another leader. Meanwhile, there are voices in favour of continuing present chair Nepal in the position saying that he has put utmost efforts to establish the party after the split and sustain it amid a challenging situation. But there are also leaders who want Khanal’s leadership.“One of the two leaders will possibly lead the party,” Unified Socialist leader Som Prasad Pandey, who is close to Nepal, told the Post. “Though Bhusal’s name is also in the discussion for the post of chair, he is most likely to continue as the general secretary.”Meanwhile, former CPN-UML vice-chair Bhim Rawal, who has remained inactive in the UML after the party's convention held in November 2021 in Chitwan, is reportedly considering joining the Unified Socialist from the upcoming congress. In 2021, Rawal challenged Oli for the position of party chair despite Oli’s request not to do so. Since then, Rawal has been given no role in the UML.“Our party is in talks with Bhim Rawal to bring him to the party. We have already held two rounds of negotiation with him,” Shrestha, the secretary, told the Post. “If everything goes as planned, Rawal will join our party with a respectable position.”The Post’s attempts to contact Rawal to confirm Shrestha’s claim were unsuccessful.

Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said.

The rupee’s fall is attributed to a steady depreciation of the Indian rupee, to which it is pegged.Experts say Nepal, an import-driven economy, may see a sharp rise in inflation due to the dollar's strength, as almost all goods and services are quoted in dollar terms.Commodities like edible oil, petroleum fuel, and foods are priced in dollars globally, so a stronger dollar adds to the cost of Nepali consumers.

Most festival goods, such as readymade clothes, shoes, bags, and accessories, are imported from China.According to media reports, the dollar strengthened as the Swiss National Bank delivered an interest-rate cut, underscoring the divergence in monetary policies among global central banks as the US Federal Reserve delayed easing policy.

Nepal has been following a pegged exchange rate system with the Indian rupee.Nepal adopts a different kind of exchange rate system for other convertible currencies.In line with the economic liberalisation policy introduced in the mid-1980s, Nepal introduced current account convertibility in 1993, effectively pegging the Nepali rupee to the Indian rupee at the rate of 1.60, the same rate as in 1960 when the two currencies were first pegged. Since 1993, the exchange rate of the Nepali rupee with other convertible currencies has been market-determined in line with the exchange rate of the Indian rupee with convertible currencies.A strong US dollar has both advantages and disadvantages for a country like Nepal. It benefits some but negatively impacts others.According to Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of Nepal Rastra Bank, the depreciation of the domestic currency could exert pressure on the balance of payments as Nepal would have to spend more money to buy foreign goods.According to him, the depreciation of the domestic currency is likely to worsen inflation, as the country is highly dependent on imported goods and has low domestic output.“The currency’s devaluation makes exports cheaper, measured in foreign currency, and imports become more expensive, measured in the home currency.”The price effect may lead the goods and services sector of Nepal to weaken, said Karki. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, in the first ten months of the current fiscal year, merchandise exports decreased by 3.6 percent to Rs126.17 billion.However, merchandise imports amounted to a staggering Rs1.30 trillion in the review period.The most significant impact will be on purchasing petroleum products, Nepal’s biggest import, on which the country is fully dependent. It will also impact the cost of chemical fertiliser.On the other hand, the appreciation of the US dollar can benefit remittance earners.

Visitors from abroad will find the prices of goods and services in Nepal cheaper with a stronger dollar.Travel income, the money spent by foreigners, increased 35 percent to Rs69.41 billion in the first ten months of the current fiscal year.The strong dollar increases the burden of debt repayment in local currency terms.Thus, as the dollar becomes stronger relative to other currencies, these repayments become more expensive in terms of the domestic currency.The price of gold also increases in the local market when the dollar rises.The Nepali currency vis-à-vis the US dollar depreciated 1.61 percent in mid-May 2024 from mid-July 2023, while it had depreciated 2.79 percent in the same period of the previous year.

Visitors from abroad will find the prices of goods and services in Nepal cheaper with a stronger dollar.Travel income, the money spent by foreigners, increased 35 percent to Rs69.41 billion in the first ten months of the current fiscal year.The strong dollar increases the burden of debt repayment in local currency terms.Thus, as the dollar becomes stronger relative to other currencies, these repayments become more expensive in terms of the domestic currency.The price of gold also increases in the local market when the dollar rises.The Nepali currency vis-à-vis the US dollar depreciated 1.61 percent in mid-May 2024 from mid-July 2023, while it had depreciated 2.79 percent in the same period of the previous year.

Now, she doesn't need the high dose of medicines like in the past. ”This was a common refrain among a few patients, who took doctors' advice seriously, changed their lifestyles and eating habits, joined yoga classes, and increased physical activity, which helped them control high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Public health experts say changing eating habits, lessening body weight, and starting physical activities, including yoga and physical exercises, help control non-communicable diseases, which have emerged as a major public health problem in Nepal.Studies show that non-communicable diseases have emerged as a serious public health issue in Nepal, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption—and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity. Doctors warn that non-communicable diseases—hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others—could lead to a public health crisis if not addressed immediately.

The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.The report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, but progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.The report shows that exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining, from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent last year. Health officials said that studies show that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies.According to the report, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing mothers’ education, from 12 percent among those whose mothers have no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile at 46 percent and lowest in the lowest quintile at 11 percent.Likewise, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province at 11 percent, in Madhesh Province at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province at 43 percent.Exclusive breastfeeding is the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and the lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.“We have allocated the nutrition budget to launch a nationwide awareness drive about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the upcoming fiscal year,” said Thapa. “We have also designated a nutrition focal person at every local unit who is tasked to discourage practices of promoting replacement feeding.”The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared with 12 percent of those born at home. Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children, according to the World Health Organisation.Health ministry officials hoped that training for nurses and paramedics would help lessen bottle-feeding practices in health facilities.Doctors say breastfeeding should continue for the first two years or beyond, as breast milk lowers children’s risk of illness, promotes their recovery during illness, and remains an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022.

The Nepal Demographic Health Survey-2022 and a report of the Ministry of Health and Population suggest the same.Improvements in water and sanitation conditions, personal hygiene and awareness levels are credited with the decline in infection from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoeal infections.“A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices,” reads a report by the Nepal Statistics Office.Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health concern usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. It is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, also showed that 10 percent of children under 5 have diarrhoea. The prevalence of diarrhoea is highest among children aged 6-11 months at 18 percent, followed by 13 percent each among those aged 12–23 months and less than six months.Public health experts say the decline in open defecation, the general public’s behavioural change towards hygienic practice, and an increase in literacy and education levels could have also contributed to a decline in diarrhoeal infections.“Decline in open defecation, rise in education and awareness levels, behavioural changes, improvement in water and sanitation conditions play an important role in cutting the burden of diarrhoeal infections,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “We can see a lot of changes in these things, but at the same time, we should not forget that sources of drinking water are still problematic in many places, including in the capital city.”According to the NDHS report, advice or treatment was sought for 57 percent of children who had diarrhoea in the two weeks preceding the survey, down from 64 percent in 2016.The report also shows that the percentage of diarrhoeal infection is lower among those with an unimproved source of drinking water at 4 percent than among those with an improved source at 11 percent.Experts say that so-called improved sources of drinking water are still not safe to drink.“E.coli and coliform-like hazardous microbes get detected in most water resources, including in the samples of bottled water,” Pun said. “We must be more cautious while drinking water, as the monsoon season has just started and most water sources get contaminated with floodwaters.”Earlier in March, drinking water samples collected from public taps and community schools in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur were found to be contaminated with faecal coliform.Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. Its presence means that the drinking water being used by locals of Godawari is contaminated with sewage.The Ministry of Health and Population’s annual report for the fiscal year 2022-23 also shows a three-fold decline in diarrhoeal infections. According to the report, the national incidence rate of diarrhoea was 115 per 1,000 under-five children in 2022-23 compared to 365 in the fiscal year 2021-22.The ministry’s report showed four under-five deaths from diarrhoeal infection in the fiscal year 2022-23 compared to 34 deaths in 2021-22.Of the four deaths that occurred in the fiscal year 2022-23, one each was recorded in Bagmati, Madhesh, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with no reported diarrhoeal death in Lumbini, Koshi, and Gandaki provinces.Contrary to the NDHS, the health ministry’s report shows that Karnali Province had the highest incidence of diarrhoea—216, followed by Lumbini Province’s 161. The lowest incidence was reported in Bagmati Province at 78.According to the World Health Organisation, diarrhoea is the second leading cause of mortality in children under five. The disease has also been linked with growth and cognitive shortfalls in children, especially in marginalised communities.Doctors say the only ways to prevent people from dying of water-borne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection.

The prevalence of diarrhoea is highest among children aged 6-11 months at 18 percent, followed by 13 percent each among those aged 12–23 months and less than six months.Public health experts say the decline in open defecation, the general public’s behavioural change towards hygienic practice, and an increase in literacy and education levels could have also contributed to a decline in diarrhoeal infections.“Decline in open defecation, rise in education and awareness levels, behavioural changes, improvement in water and sanitation conditions play an important role in cutting the burden of diarrhoeal infections,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “We can see a lot of changes in these things, but at the same time, we should not forget that sources of drinking water are still problematic in many places, including in the capital city.”According to the NDHS report, advice or treatment was sought for 57 percent of children who had diarrhoea in the two weeks preceding the survey, down from 64 percent in 2016.The report also shows that the percentage of diarrhoeal infection is lower among those with an unimproved source of drinking water at 4 percent than among those with an improved source at 11 percent.Experts say that so-called improved sources of drinking water are still not safe to drink.“E.coli and coliform-like hazardous microbes get detected in most water resources, including in the samples of bottled water,” Pun said. “We must be more cautious while drinking water, as the monsoon season has just started and most water sources get contaminated with floodwaters.”Earlier in March, drinking water samples collected from public taps and community schools in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur were found to be contaminated with faecal coliform.Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. Its presence means that the drinking water being used by locals of Godawari is contaminated with sewage.The Ministry of Health and Population’s annual report for the fiscal year 2022-23 also shows a three-fold decline in diarrhoeal infections. According to the report, the national incidence rate of diarrhoea was 115 per 1,000 under-five children in 2022-23 compared to 365 in the fiscal year 2021-22.The ministry’s report showed four under-five deaths from diarrhoeal infection in the fiscal year 2022-23 compared to 34 deaths in 2021-22.Of the four deaths that occurred in the fiscal year 2022-23, one each was recorded in Bagmati, Madhesh, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with no reported diarrhoeal death in Lumbini, Koshi, and Gandaki provinces.Contrary to the NDHS, the health ministry’s report shows that Karnali Province had the highest incidence of diarrhoea—216, followed by Lumbini Province’s 161. The lowest incidence was reported in Bagmati Province at 78.According to the World Health Organisation, diarrhoea is the second leading cause of mortality in children under five. The disease has also been linked with growth and cognitive shortfalls in children, especially in marginalised communities.Doctors say the only ways to prevent people from dying of water-borne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection.

As there is no specific treatment for dengue, officials said they are planning to train doctors to provide supportive care to seriously ailing dengue patients.“We have been working to train doctors serving at state-run health facilities to treat dengue patients,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We hope the training will help doctors manage cases more effectively.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,175 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 122. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, increasing numbers of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as the outbreak of the virus is reported every month including in the winter months.Health authorities in Nepal claimed that lessons from managing Covid cases would help them combat other outbreaks, but the massive infections and spread of the dengue virus before the onset of the monsoon cast doubt on these claims.“Every year, scores die and hundreds of thousands get infected from the dengue virus, but no agency in the country is doing much on disease prevention,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “There are three tiers of government in the country, and the relevant agency in each government—federal, provincial and local—shifts responsibility to another. When you ask the agency under the local level, they say they are not there to kill mosquitoes.”Experts say health authorities have done little to cut down on the risks, except counting the number of infected people and issuing statements. The public, too, has become less vigilant about dengue infections, they sayAccording to entomologists, reducing the spread of the dengue virus is impossible without coordinated efforts from all relevant agencies and individuals.“Several preemptive measures, including a search-and-destroy campaign of mosquito breeding sites, are necessary to curb the spread of the virus,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “People should be made aware of the risks, so awareness drives should be launched. Authorities should deploy community workers to inspect households to find and destroy mosquito breeding grounds.”Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.

They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development.

According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

Against these types of opponents, if you don’t find a goal in the first minutes everything becomes harder.”Portugal started sharply and were unfazed by the deafening whistles from Turkey’s supporters when in possession, with Ronaldo drawing an easy save from Bayindir inside two minutes.Turkey — who had lost all three of their previous European Championship games against Portugal without scoring — set up more defensively after they gave up multiple chances to tournament debutants Georgia in their opening match.They nonetheless often played out from the back and the gamble almost paid off after 20 minutes, but 41-year-old defender Pepe’s last-man challenge stopped Orkun Kokcu from breaking clear.Portugal scored shortly after through a quick break down the left, when Mendes played a dangerous ball across goal which Silva turned home for his first major tournament goal in his 15th game at either the World Cup or European Championship.A defensive mix-up doubled their lead when Bayindir, who was in the side for Mert Gunok, wandered out of his goal to collect a misplaced pass from Joao Cancelo towards Ronaldo.But, as Ronaldo and Cancelo remonstrated, Akaydin played a no-look backpass which rolled past Bayindir in slow motion and evaded Zeki Celik's desperate slide to cross the line.Kerem Akturkoglu forced a great save from Diogo Costa almost immediately after, but Turkey otherwise created precious few chances.The second half started in subdued fashion before substitute Ruben Neves played a long pass over the top, which fell to Ronaldo who had the goal at his mercy.Portugal’s captain instead laid the ball on a plate for Fernandes to score the simplest of goals, giving Ronaldo the most European Championship assists to go with his records for goals and appearances in the tournament.Portugal boss Roberto Martinez described Ronaldo’s decision to provide an assist rather than go for goal himself as “a pure moment of Portugese football”.“That’s an example that should be shown in every academy,” he added.The game petered out even after Turkey boss Vincenzo Montella introduced teenage star Arda Guler, who had scored the decisive goal in Turkey’s opening game but started on the bench due to concerns over his fitness.Turkey pressed late on for a goal that would not have changed the result but would have improved their goal difference, which could prove crucial if they lose to the Czech Republic and need to qualify from third place.But the end of the match was marred by several pitch invaders, all of whom made a beeline for a selfie with Ronaldo — who appeared to pose for a picture with the first, but became increasingly frustrated with stoppages to the game.

Palestinians said a tank shell hit a tent housing displaced families.“Two tanks climbed a hilltop overseeing Mawasi and they sent balls of fire that hit the tents of the poor people displaced in the area,” one resident told Reuters over a chat app.The Israeli military said that the incident was under review. “An initial inquiry conducted suggests that there is no indication that a strike was carried out by the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi,” it said.Earlier, the military said its forces were conducting “precise, intelligence-based” actions in the Rafah area, where troops were involved in close-quarter combat and had located tunnels used by militants.Over the past week, the military said, troops targeted a university that served as a Hamas headquarters from which militants fired on soldiers and found weapons and barrel bombs. It did not name the university.In the central Gaza area of Nusseirat, the military said soldiers killed dozens of militants over the past week and found a weapons depot containing mortar bombs and military equipment belonging to Hamas.Some residents said the Israeli onslaught on Rafah had intensified in the previous two days and that the sounds of explosions and gunfire had hardly stopped.“Last night was one of the worst nights in western Rafah: Drones, planes, tanks, and naval boats bombarded the area. We feel the occupation is trying to complete the control of the city,” said Hatem, 45, reached by text message.“They are taking heavy strikes from the resistance fighters, which may be slowing them down.”STRIKES ON KHAN YOUNIS AND GAZA CITYMore than eight months into the war in Gaza, Israel’s advance is now focused on the two last areas its forces had yet to seize: Rafah on Gaza’s southern edge and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre.“The entire city of Rafah is an area of Israeli military operations,” Ahmed Al-Sofi, the mayor of Rafah, said in a statement carried by Hamas media on Friday.“The city is living through a humanitarian catastrophe and people are dying inside their tents because of Israeli bombardment.”Sofi said no medical facility was functioning in the city, and that remaining residents and displaced families lacked the minimum daily needs of food and water.Palestinian and UN figures show that fewer than 100,000 people may have remained in the far western side of the city, which had been sheltering more than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people before the Israeli assault began in early May.In nearby Khan Younis, an Israeli air strike on Friday killed three people, including a father and son, medics said.In parallel, Israeli forces continued a new push back into some Gaza City suburbs in the north of the enclave, where they fought with Hamas-led militants.On Friday, an Israeli air strike on a Gaza City municipal facility killed five people, including four municipal workers, the territory’s Civil Emergency Service said. Rescue teams were searching the rubble for more missing victims.In the nearby Beach camp, an Israeli air strike on a house killed at least seven people, medics said.Palestinian health officials said at least 45 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Friday.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its Gaza office was damaged when heavy-calibre projectiles landed nearby, in an area where hundreds of displaced Palestinians are living in tents.“This grave security incident is one of several in recent days; previously stray bullets have reached ICRC structures,” the organization said in a post on X on Friday.“We decry these incidents that put the lives of humanitarians and civilians at risk.”Israel’s ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute.The United Nations said on Friday it is Israel’s responsibility - as the occupying power in the Gaza Strip - to restore public order and safety in the Palestinian territory so humanitarian aid can be delivered, amid warnings of imminent famine.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while.

After winning 303 seats in 2019, Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party dropped to 240 seats, forcing it to form a coalition with other political parties to govern.This development has raised questions about how Modi will govern moving forward. Modi has developed a cult following through his Hindu nationalist agenda, but his key coalition partners do not share his extreme nationalist outlook.Some commentators have suggested Modi will have to moderate his divisive rhetoric, which has been criticised for dehumanising religious minorities and government critics.However, early signs suggest that Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party will continue pushing his brand of authoritarian populism, undermining human rights and freedom of expression in the process.The prosecution of Arundhati RoySoon after Modi’s re-election, Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and Bharatiya Janata Party member Vinai Kumar Saxena confirmed that the prosecution of prominent Indian writer and political activist Arundhati Roy, first proposed in 2023, will proceed.Roy is known internationally as the Booker Prize winning author of The God of Small Things. Along with human rights scholar Sheikh Showkat Hussain, she has been charged under anti-terrorism legislation.The charges concern “provocative” speeches Roy and Hussain delivered at a conference in 2010. In her speech, Roy argued that Kashmir was not a part of India. This has led the government to charge Roy under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for promoting separatist causes.Violating rights at home and abroadThis prosecution—14 years later—may seem unusual, but it is not an isolated incident. In the broader context of Modi’s rule, Roy’s prosecution represents business as usual.Since the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014, Modi has pushed a Hindu ultra-nationalist ideology that does not tolerate dissent. Claiming Hinduism represents India’s “true” identity, Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party nationalists have targeted religious minorities and government critics, labelling them as threats to India.People who have spoken out against Modi’s rule have been subjected to serious human rights abuses.

Police and nationalists have subjected minorities and government critics to violence and sexual assault with impunity. Protesters have had their houses bulldozed as punishment. News organisations have been raided.Critics of Modi’s government are not safe overseas, either. The Indian government has been accused of transnational repression, where a government harasses and even kills opponents in other countries.Journalists and human rights activists have had their Overseas Citizenship of India and their passports revoked.

This would require the State Department to identify India as a country that has “engaged in severe violations of religious freedom”. Despite the recommendation, this has not yet been done.Why prosecute now?Prosecuting critics under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act has become a common strategy. Adopted in the 1960s, and revised several times since, the act has been heavily criticised by human rights authorities, on the grounds that it is vague and undermines legal safeguards. It has become a key tool used to punish anyone who speaks out against the Indian government.The decision to proceed with the prosecution of Roy and Hussain could be interpreted as a way for the Bharatiya Janata Party to show its continued relevance after losing so many parliamentary seats. According to Siddhartha Deb, prosecuting Roy is a means for Modi to show his “rabid attack dogs of Hindu nationalism” that his agenda will continue as usual.Roy has been a critic of Modi’s Hindu-nationalist agenda since he took power.

The debate on 13A—an amendment to the Sri Lankan constitution to implement the understanding between India and Sri Lanka to resolve what was then a decade-old Tamil insurgency, has never been outdated. It was reported that JS Jayewardene, the then President of Sri Lanka, compelled the legislators belonging to his party, the United National Party, to vote in favour of this amendment. This led to a severe difference between him and the then Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who were fighting for a separate homeland, did not accept this 13A-created, truncated Provincial Council (PC). It resumed the fight against the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) that was deployed as a part of the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord. Premadasa, whose only objective was to remove the IPKF, armed them. The IPKF returned to India in 1990 after Premadasa became president. While this became a lesson for India, an LTTE suicide bomber killed Premadasa in the May Day rally. Rest is history.Yet, this truncated power of PCs has been at the centre of debates in all Presidential elections in Sri Lanka since the 1990s. In 2013, there was an attempt to abolish the PCs, but the Mahinda Rajapakse government did not get the support of all the PCs. His party could not pass the proposal in the Central Provincial Council ruled by his party. While the Tamils who believe in a negotiated settlement of the ethnic issue do not see PC as a solution, 13A is seen as the bottom line of any devolution after the elimination of LTTE in the final leg of counterinsurgency in 2009.13A and 13A plusPost-war, Mahinda Rajapakse, who said he would go beyond 13A—popularly known as 13A plus, a solution to the long pending ethnic crisis—reneged on his promise and started to label 13A as foreign-imposed and promised a “home-grown” solution. The solution appeared to be the economic development of the North—building roads, infrastructure, government, etc., with a government-piloted ethnic reconciliation that encouraged the Tamils and the Sinhalese to spend time with each other’s families. Yet, the majority Sinhalese population and clergy were against any ethnic accommodation, as the LTTE lost the war; thus, the Tamils lost their fight. Devolution was a much-abused word. For the Tamils, it was a partial fulfilment of their political aspiration; for the Sinhalese, it meant eventual secession, and any demand by the Tamils meant “re-emergence of the idea of Tamil Eelam”. The post-war Tamil community was under intense surveillance by security forces. They were not allowed to mourn their families and relatives killed in the last phase of the war as that was tantamount to mourning “terrorists”.Militarisation of the North continued even after the defeat of the LTTE. The Sinhala Buddhist colonisation with the patronage of the Army started in the Tamil-dominated North of Sri Lanka. Buddha’s statues were placed under the Bodhi tree to reclaim the Sinhala heritage of the North and to deny exclusivity to Tamils’ presence in this area. In the changed circumstances, devolution was Tamils’ only hope. President Rajapakse established the Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) to discuss 13A and suggest addressing political grievances. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), a coalition of five Tamil parties that represented the Tamils, refused to be part of the PSC as they realised this was a ploy to reject their demands given the majoritarian composition. Similarly, the main opposition, the United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lankan Muslim Congress, opposed any dilution of 13A. Yet since 1987, slowly and steadily, the limited powers of PCs eroded further. For example, in 1992, President Premadasa brought district Secretary Gram Sevaks and government agents in the province under the control of the government in Colombo. Later, the Supreme Court demerged the North and East provinces and considered the “traditional homeland of Tamils” as the merger under the 1987 Accord was not followed by a referendum. No Sri Lankan politician can ignore the Sinhala Buddhist sentiments and think of winning the election. Several proposals—the devolution proposal of Chandrika Kumaratunge, the 2000 draft constitution and Mangala Moonasinghe’s report—also recommended devolution of power.Given the Indian pressure post-war, the government decided to hold an election to the Northern Provincial Council after 25 years. Interestingly, some posters pasted before the PC election asked voters whether they wanted to choose guns, indirectly telling the voters that victory of the TNA would mean the return of violence. The party won overwhelmingly, and Chief Minister CV Wigneswaran, former justice, strongly advocated 13A and said it was the only pact out of several signed between the Tamils and governments that had survived due to India’s backing. As the government in Colombo was not in the mood to implement 13A, some of the constituent parties of the TNA took a hardline stand. In Sri Lanka, the debate is about the full implementation of the 13th Amendment, and it has not progressed beyond that point because scuttling the power of PCs is always on the cards to satisfy the majoritarian impulse. While the Northern Province has highlighted the importance of giving the police and land power to the provinces, other PC chief Ministers have towed their party line.Fast-forwardIn 2016, the presidential election resulted in Maithripala Sirisena’s election to office after defeating Mahinda Rajapakse. Several reforms were proposed by the unity government, also known as the Yahapalana government. However, given the vocal ultra-nationalist opposition to the Provincial Council, the Constitutional Reform Committee could not make any moves. For example: The reform committee suggested including the Sinhala words aekiya raajya and orumiththa nadu in Tamil to signify the country’s unitary status. Some even suggested the insertion of ‘undivided and indivisible’ to ally the unfounded fear of secession of Tamils through devolution. The fear is politically propagated and sustained by nationalist politicians like the National Freedom Front (NFF), Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU), Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP), JHU and also some Army veterans close to former President Gotabaya Rajapakse.India has always insisted on the full implementation of 13A and the need to hold PC elections. The current president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, also supports this proposal as a way out of the current impasse over 13A. In his tour to the Northern Provinces, he reiterated his position on fully implementing the amendment. Not to be left out, Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB), also a Presidential aspirant, said that if voted to power, he will execute 13A. As the presidential election nears, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna of the Rajapakses, which is yet to announce its presidential candidate, is weighing its options as the ultra-nationalist parties supported by Buddhist clergy are rallying against the implementation of any devolution. This re-emergence of 13A in the political debate as the presidential election nears is not new. At the same time, all political parties know that the support of Tamils would make a difference. While the Tamil political parties remain divided over the nature of the political solution, the Sinhala nationalists want to remove the 13th Amendment. Between these two extremes—no devolution and 13A plus—it is merry-go-round on the crucial question of Tamil political aspiration in Sri Lanka. ","summary":"While discussing and debating the forthcoming Sri Lankan Presidential election scheduled for September 2024 and the implementation of the 13th Amendment, I asked my journalist friend Bala, who has spent more than two decades in that country, “What is new?”“Pat,” he replied, “It is a merry-go-round.” Indeed, it is. The debate on 13A—an amendment to the Sri Lankan constitution to implement the understanding between India and Sri Lanka to resolve what was then a decade-old Tamil insurgency, has never been outdated. It was reported that JS Jayewardene, the then President of Sri Lanka, compelled the legislators belonging to his party, the United National Party, to vote in favour of this amendment. This led to a severe difference between him and the then Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who were fighting for a separate homeland, did not accept this 13A-created, truncated Provincial Council (PC). It resumed the fight against the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) that was deployed as a part of the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord. Premadasa, whose only objective was to remove the IPKF, armed them. The IPKF returned to India in 1990 after Premadasa became president. While this became a lesson for India, an LTTE suicide bomber killed Premadasa in the May Day rally. Rest is history.Yet, this truncated power of PCs has been at the centre of debates in all Presidential elections in Sri Lanka since the 1990s. In 2013, there was an attempt to abolish the PCs, but the Mahinda Rajapakse government did not get the support of all the PCs. His party could not pass the proposal in the Central Provincial Council ruled by his party.

But at the same time, it has sent an unmistakable message to the world: “We have arrived!”Nepal technically did not win any of the group stage matches at the world cup. The only point it got was through a draw with Sri Lanka after rain forced the match to be abandoned. The match with Sri Lanka was certainly the most anticipated considering how they were a relatively weaker team in the group and Nepal had a great chance of getting both the points. But Nepal was not out there looking for the weakest. Rather, it was there to take on the strongest cricketing giants. In the other three matches—against the Netherlands, South Africa and Bangladesh—Nepal gave its opponents ample evidence of its arrival on the global cricketing scene. The most electric performance, of course, was against South Africa when Nepal lost by just a run. But even in the narrow loss, it won plenty of hearts and accolades, having forced a top Test cricket-playing nation ranked third in one-day internationals and fifth in T20 internationals to run for its money. Neither could the Netherlands and Bangladesh take Nepal for granted. What was equally gratifying was the forceful presence of Nepali cricket fans cheering for Team Nepal. The Nepali fans did not only fill the stadiums from Texas to Florida to St. Vincent, they cheered on even as their team lost. This was not just due to a strengthening spirit of sportsmanship but also the confidence that we are rising and rising as a cricketing nation. At home, though, there is still a lot of work to do. The men in blue and red might want to work on their batting skills, for that is where we flattered the most this time. After assessing their World Cup odyssey, captain Rohit Paudel and coach Monty Desai will certainly sit down to work out a new plan of action, and we must have faith in their leadership—after all, Nepali cricket hasn’t been as consistently strong as it is under them. What we need immediately is investment in infrastructure. We do not even have a single stadium with floodlights, let alone proper stands and toilets for the spectators. The stadium in Kirtipur is rustic and amateurish at best; the one in Mulpani is taking ages to complete although it has been used for some tournaments; and the one in Bharatpur that has been partially built by the Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation has a long way to go before it comes into operation. Moreover, our players have limited exposure to even regional cricket although we live at the nervecentre of the cricketing world—South Asia. Nepal must take the initiative to invite regional cricketing powerhouses such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for friendly and competitive matches so that our players get greater exposure. We have seen how Afghanistan has risen as the dark horse of cricket in just a few years with the right kind of regional support, mainly India.

The government’s 10 percent tax hike on electric vehicles (EVs) for the fiscal year 2024-25 comes as a tight slap to the country’s commitment to EV-based mobility by 2030—at a time green transport systems across the country feel ever more important. For this or that reason, consumers here are obliged to line up for a whole day, if not days, to fill up their motor tanks. In a recent case, the underpaid fuel station workers halted fuel supply to private dealers and thronged the state-run stations in Kathmandu. These occurrences are here to stay, reminding us of the need to take the EV transition seriously. It is widely known that promoting EVs offers multiple benefits. The transition to electric vehicles in Nepal will not only reduce vehicular emissions and clean the air but also discourage the country’s overreliance on fossil fuels, which account for more than 17 percent of the total import bill. This shift, in turn, can help us leverage our under-tapped hydropower potential to build charging stations and export electricity to the two closest neighbours transitioning to green policies. EVs are costly to install, and concerns about insufficient charging stations in Nepal remain, but they are still more efficient and cost-effective than petrol or diesel vehicles. Nepal will also benefit from increased climate funds in the long run if we successfully make air breathable by cutting vehicular emissions through EV adoption. After all, Nepal must have a moral ground and track record of actions to negotiate for these funds and can’t always fall back on the excuse of the country’s negligible contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. What policymakers seem to be overlooking is the urgency of EV adoption. Their plans and policies on electric vehicles are ambiguous as, on the one hand, they pledge a green energy future while, on the other, they agree on building oil pipeline projects with India. Moreover, they always set ambitious goals and fail to achieve them. For instance, by introducing the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in 2016, the government aimed to increase the share of EVs to 20 percent of all passenger vehicles; however, by 2020, only 1 percent were electric. Now, when people are more interested in buying these green wheels due to the tax cut on EVs last year, the new tax increment is bound to affect their choices. These developments are setbacks to meeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 and decarbonising the transport sector by 2030.It’s high time to come up with clear policies on green growth and execute interventions that wholeheartedly support electric vehicles. This includes installing charging stations and finding ways to sustain them by emulating international practices on repurposing, recycling and managing used batteries. Many organisations, donor agencies and development partners are extending their hand to Nepal in this effort. Failing to establish clear strategies and imposing tax restrictions could mean missing out on the benefits these agencies can provide and the overall change electric vehicles can bring to Nepal. The green energy goal is worth pursuing collectively, as no less than the future of humanity depends on it.

It is hard to make the local representatives responsible when they see that their party bosses at the centre are even more unaccountable and unreliable.  "},{"hash":"613bcf827b4fa6516f019f8f85eaa0ebaec9396b8097931ce1726818aa2ada29","title":"let-s-tango-together","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/16/let-s-tango-together","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/Down1694441792-1718547682.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718496000000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"Nepali prime ministers, irrespective of their political affiliation, have over the years tried to cultivate the best of relations with New Delhi. Given the multifaceted nature of Nepal-India ties, the open border and Nepal’s heavy trade reliance on the southern neighbour, iffy relations with India can make life difficult for the Nepali head of government. There is also a corollary to this hard reality. Whenever the Nepali leader feels New Delhi is unhappy with him, he will invariably make an overture to the other neighbour, China. In the eyes of top Nepali leaders, China has always been seen as the power whose good graces can give them legitimacy as true nationalists. So they at least have to make a show of promoting ties with Beijing. This also helps keep New Delhi honest. To sum up, for most Nepali leaders, China is worth cultivating only to the extent of boosting their nationalist credentials. The issues of national interest are often the least of their concern. Nepal and China have vastly increased bilateral engagements in the post-pandemic period. On June 25, the two countries are to meet for a foreign secretary-level talks. Before that, the Joint Expert Group will sit to sort out boundary-related matters. Many outstanding issues will be discussed in the pair of meetings, from trade, transit, connectivity, investment, health, tourism, poverty alleviation, disaster management, education, culture to people-to-people exchanges. To make discussions more substantive, the Nepali side has requested China that the current bilateral mechanism at foreign secretary-level be elevated to the level of foreign ministers. That makes sense. It is also in the interest of both the sides to quickly settle outstanding border disputes, just like they amicably settled the dispute on height of Mt Everest back in 2020. Other nagging suspicions also need to be cleared up. For instance, the Chinese say there is no environment for their contractors and workers to work in Nepal, which in turn accounts for delays in various projects. Yet Nepali officials maintain that it is the Chinese who are, for instance, inexplicably delaying expansion and maintenance of several road projects and in handing over the detailed project report of the second phase of the Kathmandu Ring Road.While Nepali leaders have been guilty of playing the ‘China card’, the Chinese too have appeared less than enthusiastic on improving bilateral ties. The cooperation on the BRI has stalled, largely because of differences over funding modality, with Nepal wanting more grants and the Chinese pushing for more loans. Yet there would be fewer differences if there was greater transparency on China’s part, which is missing in, say, the Chinese funding of the Pokhara International Airport. Instead of trying to clear the air on these issues through bilateral channels, the Chinese have taken to social media with gusto. This suggests a gap in communication between official channels of the two countries. If Nepal-China relations are to progress and mature, ways must be found to reduce this gap. Our leaders’ reduction of China as a counterweight to India and a tool to burnish their nationalist credentials is as harmful as the new wolf warrior diplomacy of the Chinese diplomats. In order to improve ties, what the two countries should do is try to better understand each other while also respecting their differences—not just in their speeches but also in reality.    ","summary":"Nepali prime ministers, irrespective of their political affiliation, have over the years tried to cultivate the best of relations with New Delhi.

In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded.

Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces.

The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.

After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.

During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  ","summary":"Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour.

The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. ","summary":"The CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress.

However, despite this early arrival, the monsoon has not advanced beyond a few districts of the Koshi Province even after nine days.“Generally, it takes two days for the monsoon to reach the Kathmandu Valley after entering eastern Nepal,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecasting Division. “This year, we have not yet issued a second release about the monsoon progress.”Met officials and locals from Western Nepal, especially those in the Tarai districts, hoped for relief from the scorching heat. They expected that monsoon rains would arrive within days after entering the eastern part of the country. However, the monsoon clouds did not advance from the Koshi Province until Wednesday evening, leaving people struggling with the scorching heat. Maximum temperatures in several districts of western Nepal have remained over 40 degrees Celsius for the last several weeks, making daily life difficult, especially for the poor people who have to work outdoors during daytime to make ends meet.Badly affected by the heatwave, several schools in the districts have extended their leave. On Wednesday, Dhangadhi recorded 42.3 degree Celsius, followed by Nepalgunj 41.5, Birendranagar 40.1, Dipayal 40.2 degree Celsius. Kathmandu recorded 30.6 degree Celsius, according to the met office.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year southwest monsoon entered Nepal on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than the normal onset day. A normal monsoon, supported by the timely arrival of rain, translates into favourable agricultural production, mainly of paddy, and is further linked with the country’s overall economic growth.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts for 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.According to Manandhar, the easterly wind that brought monsoon rainfall in eastern Nepal is not strong enough to displace the westerly winds. Some places in Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces have been witnessing rainfall for the last couple of days, but this is caused by the local system, western disturbances, and low-pressure areas developed in Bihar, India.“We will issue the next bulletin in a couple of days to inform the public about the monsoon’s progress,” said Manandhar. “As the weather is unpredictable, so is the monsoon rainfall.”Met officials said that the early onset of the monsoon rain doesn't ensure early progress across the country.Last year it took three weeks for the monsoon to spread all over the country. “Sometimes, it spreads within two days,” said Manandhar.The Met Office has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events, such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.The department’s climate section has issued a weather forecast for four months, from June to September. It said most parts of the country are likely to experience above-average minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall due to weakened El Nino conditions and the development of La Nina conditions.El Nino refers to climatic patterns where ocean surface temperatures warm unusually. La Nina is the opposite where the ocean surface cools off.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by the monsoon this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly impacted, and 18,000 families will require rescue due to monsoon-related disasters.
