Officially launched in 2007 as an initiative of the Oxford-based International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP), NepJOL is now managed by the Central Library of Tribhuvan University. In its self-description, NepJOL is “a database of journals published in Nepal, covering the full range of academic disciplines.” Its primary objective “is to give greater visibility to the participating journals, and to the research they convey….by hosting their content online.” NepJOL now showcases over 400 Nepali journals. Many of these journals are dedicated to natural sciences, medical sciences, engineering and management. There is a sizable number of other journals which publish research in the social sciences and the humanities. Not all of these journals are “alive,” meaning new issues of some of them have not been published for years. However, they have not yet been declared “defunct” by their erstwhile editors. The portal provides general information about each journal. When new issues are uploaded, readers can read their table of contents and find the full texts of the published articles. In the case of many journals, the readers will also be able to access some or all of their back issues. As I have written elsewhere at great length, there are many reasons why the number of academic journals published from Nepal has increased massively since 1990. To put it briefly, the expansion of higher education across the country, especially the growth in the number of MA and above degree programmes in different Nepali universities, is an important factor fuelling this growth. The journals have become platforms to publish the research work of both graduate students and the faculty teaching them. In addition, this growth is also partially linked to the ways in which faculty performance is now evaluated in our universities. This growth also coincides with an increase in the professional differentiation of the middle class in Nepal. One of the ways in which academics all over the country have tried to mark their difference from literary writers and journalists is by publishing academic articles in journals with citations, footnotes and lists of references.Given this huge growth, it is very difficult to get hold of all the physical copies of the journals for keeping in institutional libraries. Subscription systems are mostly non-existent. Hence, it is a great service to researchers to be able to read full texts of new journal issues in NepJOL. In making such reading possible, NepJOL has definitely provided better visibility to the journals it hosts and better access to their contents. ContentsNepJOL states that journals are selected for inclusion in its portal if they meet the following first criterion: “They are scholarly in content, and contain original research.” When one goes through some issues of some of the social science and humanities journals now available in NepJOL, one would have to conclude that this criterion is also being applied rather liberally by the portal’s hosts and the editors of the participating journals. Without getting into the discussion about what might count as “scholarly” in content or “original” in research, it seems that as long as the journal contents are provided in the format of an academic output—articles with citations, footnotes and reference lists—they seem to qualify for uploading in NepJOL. Even more basically, once the journal passes the initial screening, anything that the journal editors provide will be uploaded. A good number of very readable research articles (and some great interviews) are found in the journals uploaded to NepJOL, and I recommend that you look them up and read the ones that interest you. However, in some issues of some journals, we find articles that might be best suited for publication in guidebooks (for example, pieces that discuss “how to do literature review” or “the APA style in research articles”). Quality controlled?Regarding the second criterion that journal contents should be “peer reviewed and quality controlled,” one would have to conclude that this criterion is also being applied rather liberally. Here too, it seems that anything supplied by the editors, once the journal has passed initial screening, will be uploaded. While I have not done the research to form a fully informed opinion on just what kinds of peer reviews are being done by participating journals in NepJOL, there is enough evidence in the uploaded contents to suggest that the quality of peer reviews being implemented varies a lot.For instance, I came across an article in the June 2023 issue of Baneshwor Campus Journal of Academia, where although two persons are named as authors, its text contains several sentences of the kind, “In this paper, I am going to portray the factors…” and “I am trying to introduce…” No explanation is provided in the text regarding this discrepancy. It should have been caught in the initial screening of the article by the journal’s editors and peer reviewers. Similarly, in the inaugural issue of Bagiswori Journal published in 2019, an article on think tanks in Nepal makes no reference to many relevant writings on the subject penned by other Nepali colleagues and myself. This lacuna, too, should have been caught in the peer review process.Let me be very clear. I am not saying that I hold the hosts of NepJOL responsible for these lapses in both the kinds of content being published and the poor peer screening that some of the published contents seem to have undergone during the pre-publication process. NepJOL is a database platform that hosts Nepali journals, and it cannot be faulted for the kind and quality of the contents being supplied under various journal titles. If I can use an analogy from the non-digital world, blaming NepJOL for the noted lapses would be the equivalent of blaming a physical bulletin board for the poor quality of notices put up on it!So, what is the point of this write-up, then? The first is that NepJOL has greatly increased access to Nepali journals and made their contents digitally available to readers for free. We (both Nepali and non-Nepali researchers of Nepali society) should read relevant content diligently to understand the complexities of Nepali history and society. We should also engage with such content in our own research by searching for it in the NepJOL portal. The second point to note is that the mere presence of a Nepali journal in NepJOL does not guarantee its quality and the quality of the peer review process that went into its making. Hence, universities should not treat journals in NepJOL as the platforms in which their students need to publish before or after entering MPhil or PhD programmes. Instead, they should encourage their students to publish in journals that execute a robust peer review process even if they are not hosted in NepJOL. Robust scholarship had a way of flourishing long before the internet was invented.

The elections took place in seven phases, across 44 days, to elect 543 Members of Parliament from 28 states and eight union territories. There were approximately 968 million eligible voters, out of whom 642 million people cast their ballots, making it one of the largest democratic exercises in the world. The ruling coalition garnered 293 seats, down from the 360 seats it had won back in 2019.The opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) managed 232 seats, while 16 seats went to candidates and parties contesting independently from either alliance. People of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Odisha simultaneously voted for their respective state assemblies, while the by-elections for 25 vacant constituencies were also held.Unpacking the mandateAfter a decade in power, the anti-incumbency factor is creeping in, as the BJP’s electoral appeal is diminishing among the voters. The party garnered only 240 seats, a significant down-turn from the 303 seats it had won in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. It won the majority of seats in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and New Delhi, but also severely suffered in many of its previous strongholds, including in the highly contested Uttar Pradesh. The results will especially reflect poorly on Narendra Modi, who had given lofty assurances of securing over 400 seats during his election campaigns. Nonetheless, he will lead the government for the third time, a record to be shared with India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.Despite losing the elections, the opposition alliance managed to gauze the national pulse. Besides questioning the BJP’s Hindutva ideology, which has polarised Indian society and polity, the alliance’s strategy to localise its campaigns and electoral agendas has strongly resonated among voters across different states. Three major issues merit special mention: First, the opposition strongly raised the issue of high unemployment rates during its election campaigns. India’s unemployment rate hovered between 6.5 to 8 percent in the last three years, a significant increase from 5.4 percent in 2014 when the NDA came to power. The other prominent issue raised by the opposition during the election campaigns was the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for the farmers. This issue has been a bone of contention between the government and the farmers, who constitute roughly 55 percent of the country’s 1.4 billion population. Last year’s farmer’s protest across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh would have significantly impacted the election results in these states, where NDA suffered heavy losses. The third issue the opposition raised, which could have turned the BJP’s electoral prospects, is that of the Agniveer scheme the NDA government launched in 2022. The opposition accused the ruling party of designing the short-term recruitment scheme to deny pensions to the Indian Army soldiers. Because the scheme targeted the younger recruits of the lower ranks, it can be assessed that it would have antagonised India’s large sections of the young population aspiring to join the forces. What comes next? Both the ruling and opposition alliances celebrated the results, interpreting it as their “electoral victory”. While returning to power for the third time is no small achievement in the world’s largest democracy, BJP top-brass will be seriously worried about the erosion of their vote base in what it considers to be a “Hindu heartland” state. The regression in Uttar Pradesh, which has the highest number of Lok Sabha seats, proved particularly damaging for the BJP-led alliance. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the coalition won 64 out of 80 seats in the State. It has now been reduced to a mere 36 seats. The poor results in UP surely bring the leadership of powerful BJP politician Yogi Adityanath under the scanner, especially when the current chief minister is also being seen as one of Modi’s potential successors. Although Modi himself has managed to secure a comfortable victory from his Varanasi constituency, he could also come under pressure from party dissidents and aspiring successors who have so far been silent due to the prime minister’s national and international appeal. On the other hand, the INDIA alliance has managed to secure respectable numbers, but will still face an uphill task at their opposition desk. The largest party in the alliance, the Indian National Congress, has managed 99 seats and will struggle to mount pressure on the opposition without strong support from its coalition partners. However, its fiery leader, Rahul Gandhi, a scion of the powerful Gandhi family, has been vocal in his criticism of the prime minister and his government. It can be expected that Gandhi will continue his “Bharat Jodo Yatra”, a nationwide campaign to reconnect with the electorate while keeping the Modi government on its toes inside Parliament. This is healthy for the Indian democracy, which lacked a strong voice of opposition in the past 10 years. Even the fact that the regional parties like Samajwadi Party of UP, Janata Dal-United of Bihar, All India Trinamool Congress of West Bengal, Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam of Tamil Nadu performed strongly for their respective alliances, is encouraging, and points towards increasing regional influence in Indian politics.Externally, the Modi government will continue to face a tough international climate it had been dealing with before the elections. India’s diplomatic relationship with the West, which had strengthened through strong economic, cultural and security partnerships, has been strained over the past year in the wake of the Ukraine war and India’s alleged covert operation against the Sikh separatists living in the United States and Canada. Modi will also face the challenge of restoring normalcy to his country’s relationship with strategic allies, which is key to New Delhi’s efforts to contain China’s increased ambitions in South Asia.Regionally, the BJP’s return to power will relieve Bangladesh’s Shiekh Hasina government, which has faced its share of international condemnation for its poor human rights record and a crack-down against its political opposition. On the other hand, the relationship with the Maldives is far from normal under the new Mohamed Muizzu government in Male, which will test Modi’s foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific region. The relationship with Sri Lanka and Nepal has improved but will require close engagement and incentives that reflect Colombo and Kathmandu’s developmental ambitions. Summing up, the Indian election results have ensured Modi’s third tenure in office will not be smooth sailing. Besides managing dissent within his party, he will have to gain the confidence of regional coalition partners and even reach out to the opposition camp where necessary to push through major policy agendas. It is unlikely the regional and global climate will be favourable to him either.  ","summary":"India’s 18th Lok Sabha election results have brought the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) back to power for the third time in a decade. The elections took place in seven phases, across 44 days, to elect 543 Members of Parliament from 28 states and eight union territories. There were approximately 968 million eligible voters, out of whom 642 million people cast their ballots, making it one of the largest democratic exercises in the world. The ruling coalition garnered 293 seats, down from the 360 seats it had won back in 2019.The opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) managed 232 seats, while 16 seats went to candidates and parties contesting independently from either alliance. People of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Odisha simultaneously voted for their respective state assemblies, while the by-elections for 25 vacant constituencies were also held.Unpacking the mandateAfter a decade in power, the anti-incumbency factor is creeping in, as the BJP’s electoral appeal is diminishing among the voters. The party garnered only 240 seats, a significant down-turn from the 303 seats it had won in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. It won the majority of seats in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and New Delhi, but also severely suffered in many of its previous strongholds, including in the highly contested Uttar Pradesh. The results will especially reflect poorly on Narendra Modi, who had given lofty assurances of securing over 400 seats during his election campaigns. Nonetheless, he will lead the government for the third time, a record to be shared with India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.Despite losing the elections, the opposition alliance managed to gauze the national pulse. Besides questioning the BJP’s Hindutva ideology, which has polarised Indian society and polity, the alliance’s strategy to localise its campaigns and electoral agendas has strongly resonated among voters across different states. Three major issues merit special mention: First, the opposition strongly raised the issue of high unemployment rates during its election campaigns. India’s unemployment rate hovered between 6.5 to 8 percent in the last three years, a significant increase from 5.4 percent in 2014 when the NDA came to power. The other prominent issue raised by the opposition during the election campaigns was the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for the farmers. This issue has been a bone of contention between the government and the farmers, who constitute roughly 55 percent of the country’s 1.4 billion population. Last year’s farmer’s protest across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh would have significantly impacted the election results in these states, where NDA suffered heavy losses. The third issue the opposition raised, which could have turned the BJP’s electoral prospects, is that of the Agniveer scheme the NDA government launched in 2022. The opposition accused the ruling party of designing the short-term recruitment scheme to deny pensions to the Indian Army soldiers. Because the scheme targeted the younger recruits of the lower ranks, it can be assessed that it would have antagonised India’s large sections of the young population aspiring to join the forces. What comes next? Both the ruling and opposition alliances celebrated the results, interpreting it as their “electoral victory”. While returning to power for the third time is no small achievement in the world’s largest democracy, BJP top-brass will be seriously worried about the erosion of their vote base in what it considers to be a “Hindu heartland” state. The regression in Uttar Pradesh, which has the highest number of Lok Sabha seats, proved particularly damaging for the BJP-led alliance. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the coalition won 64 out of 80 seats in the State. It has now been reduced to a mere 36 seats. The poor results in UP surely bring the leadership of powerful BJP politician Yogi Adityanath under the scanner, especially when the current chief minister is also being seen as one of Modi’s potential successors. Although Modi himself has managed to secure a comfortable victory from his Varanasi constituency, he could also come under pressure from party dissidents and aspiring successors who have so far been silent due to the prime minister’s national and international appeal. On the other hand, the INDIA alliance has managed to secure respectable numbers, but will still face an uphill task at their opposition desk. The largest party in the alliance, the Indian National Congress, has managed 99 seats and will struggle to mount pressure on the opposition without strong support from its coalition partners. However, its fiery leader, Rahul Gandhi, a scion of the powerful Gandhi family, has been vocal in his criticism of the prime minister and his government. It can be expected that Gandhi will continue his “Bharat Jodo Yatra”, a nationwide campaign to reconnect with the electorate while keeping the Modi government on its toes inside Parliament. This is healthy for the Indian democracy, which lacked a strong voice of opposition in the past 10 years. Even the fact that the regional parties like Samajwadi Party of UP, Janata Dal-United of Bihar, All India Trinamool Congress of West Bengal, Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam of Tamil Nadu performed strongly for their respective alliances, is encouraging, and points towards increasing regional influence in Indian politics.Externally, the Modi government will continue to face a tough international climate it had been dealing with before the elections.

As the results poured in, Modi addressed the public in a televised speech in which he termed the NDA’s victory a “historic feat”. Modi also used the opportunity to list out what he called achievements of his 10-year stint as the prime minister—poverty alleviation, employment generation, economic growth, and so on. But his gait during the speech, and the spirit of the BJP leaders appearing on talk shows on television channels close to the BJP, suggested something was amiss. After months of pompously claiming that the NDA would cross the 400-seat mark in the 543-strong parliament, Modi was finally coming back to reality with a humble 293 seats, while the BJP’s own tally was 240, well below the 272 mark for a majority. Even more distressing for Modi was that the opposition alliance, INDIA, secured 230 seats, a feat even the opposition parties themselves had not expected considering the BJP’s hubris in the run-up to the elections. This was certainly a humbling moment for Modi. An important message the Indian electorate has given Modi, the BJP and the NDA is that there is only so much you can gain from the politics of religion. Coming on the heels of a massive campaign to “reinstate” Lord Ram in Ayodhya, the election was seen as a referendum on Modi’s Hindutva politics. The results have shown that the Indian citizens are not as excited as Modi and his partyfolk about the idea of establishing a “Ram Rajya”. Anti-incumbency aside, the falling numbers—the BJP got 303 seats, and the NDA 353 seats in the 2019 parliamentary elections—are a tell-tale sign of the voters’ dissatisfaction with where India is headed as the living conditions of most people remained largely unchanged amid growing economic disparities. Another humbling prospect for Modi is having to share the stage with N Chandrababu Naidu of Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar of Bihar. The fact that the opposition alliance is now strong enough to lure Naidu and Nitish into their camp—especially with Nitish earning the nickname “Paltu Babu” owing to his history of changing alliances—must have come as a hard truth for Modi, who has wielded a strong hand over governance during his two terms. This could mean that India is headed back to the days of coalition raj, much like in the nineties when small political parties that had emerged from the fringes came to the mainstream and played kingmakers, thus destabilising governments much like in present-day Nepal. How a humbled Modi will negotiate the terms of coalition politics will be for us to see in the coming days. But what the Indian electorate has proven, through the world’s largest electoral machinery, is that democracy is a daily plebiscite. No matter how fool-proof an image you build of yourself as an invincible leader on the back of a subservient media, there is a community of silent voters waiting for the right moment to make a course correction. That the Indian electorate has shattered the prospect of establishing a ‘one party state’ in the globe’s largest democracy will also give heart to those fighting for democratic rights everywhere in the world.  ","summary":"The National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, has clinched a victory for the third consecutive term in the Indian parliamentary elections, paving the way for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to continue his hold on power.

In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  ","summary":"The collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress.

After the general elections in November 2022, Saroj Kumar Yadav of the same party has been leading the Madhesh government. Though the Madhesh administration introduced a few good programmes, experts say, it failed to lead the government on many fronts. “As leaders and people from Madhesh were at the forefront of advocating for the federal system, they should have done more to strengthen the system,” Sohan Shah, a Madhesh expert, told the Post. “The party not only failed to strengthen federalism but also in good governance and other parameters.”He accused the Madheshi leaders of wasting more time bargaining with the centre instead of working to strengthen the federal system.Shah adds a fresh anecdote to explain why the JSP-Nepal-led government can be termed a failure in Madhesh.The federal government allocates the budget for provinces and the local level every year under the equalisation and special grants headers. As per the rule, the provincial Cabinet, in the case of the province, and local units, submit proposals to the National Planning Commission (NPC) with a demand for grants for projects. While all local units of Madhesh submitted their proposals, the provincial government failed to do so, Shah claimed.Except for the Madhesh Province, the NPC received over 3,600 proposals from across the country for fiscal equalisation and special grants for the upcoming fiscal year, to be incorporated in the national budget.“That was sheer negligence on the part of the Madhesh government,” an NPC official told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “We did not have such an experience where a provincial government did not apply for a significant amount of the national budget.”After leading Madhesh politics for more than a decade and a half, Upendra Yadav lost the 2022 general election to CK Raut in Saptari-2. It was a severe blow to the veteran leader to lose the race to a newbie. With the slogan of good and efficient governance and an anti-corruption campaign, Raut’s party won popular support in Madhesh. The new party secured 13 seats in the provincial assembly, becoming the fourth-largest party in Madhesh. Despite this the province's government was again led by JSP-Nepal, the third-largest party with 19 seats in the assembly. However, the JSP-Nepal’s strength further diminished after the Ashok Rai faction split the party on May 5 and launched the Janata Samata Party. Upendra Yadav has challenged the split, and the case is sub judice.Of the party’s total 12 members in the federal parliament, seven have joined the Rai-led party. The assembly members in Madhesh, however, didn’t join the new party as the party formation process was immediately challenged in the court.A newcomer in provincial and national politics, Janamat has been joining and quitting governments.“Janamat Party was prepared to remain in the opposition because the party wanted nothing less than government leadership. While the UML and the Maoist Centre have decided to form a new government in Madhesh, they cannot do it without Janamat’s support, and are left with no option but to accept Janamat's candidate for new chief minister,” said Shah.The CPN-UML is the largest party in the provincial assembly, with 25 seats, and the Congress, with 22 seats, is the second-largest. However, Upendra Yadav’s party has always led the provincial government.Experts say that major issues of Madhesh cannot be addressed in a true sense until the big political parties ignore them.Chandra Kishore, a Madhesh expert, also claims that the province got nothing substantive in the seven years of federal exercise. If the political parties other than JSP-Nepal lead the province, it could be in favour of the Madheshi people in many ways, Kishor said. “Madhesh does not belong to just one Madheshi party; it belongs to the other parties as well,” Chandra Kishore told the Post. “Parties other than JSP-Nepal vying to lead the Madhesh government means they also should own the agenda of Madhesh, which is a good thing.” Chandra Kishore added that if the new political parties lead the Madhesh Province, it could bring plurality in governance. As per the agreement reached between the three parties–CPN-UML, CPN (Maoist Centre), and Janamat Party—Raut’s Janamat is most likely to lead the next government in the province. “Raut’s party could challenge Yadav’s dominance in the province with an effective governance to establish him as a key political figure of Madhesh,” said Chandra Kishore. Incumbent chief minister, Saroj Kumar Yadav, lost the majority in the assembly after the UML and the Maoist Centre withdrew their support for the government. This has set the stage for a floor test on Wednesday.To claim the position in the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister needs the support of 54 members. Though the ruling partners claim that the Unified Socialist and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), in addition to Nagarik Unmukti and Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party, will also support the government, the Unified Socialist and the LSP remain non-committal so far.On May 30, the UML, the Maoist Centre, and the Janamat Party agreed to support Mahesh Prasad Yadav, the Janamat parliamentary party leader, as the chief minister of the Province in a meeting held in Janakpur. On May 29, Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba invited Upendra Yadav, chair of Janata Samajbadi Nepal, Mahantha Thakur, chair of LSP, and Madhav Nepal, chair of the CPN (Unified Socialist), to his residence to discuss the political equation in Madhesh. During the meeting, three opposition parties including the Unified Socialist, a federal ruling partner, had agreed to uphold the JSP-Nepal’s leadership in Madhesh Province. However, Ratneshwar Goit of the Unified Socialist talking to the Post said, “Our party is discussing whom we should support to form the provincial government.”  ","summary":"The Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal has continuously led the Madhesh government since the provincial governments were first set up following the 2017 elections.Over the past seven years, Yadav has always been on the governing side despite the many mergers and splits among Madhesh-based parties.The party’s Lalbabu Raut is the only chief minister (among the seven) who completed a full five-year term after 2017. After the general elections in November 2022, Saroj Kumar Yadav of the same party has been leading the Madhesh government. Though the Madhesh administration introduced a few good programmes, experts say, it failed to lead the government on many fronts. “As leaders and people from Madhesh were at the forefront of advocating for the federal system, they should have done more to strengthen the system,” Sohan Shah, a Madhesh expert, told the Post. “The party not only failed to strengthen federalism but also in good governance and other parameters.”He accused the Madheshi leaders of wasting more time bargaining with the centre instead of working to strengthen the federal system.Shah adds a fresh anecdote to explain why the JSP-Nepal-led government can be termed a failure in Madhesh.The federal government allocates the budget for provinces and the local level every year under the equalisation and special grants headers. As per the rule, the provincial Cabinet, in the case of the province, and local units, submit proposals to the National Planning Commission (NPC) with a demand for grants for projects. While all local units of Madhesh submitted their proposals, the provincial government failed to do so, Shah claimed.Except for the Madhesh Province, the NPC received over 3,600 proposals from across the country for fiscal equalisation and special grants for the upcoming fiscal year, to be incorporated in the national budget.“That was sheer negligence on the part of the Madhesh government,” an NPC official told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “We did not have such an experience where a provincial government did not apply for a significant amount of the national budget.”After leading Madhesh politics for more than a decade and a half, Upendra Yadav lost the 2022 general election to CK Raut in Saptari-2. It was a severe blow to the veteran leader to lose the race to a newbie. With the slogan of good and efficient governance and an anti-corruption campaign, Raut’s party won popular support in Madhesh. The new party secured 13 seats in the provincial assembly, becoming the fourth-largest party in Madhesh. Despite this the province's government was again led by JSP-Nepal, the third-largest party with 19 seats in the assembly. However, the JSP-Nepal’s strength further diminished after the Ashok Rai faction split the party on May 5 and launched the Janata Samata Party. Upendra Yadav has challenged the split, and the case is sub judice.Of the party’s total 12 members in the federal parliament, seven have joined the Rai-led party. The assembly members in Madhesh, however, didn’t join the new party as the party formation process was immediately challenged in the court.A newcomer in provincial and national politics, Janamat has been joining and quitting governments.“Janamat Party was prepared to remain in the opposition because the party wanted nothing less than government leadership. While the UML and the Maoist Centre have decided to form a new government in Madhesh, they cannot do it without Janamat’s support, and are left with no option but to accept Janamat's candidate for new chief minister,” said Shah.The CPN-UML is the largest party in the provincial assembly, with 25 seats, and the Congress, with 22 seats, is the second-largest. However, Upendra Yadav’s party has always led the provincial government.Experts say that major issues of Madhesh cannot be addressed in a true sense until the big political parties ignore them.Chandra Kishore, a Madhesh expert, also claims that the province got nothing substantive in the seven years of federal exercise. If the political parties other than JSP-Nepal lead the province, it could be in favour of the Madheshi people in many ways, Kishor said. “Madhesh does not belong to just one Madheshi party; it belongs to the other parties as well,” Chandra Kishore told the Post. “Parties other than JSP-Nepal vying to lead the Madhesh government means they also should own the agenda of Madhesh, which is a good thing.” Chandra Kishore added that if the new political parties lead the Madhesh Province, it could bring plurality in governance.

The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  ","summary":"These days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events.

Identifying herself as a feminist, she is committed to fostering an inclusive society. Bista has also run projects such as ‘Rage Against Rape’ and ‘Dignified Menstruation’.In conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Bista discusses how her reading choices influence the leadership sessions she conducts at her organisation.How did you develop your love for reading?My love for reading began in my childhood. My mother often took me to libraries in Kathmandu, including a particular favourite, A-Won Library. She also secured a guest membership for me at the Lincoln School library, further nurturing my passion for books.From a young age, I had access to various books. My cousins and aunts owned collections that were hard to find in Nepal. Instead of playing outside, I often chose to spend my time reading. I still cherish some of the books from my childhood collection, including Charles Dickens ‘David Copperfield’ and several Ladybird books.I loved storytelling at my school. I would raise my hand whenever the students were asked to share a story in class. The daughter of my father’s colleague studied in Darjeeling, and we became friends through our shared love of books. During her holidays, we exchanged books and discussed them, making our conversations book-centred. This flexible and encouraging environment for sharing and exchanging books nurtured and deepened my love for reading.How has reading helped you conduct sessions at Women LEAD?I love conducting leadership sessions at my organisation. I primarily cover topics like advocacy and feminism, among others. My passion for reading has been incredibly beneficial in these sessions, as I frequently cite books as references. This approach shows that my discussions are based on credible sources rather than personal opinions. Using book references makes the sessions more engaging and helps promote a reading culture among young leaders.Can you share a recent book or author you’ve read that has impacted the way you approach your work?Every book I read inspires and leaves me in awe. However, I have found Cal Newport’s ‘Deep Work’ particularly essential. Although I usually avoid self-help books, this one has been a lifeline, especially when dealing with social media trolls. It has greatly helped me manage negative comments and maintain my mental well-being.Gloria Steinem’s ‘My Life on the Road’ has also deeply influenced me. A renowned feminist, Steinem offers insights that I frequently revisit. Recently, I read ‘Cut from the Same Cloth’ by Sabeena Akhtar, an intriguing exploration of the hijab and how different backgrounds shape our practices.Maya Angelou, Bell Hooks, and Audre Lorde’s books have significantly shaped my leadership, and I often refer to them during sessions at Women LEAD.How do you think reading contributes to personal and professional development, especially for young women?Reading undeniably contributes to the personal and professional development of both women and men. For one, it broadens an individual's worldview and thought process. We all have limitations, particularly in Nepal, where access to resources is often restricted. Social media can partially bridge this gap, but it also has its limitations and pitfalls. Reading, especially literature, profoundly influences our perceptions, providing us with diverse perspectives to consider.For young girls, reading reveals that age is not a barrier to starting new ventures. Everyone reaches a point in life where they must press forward with focused determination. However, this forward momentum can sometimes be interrupted by patriarchal norms or family constraints, which can restrict our growth.Reading helps us challenge and change these perceptions, aiding our personal and professional development. Additionally, young individuals might struggle to express themselves within their families. Reading provides them with examples and arguments they can use to explain their aspirations to their families.Books like ‘Educated’ by Tara Westover and ‘The Glass Castle’ by Jeannette Walls offer valuable lessons. The female characters in these books emerge as survivors, making the stories eye-opening and inspiring.In Nepal, we have powerful stories of figures like Yogmaya and Parijat. Their experiences offer abundant lessons and relatable inspiration.How do you manage time for reading? Similar to how I need coffee in the morning, books are an absolute necessity for me.Even if I have just a few moments, I take the opportunity to read. Whenever I find a spare moment, I feel compelled to read at least a page of whatever book I'm currently engrossed in.How do you discover new books to read? Do you rely on recommendations or something else?I regularly review the shortlists for the Booker Prize and Penguin, with a strong focus on works by women writers. This helps me compile a list of books shortlisted for the Booker Prize.As someone who likes to stay informed about the books young people are reading, I frequently visit Goodreads. Keeping up to date with the reading preferences of young people helps me conduct effective discussions during sessions at Women LEAD.Hima Bista’s book recommendations: The Museum of InnocenceAuthor: Orhan PamukPublisher: İletişimYear: 2008 Orhan Pamuk is one of my favourite writers. I am fascinated by the Turkish setup and of course, the Ottoman Empire’s history, and I love how he weaves these elements in his novels. My Life on the RoadAuthor: Gloria SteinemPublisher: Random HouseYear: 2015This book traces the journey of Gloria Steinem as she embarks on the development and expansion of an equality revolution. As a feminist leader, this book speaks volumes to me. The Difficulty of Being Good Author: Gurcharan DasPublisher: Penguin Random HouseYear: 2009Das's book focuses on the essence of Dharma and righteousness, a key concept in Indian Philosophy. It is a reality that we all need to read, see, and come to terms with.Deep WorkAuthor: Cal NewportPublisher: Grand Central PublishingYear: 2016I have found Cal Newport’s ‘Deep Work’ particularly insightful. This book has greatly helped me manage negative comments and maintain my mental well-being.The Lord of the RingsAuthor: JRR TolkienPublisher: Allen and UnwinYear: 1954Set in middle-earth, this book is an epic high fantasy novel by Tolkien. Sometimes it is essential to immerse ourselves in a mythical world. The Hobbit is part of it, and I love it.  ","summary":"Hima Bista serves as the executive director of Women LEAD Nepal, an organisation dedicated to empowering young women in Nepal to become leaders and change-makers.

I would raise my hand whenever the students were asked to share a story in class. The daughter of my father’s colleague studied in Darjeeling, and we became friends through our shared love of books. During her holidays, we exchanged books and discussed them, making our conversations book-centred. This flexible and encouraging environment for sharing and exchanging books nurtured and deepened my love for reading.How has reading helped you conduct sessions at Women LEAD?I love conducting leadership sessions at my organisation. I primarily cover topics like advocacy and feminism, among others. My passion for reading has been incredibly beneficial in these sessions, as I frequently cite books as references. This approach shows that my discussions are based on credible sources rather than personal opinions. Using book references makes the sessions more engaging and helps promote a reading culture among young leaders.Can you share a recent book or author you’ve read that has impacted the way you approach your work?Every book I read inspires and leaves me in awe. However, I have found Cal Newport’s ‘Deep Work’ particularly essential. Although I usually avoid self-help books, this one has been a lifeline, especially when dealing with social media trolls. It has greatly helped me manage negative comments and maintain my mental well-being.Gloria Steinem’s ‘My Life on the Road’ has also deeply influenced me. A renowned feminist, Steinem offers insights that I frequently revisit. Recently, I read ‘Cut from the Same Cloth’ by Sabeena Akhtar, an intriguing exploration of the hijab and how different backgrounds shape our practices.Maya Angelou, Bell Hooks, and Audre Lorde’s books have significantly shaped my leadership, and I often refer to them during sessions at Women LEAD.How do you think reading contributes to personal and professional development, especially for young women?Reading undeniably contributes to the personal and professional development of both women and men. For one, it broadens an individual's worldview and thought process. We all have limitations, particularly in Nepal, where access to resources is often restricted. Social media can partially bridge this gap, but it also has its limitations and pitfalls. Reading, especially literature, profoundly influences our perceptions, providing us with diverse perspectives to consider.For young girls, reading reveals that age is not a barrier to starting new ventures. Everyone reaches a point in life where they must press forward with focused determination. However, this forward momentum can sometimes be interrupted by patriarchal norms or family constraints, which can restrict our growth.Reading helps us challenge and change these perceptions, aiding our personal and professional development. Additionally, young individuals might struggle to express themselves within their families. Reading provides them with examples and arguments they can use to explain their aspirations to their families.Books like ‘Educated’ by Tara Westover and ‘The Glass Castle’ by Jeannette Walls offer valuable lessons. The female characters in these books emerge as survivors, making the stories eye-opening and inspiring.In Nepal, we have powerful stories of figures like Yogmaya and Parijat. Their experiences offer abundant lessons and relatable inspiration.How do you manage time for reading? Similar to how I need coffee in the morning, books are an absolute necessity for me.Even if I have just a few moments, I take the opportunity to read. Whenever I find a spare moment, I feel compelled to read at least a page of whatever book I'm currently engrossed in.How do you discover new books to read? Do you rely on recommendations or something else?I regularly review the shortlists for the Booker Prize and Penguin, with a strong focus on works by women writers. This helps me compile a list of books shortlisted for the Booker Prize.As someone who likes to stay informed about the books young people are reading, I frequently visit Goodreads. Keeping up to date with the reading preferences of young people helps me conduct effective discussions during sessions at Women LEAD.Hima Bista’s book recommendations: The Museum of InnocenceAuthor: Orhan PamukPublisher: İletişimYear: 2008 Orhan Pamuk is one of my favourite writers. I am fascinated by the Turkish setup and of course, the Ottoman Empire’s history, and I love how he weaves these elements in his novels. My Life on the RoadAuthor: Gloria SteinemPublisher: Random HouseYear: 2015This book traces the journey of Gloria Steinem as she embarks on the development and expansion of an equality revolution. As a feminist leader, this book speaks volumes to me. The Difficulty of Being Good Author: Gurcharan DasPublisher: Penguin Random HouseYear: 2009Das's book focuses on the essence of Dharma and righteousness, a key concept in Indian Philosophy. It is a reality that we all need to read, see, and come to terms with.Deep WorkAuthor: Cal NewportPublisher: Grand Central PublishingYear: 2016I have found Cal Newport’s ‘Deep Work’ particularly insightful. This book has greatly helped me manage negative comments and maintain my mental well-being.The Lord of the RingsAuthor: JRR TolkienPublisher: Allen and UnwinYear: 1954Set in middle-earth, this book is an epic high fantasy novel by Tolkien. Sometimes it is essential to immerse ourselves in a mythical world. The Hobbit is part of it, and I love it.  "},{"hash":"7f662e996903eb14eb67233a02e23ed8dfbfce6a95efa09b1d46518a920b5c16","title":"madhesh-chief-minister-yadav-fails-floor-test","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/05/madhesh-chief-minister-yadav-fails-floor-test","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb1-1717600887.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717545600000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"Madhesh Chief Minister Saroj Kumar Yadav lost his position on Wednesday, 17 months into his appointment, after failing to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the provincial assembly.A meeting of the provincial assembly rejected the motion tabled by the chief minister seeking the assembly’s trust.Assembly Speaker Ramchandra Mandal announced that of the 103 members present, 50 members of the assembly voted in favour of his motion while 53 voted against. In the 107-strong Madhesh assembly, the support of 54 assembly members is required for a simple majority.The federal coalition of the Maoist Centre, the CPN-UML and the Janamat Party, among others, is set to stake claim to a new government in the province. CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Yuvaraj Bhattarai claimed that although 53 assembly members voted against Yadav on Wednesday, the new coalition has 55 votes in the assembly and its candidate will swiftly win the chief ministership.“Assembly members representing the Nagarik Unmukti Party and Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party were absent during the trust vote, but they are with us,” Bhattarai told the Post. The two parties each have an assembly member. With 25 members, the CPN-UML is the largest party in Madhesh provincial assembly, while the Congress is second-largest with 22 members. Likewise, the JSP-Nepal has 19, the Janamat Party 13, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal 9, the CPN (Maoist Centre) 9, the CPN (Unified Socialist) 7 and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party, the Nagarik Unmukti Party and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party one each.Earlier, leaders from the CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre), and the CPN (Unified Socialist) had reportedly agreed to form the provincial government in Madhesh under the leadership of CK Raut-led Janamat party’s provincial assembly leader. On May 30, Janamat Party chair Raut had announced that the federal coalition members including Mahantha Thakur-led Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal would support his party to form the government in Madhesh. However, leaders from Thakur’s party and the Unified Socialist had said they have yet to make an official decision.Yadav, provincial assembly leader of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, was appointed the chief minister on January 11, 2023.The Yadav-led provincial government lost the majority after the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support on May 12.The chief minister went for the floor test as per the mandatory provision of the constitution. This provision requires a chief minister to undergo a floor test within 30 days if the party the chief minister represents splits or a coalition partner withdraws its support.Upendra Yadav’s parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, had been in power in Madhesh Province for nearly seven consecutive years. Yadav formed several parties over the past seven years through splits or mergers. The latest split of Yadav’s JSP-Nepal happened on May 5, when its federal chair Ashok Rai, backed by several senior leaders, launched a new Janata Samajbadi Party. The Election Commission recognised the new party on May 6, compelling Chief Minister Yadav to undergo a floor test as per Article 188 (2) of the Constitution. “If the political party which the Chief Minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition Government withdraws its support, the Chief Minister shall table a resolution in the State Assembly for a vote of confidence within thirty days,” reads the Article of the Constitution. Earlier, Chief Minister Yadav had planned to defer the trust vote. He had requested the assembly to reschedule the vote for Monday next week, citing his poor health. However, he later agreed to face the assembly due to fear of ‘automatically’ losing the position. Leaders from rival parties had claimed that Yadav would lose the position based on the date of the split of the JSP-Nepal if he refused to undergo a floor test. There were also legal questions over the requirement for floor test as the Supreme Court, acting on a petition by Upendra Yadav, has ordered the election body to freeze the registration of the Ashok Rai-led party, until a final verdict.On Wednesday evening, Province Head Sumitra Bhandari invited parties for government formation in accordance with Article 168(2) of the Constitution. The parties have until 10 am Friday to submit their claims. The provision states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the assembly under clause(1), the Province Head shall appoint as the chief minister a member of the assembly who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties representing the provincial assembly.The new chief minister will be required to secure the confidence of the provincial assembly within 30 days of appointment. With Wednesday’s trust vote, Upendra Yadav’s party has been ousted from power six and a half years after the first provincial assembly elections. Previously, Yadav’s aide Lal Babu Raut served a full five-year term as chief minister of the province.

Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.“No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,” said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill. Some of its lawmakers like Radheshyam Adhikari had criticised it strongly in the Upper House. However, it wasn't objected to by the Congress while endorsing it.Experts say this is an example of how laws are passed in Nepal. The executive includes provisions that allow for policy corruption, and these are endorsed as lawmakers do not care to engage in a thorough study and deliberations over the bill.“Policy corruption at the executive level can be checked if the lawmakers are vigilant and lawmaking is transparent,” Khimlal Devkota, a former National Assembly member who has closely studied Nepal’s law-making process, told the Post.Policy decisions in Nepal have become rather controversial. Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House.Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. “The lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.“The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.”Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process.

Over the last couple of days, Dahal, Oli and Nepal have held several rounds of talks in order to give full shape to the provincial government in Sudurpaschim, to form a new government in Madhesh, and bring new parties like the Nagarik Unmukti and Janamat Party into the federal government.Once a new government is formed in Madhesh, the prime minister is likely to add some ministers from the Nagarik Unmukti Party and Janamat Party, said Mahesh Bartaula, chief whip of the UML. This has been the topic of discussion among the top leaders in the past few days, he said. “I don’t think the entire Cabinet will change,” he said.However, according to one Maoist Centre leader, the prime minister is in a difficult situation after the chairman of the CPN (Unified Socialist) Nepal sought a package deal on power-sharing.Jagannath Khatiwada, spokesperson of the Unified Socialist said his party has communicated its demands clearly to both Dahal and Oli.“During recent meetings with the prime minister and the UML chief, our chairman made it clear that we need an additional minister in the federal government, a fair share in Koshi, Madhesh and Karnali governments, and participation of the UML and Maoist Centre in the Sudurpaschim government before the formation of the government in Koshi,” he said.Dirgha Bahadur Sodari of the Unified Socialist is the chief minister in Sudurpaschim, but the delay by the UML and Maoist Centre in joining the government has caused frustration within the Unified Socialist.In order to extend support for forming a new government in the Madhesh province, which will probably be led by the Janamat Party, the Unified Socialist party has withdrawn its two ministers from the current Saroj Kumar Yadav government. Yadav is the chief minister of the Madhesh province and represents the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal.A section of the Maoist Centre has been calling for the replacement of the entire set of ministers in the Dahal Cabinet. But the UML, the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Unified Socialist are against doing so. “Some of our ministers have been serving since December 2022, so some leaders in the party want to replace them with new faces,” a central committee member of the Maoist Centre said. With the exception of Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, there is a call within the party to replace all the ministers, the leader said, adding that “this agenda will likely be discussed during the upcoming meeting of the party.” Besides the prime minister, the CPN (Maoist Centre) has one deputy prime minister, and four ministers in the Cabinet.“There are several issues, but nothing has been discussed,” said Govinda Acharya, press adviser to the Prime Minister Dahal. “First, ministers from the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party are likely to join the Cabinet as per the understanding among party leaders.”“Our position is clear,” said Khatiwada, the Unified Socialist spokesperson. “We want a package deal, which we have clearly communicated both to prime minister Dahal and UML chair Oli.”“From the centre to the provincial level as well as in other major political appointments, we need a fair share,” said Khatiwada. He complained that the prime minister and the UML chief assured several times in the past to address the grievances of the Unified Socialist, but the promise has not been kept. To show his frustration, party chief Nepal participated in a meeting of the opposition parties a few days ago.“We have decided to help the federal coalition install a new government in the Madhesh province. So we need a fair share in provincial governments in Madhesh, Koshi, Karnali and Sudurpaschim.

With the exception of Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, there is a call within the party to replace all the ministers, the leader said, adding that “this agenda will likely be discussed during the upcoming meeting of the party.” Besides the prime minister, the CPN (Maoist Centre) has one deputy prime minister, and four ministers in the Cabinet.“There are several issues, but nothing has been discussed,” said Govinda Acharya, press adviser to the Prime Minister Dahal. “First, ministers from the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party are likely to join the Cabinet as per the understanding among party leaders.”“Our position is clear,” said Khatiwada, the Unified Socialist spokesperson. “We want a package deal, which we have clearly communicated both to prime minister Dahal and UML chair Oli.”“From the centre to the provincial level as well as in other major political appointments, we need a fair share,” said Khatiwada. He complained that the prime minister and the UML chief assured several times in the past to address the grievances of the Unified Socialist, but the promise has not been kept. To show his frustration, party chief Nepal participated in a meeting of the opposition parties a few days ago.“We have decided to help the federal coalition install a new government in the Madhesh province. So we need a fair share in provincial governments in Madhesh, Koshi, Karnali and Sudurpaschim. Cabinet reshuffle is solely the prime minister’s prerogative and he might be feeling pressure from within his own party. He may replace his party’s ministers, but this has not been discussed in the meetings of alliance members,” Khatiwada told the Post.

Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

Everybody knows who deployed the federal police and what their intention is. There are hundreds of places in Kathmandu where road conditions are not good, but the Road Division has hurried to fix the parts we cut for expansion of the sidewalks.”The dispute between the two agencies—Road Division and Kathmandu metropolis—over expanding pedestrian lanes and not letting cutting road sections spiraled into Monday’s standoff.Some ten days ago, the metropolis cut 1.5 metres on both sides of roads in New Road to expand footpaths.The division intervened and stopped the metropolis workers from cutting the roads, saying that the road section comes under its jurisdiction and that the city office has not taken approval for the footpath expansion.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed officials to dump truckloads of dirt and trash in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office, blaming the agencies for delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj which had caused problems for the public.Taking to social media, Kathmandu Mayor Shah blamed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth for not expediting the road expansion.“If your direct order can stop an ongoing project, it can also complete the work,” Shah said.“For the past 15 years, the citizens of Kathmandu have had to breathe in dusty air and face hardships in the name of Ring Road expansion,” reads Shah’s status posted on social media.Mayor Shah also sarcastically warned that the KMC would send a truckload of dust as a gift to Minister Mahaseth every day until the work along the Ring Road section is expedited.“It does not look good for only the public to suffer. I will continue to send a truckload of dust to you as a ‘gift’ every day until the work is resumed. Please accept it as love,” Shah wrote.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years.The Road Division, which picked up the dust and garbage dumped by the metropolis on its own, criticised the metropolis for its act.“The behaviour of the largest and responsible local government of the country mocks the rule of law, and this kind of behaviour in a violent and chaotic manner will never enhance the dignity of the metropolis,” reads the statement issued by the division.The division later issued an ultimatum to the KMC, asking it to fix the damaged parts of the roads within two days.When the metropolis ignored the ultimatum, the division itself repaired the damaged parts taking the help of federal police forces.“The metropolis dug up the roads without taking approval from our office. Instead of seeking approval, it gave us notice about its decision,” said Pramod Khatiwada, information officer at the division. “As the monsoon is about to start and the New Road area is one of the busiest road sections, it was our responsibility to repair it.”When asked if metropolis officials are committed to expanding the pavements, Khatiwada said that he hoped concerned officials would “come to their senses” and sort out the disputes, obtaining approval from concerned agencies.“They should first hold discussions with officials and higher agencies and convince them why they need to expand the footpath and take over the road section from us,” said Khatiwada. “We hope that the city office will not repeat the same mistake again and again.”Metropolis officials said that footpaths in new road areas, which always remain busy and packed, should be widened enough so that pedestrians can move freely. Officials claimed that locals from the New Road area have also requested the city office for the expansion.“Locals have also complained about insecurity and sexual harassment in walking on the footpath,” said Sunita Maharjan, elected ward member of Ward 24 of the metropolis. “Locals from our ward have no objection to the expansion of the footpath. The metropolis has started expansion works in demand of the public.”Sobha Malakar, a local from the Indrachowk area, said that it is very difficult to walk on the narrow pavement in the New Road area. Most of the locals of Ward 24 demanded the expansion of the footpaths with the city office. “It is very difficult to walk freely on the footpath in the New Road area,” said Malakar. “Walking on the footpath is very suffocating in the area. Women and girls walk on the road risking collision with vehicles.”Some people supported the Road Division's moves to prevent the city office from expanding the footpath on Monday. Locals of Ward 24 said that those not seeking pavement expansion are from other wards who fear that the already narrowed roads in their area would be further narrowed.“Those who had protested for parking in New Road have been protesting against the expansion of the footpath,” reads Mayor Shah’s status posted on social media.He asked the public to consider how the road will be narrowed for driving when a sidewalk is made only of parts that were used for parking in the past.

This shows that the government is not serious towards the consumers and sensitive industries like the food industry,” said Dugar. He questioned the rationale behind the advance tax imposed on food imports and the principle of taxation.He said that the price of a bag of rice (25 kg) has increased by Rs100 since the introduction of the advance tax, and the price of pulses has increased by Rs20 per kg.A study titled ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India’, undertaken by the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, lists rice as a key commodity ‘highly informally’ imported from India to Nepal.The paper said that only 40 percent of rice is imported to Nepal from India through the formal channel. The research shows that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, leading to a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.India, on the other hand, often bans the export of rice and other food commodities.With this variation, prices in Nepal and India differ by 18-20 percent, or rice in India becomes cheaper by at least 18 percent.The paper said that India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Hemraj Dhakal, vice president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that the government should withdraw such tax. “The taxation policy has harmed the domestic industry.” Various representatives from the Birgunj Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Siddharthnagar Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Nepal Chamber of Commerce, and the Confederation of Nepalese Industries have also demanded that the advance tax on food items be rolled back.Subodh Kumar Gupta, former president of the Association of Nepalese Rice, Oil and Pulses Industries, said that the government is losing revenue as illegal imports have thrived. “The new tax policy will not only make food items expensive, it will kill the domestic industry as well,\" he said.

The health budget also includes grants to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal Police Hospital, Nepal Army Hospital, Civil Hospital, and others. The national budget has announced a few new programmes, including the establishment of the Sita Dahal Memorial College of Naturopathy and Yogic Science under Kathmandu University. Sita Dahal is the late wife of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who died in July last year. Health experts said that the incumbent government neglected the health sector this year, too, as a slight increase in the annual budget does not help to continue the existing health programme.“How can we achieve the Sustainable Development Goals targets from the budget allocated to the health care sectors?” said Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, former chief specialist at the Ministry of Health and Population. “We need to bring qualitative change, and for that, huge investments are required.”Several healthcare programmes, including safe motherhood programmes, child health programmes, tuberculosis control, nutrition, vector control programmes, epidemic control, non-communicable diseases, and mental health programmes, have already been affected by the cut in the previous year’s budget.Likewise, the budget doesn't address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases.Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.Nepal has witnessed several outbreaks in recent years—dengue, cholera diarrheal diseases, and other vector-borne diseases. The country has failed to achieve the malaria elimination target.“Every hour, one person commits suicide, the burden of non-communicable diseases has increased alarmingly, and neonatal deaths have not declined in the past several years,” said Shrestha. “Several programmes of health, including a free screening of cervical cancer and renal problems in the state-run health facilities, could not be implemented due to various reasons. The budget allocated for health even does not support continuing the ongoing programmes.”Experts caution that budgetary cuts in crucial healthcare programmes would have a long-term impact and could affect the achievements made over the years.“The government has not allocated the health budget to strengthen the federal structures,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Chand, former chief of the Policy Planning and International Cooperation Division at the Ministry of Health. “Most of the health budget will be spent on the salaries of the staffers.” "},{"hash":"cbb26e3899f65b5ff4b495321d28b7eed1ffe8abf9d0d44995f4d6771fc7c7bd","title":"nepal-confirms-spread-of-new-covid-variant-kp-2-and-kp-1","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/05/24/nepal-confirms-spread-of-new-covid-variant-kp-2-and-kp-1","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb51-1716545366.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716508800000,"source":"kp","category":"health","content":"Nepal on Friday confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country.All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new cases of coronavirus in the last few weeks.The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of coronavirus-infected persons, said that 31 out of 42 swab samples tested positive for different sub-lineages.According to a statement issued by the laboratory, the KP.2 sub-variant was confirmed in 17 swab samples, KP.1 in 12, and KP.3 and KP.4 in one sample each.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges.

The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff.

Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally.

According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms.

Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many?

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. ","summary":"The gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place.

It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

Paudel played a brisk 35 runs off 37 balls to revive Nepal innings, but he never found support in the middle order as Kushal Malla (9), Dipendra Singh Airee (1) and Sompal Kami (0) all fell in quick succession.Paudel’s resistance also ended in the 16th over when Pringle had him caught by Max O’Dowd for his third wicket.Karan KC scored 12-ball 17 and Gulsan Jha played 15-ball 14 to take Nepal to 106 from 84-7, but the final three wickets tumbled swiftly and without adding a run after van Beek struck twice in successive balls in the 20th over.Paudel conceded they could have stretched their total a little further.“The conditions while batting were really challenging,” the Nepal skipper said. “Netherlands bowled really well. We could have stretched it a little more and had more partnerships through the middle.”The Netherlands captain Scott Edwards credited the bowlers for their match-winning show.\"Our bowlers were awesome,” he said. “We got two or three wickets in the powerplay.

","summary":"Nepal made a disastrous start to their 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World campaign on their return to the cricket’s biggest stage after a decade as they lost their opening match of the Group D to the Netherlands by six wickets in Dallas, Texas on Tuesday.Nepal, who were invited to bat first after losing the toss, posted a paltry 106 all out from 19.2 overs at the Grand Prairie Stadium after the batters struggled against a disciplined Dutch bowling.The Rhinos repeated the same mistakes with the bat as openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh failed to give their team a good start again after the play was slightly delayed due to wet outfield.Netherlands spinner Tim Pringle (3-20) and pacer Logan van Beek (3-18) were the biggest thorns in Nepal’s flesh as their three-wicket hauls put Nepal inside the pressure cooker in an overcast condition throughout the innings.In between, Paul van Meekeren and Bas de Leede also bowled excellently in the bowling-friendly surface, finishing 2-19 and 2-22, respectively.Nepal found themselves in big trouble early on at 15-2 in 3.1 overs when they lost Shiekh to Pringle for four in the second over and Bhurtel to van Beek for seven.Anil Sah departed next for 11 after Pringle had him caught by van Beek, leaving Nepal at 40-3.Skipper Rohit Paudel was the only batter who looked comfortable against the Dutch bowling attack that struck regularly. Paudel played a brisk 35 runs off 37 balls to revive Nepal innings, but he never found support in the middle order as Kushal Malla (9), Dipendra Singh Airee (1) and Sompal Kami (0) all fell in quick succession.Paudel’s resistance also ended in the 16th over when Pringle had him caught by Max O’Dowd for his third wicket.Karan KC scored 12-ball 17 and Gulsan Jha played 15-ball 14 to take Nepal to 106 from 84-7, but the final three wickets tumbled swiftly and without adding a run after van Beek struck twice in successive balls in the 20th over.Paudel conceded they could have stretched their total a little further.“The conditions while batting were really challenging,” the Nepal skipper said. “Netherlands bowled really well. We could have stretched it a little more and had more partnerships through the middle.”The Netherlands captain Scott Edwards credited the bowlers for their match-winning show.\"Our bowlers were awesome,” he said. “We got two or three wickets in the powerplay. All five of our bowlers were brilliant.”In response, Nepal bowled tightly, but could not stop O’Dowd to take the Dutch past the 107-run target with eight balls to spare. The Netherlands lost their opener Michael Levitt for a cheap one after Sompal Kami had him caught by Airee in 1.2 overs.But O’Dowd scored an unbeaten half-century to guide his side to 109-4 in 18.4 overs.O’Dowd smashed a patient knock of 48-ball 54 that featured four boundaries and one six.Despite a tenacious bowling attack, Nepal gave the Dutch the edge in the game after Sheikh, Kami and Paudel all dropped catches, which otherwise would have put their opponents under extra pressure.\"We did very well as a bowling unit,” Paudel said after the loss. “The last catch that I dropped was not well…and we didn't catch well.”Levitt and Singh, who played 22 runs off 28 balls, added 40 runs for the second wicket to steady the ship, before Sybrand Engelbrecht played 16-ball 14 to take the Dutch closer to the target.O’Dowd then smacked Abinash Bohara with two fours and six off the 19th over to wrap things up for the Dutch.“Ideally, we would have got the runs a little quicker, but it was great the way Max batted, and Bassie finished it off well,” Edwards said.Nepal next play against Sri Lanka on June 11.

Nepal, ranked 17th in the men’s T20I, are one of the top four highest-placed associated nations in the tournament. The young guns, led by 21-year-old captain Rohit Paudel, have the potential to cause an upset at the cricket tournament’s biggest stage and will aim to make history by progressing from the group stage.The top two teams from each of the four groups will reach the Super Eight stage. But their recent form—and a group including three full member nations and surprise elements the Netherlands—suggests that making it into the Super Eight will be difficult.Nepal will be making their first appearance at the World Cup since the World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. They have never qualified for the 50-over Cricket World Cup and are the least experienced side in the group.They are heading into the World Cup following a series of disappointing results, including the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup debacle and a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada.Inconsistencies with the bat have been one of their biggest headaches so far.Openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh have failed to live up to the billing lately, resulting in a failure to give the team a good start. Three years ago, on April 17, 2021, when the duo fearlessly put on a record-breaking 116-run opening stand against the Netherlands in their T20I debut in Kirtipur during the Nepal Tri-Nation T20I Series, the impression was that Nepal had finally found the missing piece of their top batting order.However, questions have been raised over their form as the opening duo has failed to build any impressive partnership recently, especially this year.Bhurtel—despite being one of the three Nepali batters alongside Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee to have crossed 1,000 T20I runs—is experiencing the worst year of his career and is showing no signs of improvement. In his last four T20I innings, he was dismissed for three ducks in a row during the Premier Cup, and for 10 runs against Canada during the World Cup warm-up. In between, he played knocks of 16, 2, 1 and 13 against West Indies A.Shiekh has also been unsteady with the bat. He scored a fifty against West Indies A and 22 against Canada in the World Cup warm-up but failed to cross double-digit figures in his previous four outings.Nepal’s batting display will heavily rely on skipper Paudel, who usually bats at number three, and big-hitter finisher Airee.Paudel is the most consistent batter in the Nepal squad. He is at his prime and entering the World Cup having scored 265 runs in his four innings that included a century and two half-centuries against West Indies A.Allrounder Airee holds the record for fastest T20I fifty. More recently, he entered the elite club when he smashed six sixes in an over against Qatar during the T20I Premier Cup, becoming the only third man to do so after Yuvraj Singh in 2007 and Keiron Pollard in 2021.Airee will certainly be the trump card of Nepal’s batting order at the World Cup.Kushal Malla, whose 34-ball hundred against Mongolia is the second fastest T20I century, is also expected to kindle fireworks.Nepal’s bowling unit will be another key strength at the World Cup, as they demonstrated in the warm-up game against Canada. They proved effective in the middle overs and struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries to limit Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over.All-rounder Sompal Kami—the only player from Nepal’s 2014 World Cup squad to feature in the 2024 edition—will bring hordes of experience in the bowling department and will lead the fast bowling alongside cult hero Karan KC, who is the highest wicket-taker in Nepal’s squad with 90 wickets from 68 innings.Lalit Rajbanshi will lead the spin threat alongside Sagar Dhakal, who is proving his worth by taking seven wickets in his last four matches.However, all eyes will be on Abinash Bohara, who will be crucial for Nepal at the back end of the innings as the majority of his wickets have come in the death overs. Since making his debut in 2019, Bohara has taken 74 wickets from 56 innings, which is the third highest for Nepal.Nepal will still be the heavy underdogs in the group, especially against 2014 world champions Sri Lanka and 2009 and 2014 semi-finalists South Africa. This will be the first time Nepal will face Sri Lanka and South Africa. Paudel, who is the youngest captain in the United States and the West Indies among the 20 participating nations, believes Nepal can do well at the World Cup. “I have faith in my team. They will give their best, be it in opening batting or other departments,” said Paudel, who added that the role of openers would be important. “It is upon the opening batters to get the team off to a good start,” he added.“In T20 cricket, no team is really a favourite. The Netherlands defeated Sri Lanka in the warm-up game. The United States beat Bangladesh twice for a historic 2-1 series victory. That’s why I believe we can and we will [compete].”If Nepal are to build momentum for the Super Eight stage, they will need to overcome their first hurdle against familiar foes Netherlands, who are making their fifth appearance at the T20 World Cup. But it will not be an easy task against the tricky Dutch, who are on the verge of completing a hat-trick of wins against the Proteas after defeating them in the 2022 T20 World Cup and the 2023 Cricket World Cup.“Our team is focused on the Netherlands match because it is very important for us to win that game and carry the thrust to the following matches. Our players are also well aware of their respective roles,” Paudel added.Nepal can also present a thrilling challenge to a Bangladesh team, who are reeling after hitting a new low after losing a series against inexperienced and tournament debutants, the US. The Tigers also lost to Zimbabwe by eight wickets in a T20I series earlier this month.This will be the second meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh. In fact, Bangladesh defeated Nepal by eight wickets in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup and progressed into the second round. The Bangladeshis have never made it to the knockout stages across eight editions of the tournament.

The United States will begin their World Cup campaign against Canada in the inaugural match of the tournament on June 1.Photos: Hemanta Shrestha "},{"hash":"65418df7eb296d4d457d75fc63bdb8922774ab80b0913bffe84325ea5ce6b656","title":"israel-says-jets-strike-school-containing-hamas-compound-gaza-media-says-27-killed","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/06/06/israel-says-jets-strike-school-containing-hamas-compound-gaza-media-says-27-killed","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/JNMAGEC5ZRPO5CPZFCHMH3NTIM-1717652071.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717632000000,"source":"kp","category":"world","content":"Israel targeted a Gaza school on Thursday that it said contained a Hamas compound, killing fighters involved in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the eight-month war, but Gaza media said the strike killed at least 27 people seeking shelter.Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's claims that the UN school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.“The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,” Thawabta told Reuters.Israel's military said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.The attack happened after Israel announced a new military campaign in central Gaza as it battles a group of fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics.

In general, this is a path to very serious problems,” Putin said.Putin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.President Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch some US-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range US-supplied weapons.British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so.NUCLEAR RISKSpeaking to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin touched on subjects from the war in Gaza to the upcoming US election.“No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness.”Putin said Russia did not care who the next US president was but said the US court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Republican nominee Donald Trump.“They are burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system ... It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump, especially in court on charges that were formed on the basis of events that happened years ago, without direct proof, is simply using the judicial system in an internal political struggle,” said Putin.More than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.When asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia’s nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.“For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,” Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning.“We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone’s actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.”Russia’s published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia “when the very existence of the state is put under threat.”NATO ATTACK?Putin casts the conflict in Ukraine as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine.Putin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a U.S.-backed coup.The West describes the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.Ukraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control and which Moscow now considers to be parts of Russia.Western leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia’s warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia but have repeatedly warned Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world’s most powerful military alliance.Both Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia, the world’s biggest nuclear power, and U.S.-led NATO would be a step towards World War Three.“You should not make Russia out to be the enemy.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) ","summary":"Nepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad.

If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while.

It is expected that India’s foreign policy towards its neighbours will continue with its ‘neighbourhood first’ and ‘first responder’ policies. In the past 10 years of the Modi government, the focus has largely remained on infrastructure and connectivity with the neighbourhood to strengthen the region’s economic integration. Moreover, India’s foreign policy continues from the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, as there is a basic underlying consensus among the political parties on the contours of India’s neighbourhood policy. The primacy of this policy has been based on stability in the neighbourhood, which has a salutary effect on India’s stability and economic development in the border areas. This cannot be separated from economic development in neighbouring countries and the establishment of broader partnerships in a geo-economic sense.Manifestos and foreign policy Manifestos provide a glimpse into political parties’ thinking on foreign policy. However, policy decisions are made considering larger geopolitical developments, India’s security imperatives and geo-economic impulses in the context of other significant global players and their regional interests. In the recent election, the manifestos of all major political parties focused on domestic issues. Unlike in the past, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) manifesto focused on ‘Bharat first’ foreign policy. Leading the global south has always been a priority of India’s foreign policy, evident in the Non-alignment policy, South-South cooperation, Group of 77 and Afro-Asian conference, where India played a leading role. Interestingly, the Modi government prioritised the global south when it took the G20 Presidency in 2023. Notably, the government’s policy on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is mentioned in the section on surakshit bharat.Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief are other areas that India has focused on in the past as its outreach has expanded through maritime collaboration and strengthening vision through the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy. As India’s emphasis on infrastructure grows, the India-Middle East-Economic Corridor—the Modi government’s initiative—will get a boost along with the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). Additionally, the development of Chabahar Port will provide an edge to India’s economic outreach. Developing strategic partnerships for mineral security would be a new initiative of the incoming NDA government. Digital public infrastructure has always been the Modi government’s priority. Perhaps considering the voters from the southern states of India, the BJP spoke of establishing Thiruvalluvar cultural centres worldwide in its manifesto. It is, however, unclear where this centre would be in addition to the Indian Cultural centres that India has established across the world. Energy security, green energy and border infrastructure would remain important, and this is where an attempt would be made to connect with neighbours. The master plan for Purvodaya integrated infrastructure development for the Eastern states of India would boost infrastructure development in the Eastern part of South Asia, as BBIN and BIMSTEC nations are contiguous to this region. Both the BJP and Indian National Congress (INC) are committed to opposing terrorism in all its forms and taking steps to counter state-sponsored terrorism. There has been a larger political consensus on this issue in the past. Dialogue with Pakistan will not be possible in the near future unless Islamabad commits to taking steps to ensure that its territory is not used for terrorism against India. One has seen the military government of Musharraf pledge in the past. Moreover, India’s stand on removing Article 370 is non-negotiable, and there is a broad political consensus.The Indian National Congress has emphasised free trade and a rule-based international order. It is important to note that the INC and its INDIA partner would ‘uphold continuity in India’s foreign policy’ as promised in its manifesto. Therefore, there will not be any divergence in India’s foreign policy in general and in its neighbourhood in particular. The INC’s manifesto also emphasises the global south and multilateral institutions. Neighbourhood policyThe BJP will continue its policies towards India’s neighbours, prioritising robust economic partnership through trade, infrastructure and energy connectivity, which will spur growth. Its manifesto touched on the government's broader foreign policy agenda, with an emphasis on ‘neighbourhood first’. The INC, however, has made special efforts to outline its approach towards India’s neighbourhood. It is important to note that the foreign policy approach of the opposition is crucial because they are members of the Parliamentary Committee on External Affairs, where issues of foreign policy are discussed threadbare in which the opposition participates. The INC has devoted a section to India’s neighbourhood, for example, prioritising India’s special relationship with Nepal and Bhutan to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship. India’s relationship with Nepal has been unstable over the territorial dispute, and both are currently discussing ways to resolve the issue. Both INC and BJP emphasise negotiation to resolve problems between India and Nepal. They are enhancing the economic and cultural relationship with Bangladesh, which is already on track, especially the economic relationship with Bangladesh where bilateral trade is touching almost $18 billion. It needs to be underlined that during Manmohan Singh’s government, India had extended zero tariffs on 61 products—out of which 48 products were related to Bangladesh’s garment industries, which is a major contributor to the nation’s GDP. The INC also speaks of enhancing the political and economic relationship with Sri Lanka. On both economic and political counts, ECTA is still under negotiation, even though the Tamil ethnic issue remains a problem. India has emphasised addressing the grievances of Tamils in Sri Lanka, which also has implications for India as it continues to host Tamil refugees who fled Sri Lanka due to the ethnic conflict there. Sri Lanka is poised for the presidential election, followed by the parliamentary election this year. These issues would remain hotly debated in Sri Lanka’s domestic politics. In this context, regional parties in Tamil Nadu would be essential in shaping India’s policy towards Sri Lanka. The INC has promised to repair the relationship with the Maldives. However, the Modi government has taken steps to engage with the Muizzu government in the Maldives to ensure that the relationship does not suffer from the nationalist electoral rhetoric that was a part of Muizzu’s election campaign. Though INC is candid about human rights violations in Myanmar, it is unlikely that India would adopt any stringent measures against Myanmar’s military regime especially when India’s vital security interests are at stake. It is equally concerned about the cross-border implications of the conflict in Myanmar on its population in the ethnically volatile North East region.Wither foreign policyBoth the incumbent BJP’s manifesto and that of the INC, which would be in opposition, suggest that there will be no drastic changes in foreign policy. The manifestos are not divergent, and the sum and substance remain the same. Both parties have similar views on resuming dialogue with Pakistan. There is an emphasis on infrastructure development that has now become an integral part of trade and economic integration. A stable neighbourhood is entwined with India’s security, given the porosity of the border and ethnocultural cross-border linkages. The political parties in India know that a stakeholder’s approach to each other’s prosperity and security would shape a mutually beneficial relationship. India’s global outreach and place in the emerging global order would shape its foreign policy.

Dialogue with Pakistan will not be possible in the near future unless Islamabad commits to taking steps to ensure that its territory is not used for terrorism against India. One has seen the military government of Musharraf pledge in the past. Moreover, India’s stand on removing Article 370 is non-negotiable, and there is a broad political consensus.The Indian National Congress has emphasised free trade and a rule-based international order. It is important to note that the INC and its INDIA partner would ‘uphold continuity in India’s foreign policy’ as promised in its manifesto. Therefore, there will not be any divergence in India’s foreign policy in general and in its neighbourhood in particular. The INC’s manifesto also emphasises the global south and multilateral institutions. Neighbourhood policyThe BJP will continue its policies towards India’s neighbours, prioritising robust economic partnership through trade, infrastructure and energy connectivity, which will spur growth. Its manifesto touched on the government's broader foreign policy agenda, with an emphasis on ‘neighbourhood first’. The INC, however, has made special efforts to outline its approach towards India’s neighbourhood. It is important to note that the foreign policy approach of the opposition is crucial because they are members of the Parliamentary Committee on External Affairs, where issues of foreign policy are discussed threadbare in which the opposition participates. The INC has devoted a section to India’s neighbourhood, for example, prioritising India’s special relationship with Nepal and Bhutan to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship. India’s relationship with Nepal has been unstable over the territorial dispute, and both are currently discussing ways to resolve the issue. Both INC and BJP emphasise negotiation to resolve problems between India and Nepal. They are enhancing the economic and cultural relationship with Bangladesh, which is already on track, especially the economic relationship with Bangladesh where bilateral trade is touching almost $18 billion. It needs to be underlined that during Manmohan Singh’s government, India had extended zero tariffs on 61 products—out of which 48 products were related to Bangladesh’s garment industries, which is a major contributor to the nation’s GDP. The INC also speaks of enhancing the political and economic relationship with Sri Lanka. On both economic and political counts, ECTA is still under negotiation, even though the Tamil ethnic issue remains a problem. India has emphasised addressing the grievances of Tamils in Sri Lanka, which also has implications for India as it continues to host Tamil refugees who fled Sri Lanka due to the ethnic conflict there. Sri Lanka is poised for the presidential election, followed by the parliamentary election this year. These issues would remain hotly debated in Sri Lanka’s domestic politics. In this context, regional parties in Tamil Nadu would be essential in shaping India’s policy towards Sri Lanka. The INC has promised to repair the relationship with the Maldives. However, the Modi government has taken steps to engage with the Muizzu government in the Maldives to ensure that the relationship does not suffer from the nationalist electoral rhetoric that was a part of Muizzu’s election campaign. Though INC is candid about human rights violations in Myanmar, it is unlikely that India would adopt any stringent measures against Myanmar’s military regime especially when India’s vital security interests are at stake. It is equally concerned about the cross-border implications of the conflict in Myanmar on its population in the ethnically volatile North East region.Wither foreign policyBoth the incumbent BJP’s manifesto and that of the INC, which would be in opposition, suggest that there will be no drastic changes in foreign policy. The manifestos are not divergent, and the sum and substance remain the same. Both parties have similar views on resuming dialogue with Pakistan. There is an emphasis on infrastructure development that has now become an integral part of trade and economic integration. A stable neighbourhood is entwined with India’s security, given the porosity of the border and ethnocultural cross-border linkages. The political parties in India know that a stakeholder’s approach to each other’s prosperity and security would shape a mutually beneficial relationship. India’s global outreach and place in the emerging global order would shape its foreign policy.

The world’s largest democratic elections have thrown in a legion of interesting anecdotes, surprises and shocks that the media will bring to light in the coming weeks, but the most important story today is that the politics of hate that had become a mainstay of Indian politics in the past decade under Modi has faced a setback. At least for now. Divider-in-chief With two untrustworthy coalition partners, Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu, pledging their allegiance to the National Democratic Alliance, Modi is set to return to power for a third time since he stormed into New Delhi’s power corridors in 2014. Technically, this is a feat only Jawaharlal Nehru before him had achieved in independent India. But make no mistake—Modi is no Nehru, and any attempt at equating the two is blasphemy in the realm of democracy. Nehru’s electoral campaigns—in 1951-52, 1957 and 1962—focused on communal harmony, development and nation-building. Having emerged from the clutches of British colonialism, a bloody partition and a defeat with China, India under Nehru was a nation awaking to life and freedom, a long-suppressed soul finding its utterance as Panditji prophesied in his midnight-hour speech. Conversely, Modi has upended the founding ideas of a secular, democratic India, oiling as he did the gigantic social-bureaucratic machinery with communal hatred. As the desperation for fresh air even among his most trusted voters in the Hindi heartland became apparent, Modi doubled up on bigotry even as he rained insults on his opponents, demonised the marginalised community, and hypnotised millions of Indians into looking for an enemy among their compatriots. Once he started believing his own fantasy of creating an opposition-free India, he did all that could be done in a political culture bereft of morality—throwing opposition politicians behind bars, scuttling free speech, suppressing the media, and manipulating a section of Indians into believing that “Hindu khatre mein hain”. Another Gujarat modelIt is interesting [read scary] how Modi continued to change his enemies over the years to bring India where it is today. In 2014, his enemy was poverty, as he fought elections with a commitment to bringing “achchhe din”, a so-called replica of his Gujarat model of development. In 2019, his enemy was Pakistan, as he projected his image, in the wake of the Pulwama terrorist attacks, as a valiant fighter who would enter the enemy’s house and kill them. Come 2024, his enemy turned out to be his own people—the Muslims. Not that the Muslims were spared in Modi’s previous terms—he continued to maintain deafening silence even as Muslims, and in some cases, Dalits, were lynched by far-right Hindutva mobs in broad daylight. As Modi focused his attention on transforming his image from “vikas purush” to “Hindu hriday samrat” and finally a demigod—he confessed, to the embarrassment of his devout bhakts, that he was born of divine power and not his biological mother—he failed to realise that the demons of communalism, once unleashed, resist a return even to the master. It was as if a metaphorical Gujarat model he hates to be reminded of was manifesting itself. No matter how hard he tries, he has failed to erase from public memory the pictures of the city that burned for three days, with Hindus and Muslims killing each other, even as he kept saying “Mera Gujarat jal raha hai”, as his character, played by Vivek Oberoi, shows in his hagiographical film, PM Narendra Modi.After the humbug, the humblingSo triggering was the very presence of Modi at the helm that liberal Indians are celebrating Modi’s failure to garner a majority for the BJP this time although he is set to come back. That was the level of expectation among the people of the world’s largest democracy. Surely, the electorate was tired of the Hindu-Muslim rhetoric the Right-wing politicians and media anchors repeated day and night. Equally, the zeal of the opposition to keep fighting despite being hit below the belt persistently helped the people see the option they had been overlooking. Especially, the fight-back of the opposition is also the story of the coming-of-age of Rahul Gandhi. The so-called “Pappu” is back with a bang. But the Modi era is far from over yet. Despite the change in the numbers, Modi will remain at the centre of Indian politics, albeit with a loss of sleep over a possible paltibaaji by his partners.

The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. ","summary":"The CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths.

Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   ","summary":"United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles.

This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses.

How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   "},{"hash":"b8cf800b128e5429effac6538b5cdeff14e12e5c92d4968c239f48ce105eb283","title":"interview-with-padam-giri","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/05/05/interview-with-padam-giri","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/padamgiri-1714923097.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714867200000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"The budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally.
