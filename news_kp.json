        "content": "China on Sunday announced exempting visa fees for Nepali travellers starting May 1 and launching of commercial flights to Nepal’s two new international airports, which are marred by geopolitics, under Beijing's renewed economic diplomacy for Nepal.India, on the other hand, said it would make Nepal prosperous through hydro energy trade.Speaking at the third Nepal Investment Summit in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu, Luo Zhaohui, the chairman of China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), said the Chinese government will continue to attach great importance to direct and indirect investment in Nepal to implement the Trans-Himalaya dimensional connectivity, which is the highest priority for countries.“Air and road links and border checkpoints are going well. Feasibility studies of the cross-border railway and cross-border transmission lines are moving forward,” he said. “That’s why, today’s summit is of very special significance.”The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini. “In this regard, I have good news to share with you that from May 1, or after three days, there will be no visa fee for the Nepali people to [visit] China,” said Luo.Nepal's $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country's tourism capital, funded by Beijing, opened in January last year. Similarly, Nepal's second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started its operation in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objective of both projects is to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, to bring in more tourists, and stop Nepalis from going abroad. But no single international flight is operating in the two new shiny airports, which critics say is due to the air route issue, which India is reluctant to provide to Nepal. Without entry routes from the southwestern points, these airports have higher operating costs for any airlines entering Nepal from the west. Nepal has been prodding New Delhi for over a decade to open new air corridors but to no avail. The air route issue, however, does not affect Chinese airlines as they enter and exit Nepal from the northern and eastern border points of Nepal.Luo said that one of the major achievements between the two neighbours is the agreement to build the Trans Himalaya All-dimensional Connectivity Network. “Last September, Nepal’s Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal paid an official visit to China. Our leaders have reached an important consensus guiding our future cooperation. All these fruits are in the process of implementation.”“I’m satisfied to note that more than 350 entrepreneurs from China participated in today's function. It shows how the Chinese government and Chinese entrepreneurs show their strong interest in Nepal.”One of the important policies the Chinese entrepreneurs are quite interested in is to have a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) arrangements between the two countries, he said.An FTA reduces barriers to imports and exports between countries by eliminating all or most tariffs, quotas, subsidies, and prohibitions. “That will be a key to improving Nepal’s investment environment to attract more Chinese investment,” said Luo ending his speech with a Chinese saying, “Build a good nest to attract the phoenix.”The third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit brought together more than 1,100 foreign participants in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, mostly from two immediate neighbours India and China.To mark the beginning of the summit, the Investment Board Nepal, on Sunday, invited Expressions of Interest (EOI) for 12 projects from potential investors. The government has offered 148 potential projects, with nearly Rs900 billion worth of ready-to-go projects, to foreign and domestic investors. Most projects, according to the Investment Board Nepal, are related to hydropower, and officials are hopeful that the sector will attract investment from energy-hungry India.While China claimed that it currently is the top source of FDI for Nepal, India said it has the highest FDI stock in Nepal.Naveen Srivastava, ambassador of India to Nepal, said India currently is the biggest cumulative FDI investor in Nepal, with more than 33 percent of Nepal's FDI stock, which amounts to about Rs89 billion. “This investment trend continues its positive trajectory, and in recent times, we've seen new investments coming in sectors such as construction, automobiles, or FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods]. This is apart from the huge investment that India and Indian companies are making in the hydropower sector. As we look to the future, the government of India will continue to encourage Indian industry to invest further in Nepal.”“The large presence of the Indian delegation today is a reflection of that commitment. We would also be launching a new investment guide for investment by Indian companies in Nepal in collaboration with the Nepal India Chambers of Commerce and Industry,” he said.“We've launched cross-border digital payments to facilitate an ever greater number of Indian tourists coming to Nepal. Indian tourists already constitute the largest number of foreign visitors to Nepal. In the last few years, hydropower exports from Nepal to India have added a new dimension to our ties. Last year alone, Nepal exported about 650 MW of power to India, earning a considerable revenue, which constituted about 10 percent of Nepal's total export to India or 7 percent of Nepal's global exports.”To further foster this, Nepal and India have also concluded a long-term agreement on power trade.“At present, we are also discussing a trilateral power trade between India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The vast demand for clean energy in South Asia with a combined population of close to two billion people provides an opportunity for Nepal to further boost its hydropower potential and economic development,” said Srivastava.In his video messages, Piyush Goyal, India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, said Nepal is a key partner in India's Neighbourhood First policy. “We will continue to invest in Nepal. We will continue to expand our trading and business relationship.” “I urge Indian investors across the globe to invest in Nepal, to seize the opportunity, and become a part of emerging Nepal.”Sushil Sharma, chairman and managing director of SJVN Limited, an India-based company engaged in the power generation, said SJVN started its journey in Nepal in 2008 by signing a memorandum of understanding for the 900 MW Arun III Hydroelectric Project. “And since then, we have moved a long way developing three hydro projects of around 2,000 MW, which are under different stages of implementation.”He said that the enactment of the Public-Private Partnership and Investment Act in 2019 was one such major initiative of Nepal. “The expeditious clearance of Lower Arun detailed project report [DPR] in a record time of 90 days, which has not happened in India itself.” SJVN Limited is developing 57 gigawatts of power projects in the fields of hydro, solar, wind, thermal energy, and out of these, 2,200 MW are hydropower projects in Nepal, and investments of more than Rs330 billion will be drawn to implement the Nepal-based projects, said Sharma.“I would like to highlight that SJVN is committed to generating more than 5,000 MW of hydropower in Nepal by 2030,” he said.“India has signed an agreement for importing 10,000 MW of electricity from Nepal. However, we know the electricity market has now converted from a seller's market into a buyer's market, especially concerning India. Therefore, the development of hydro projects in Nepal requires time-bound and cost-effective completion so that the power generated in Nepal remains competitive in the export market,” said Sharma.“I would also like to draw the attention of the government on their part towards areas where improvement is still required, especially laws regarding the acquisition of private and forest land for timely completion of ongoing projects.“As such, all necessary regulations in transmission infrastructure need to be framed at the earliest to achieve this ambitious target for which, the government of Nepal is humbly requested to delegate more powers to the Investment Board Nepal.”Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal inaugurated the two-day summit.In his remarks, Dahal said that Nepal provides several incentives to foreign investors, including a robust regulatory framework, provision for the avoidance of double taxation, protection of intellectual property rights, and competitive corporate taxation, among others, and urged foreigners to invest in Nepal.“Nepal has recently approved the Bilateral Investment Agreement (BIA) framework, which aims to protect and promote bilateral investment. I encourage all our friendly nations to consider signing the BIA at the earliest.”The prime minister said that the skilled workforce and low labour costs make Nepal an attractive proposition for international investors. “Provisions of national and non-discriminatory treatment for all FDIs and guaranteed repatriation in foreign currency further enhance the attractiveness of investing in Nepal.”Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said the main objective of the summit is to project Nepal as an emerging destination for private sector investment and to highlight recent reforms in enhancing the investment climate and ensuring regulatory frameworks that support foreign as well as domestic investment.“To improve the business environment and boost investors' confidence, we have initiated various policy reforms. These reforms include improving regulatory processes, reducing the time and cost of business, and ensuring transparency and accountability in public sector governance. Reform is an ongoing process, it will be continued in the days to come,” said Pun.President of the Nepali Congress and former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said, “Nepal is still a least developed country. We confront huge development challenges. While our country has huge potential for development, we lack adequate capital and appropriate technology to realise development benefits. In this context, the convening of this high-level event assumes a particular significance.”Deuba said that flexible labour laws, a demographic dividend with a substantial share of the young and energetic population, a reliable supply of electricity, and the availability of local raw materials also contribute to making production costs low compared to other high-wage countries in the region.“Moreover, all major political parties remain committed to promoting foreign investment in Nepal and come together to foster consensus on key investment-related issues. We do not pursue discriminatory policies towards foreign investors. They are treated on par with national investors. We welcome foreign investors as our valued guests.”Atul Keshap, senior vice president for South Asia at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that the commitment made by Nepal to lasting reforms would enable the country’s business environment and private sector to truly flourish and generate sustainable, inclusive, and resilient growth for Nepal’s citizens.“This Investment Summit presents the opportunity to further enact economic reforms that will truly open Nepal to global markets and world-leading businesses. Creating a more level playing field for foreign companies, building regulatory predictability and mechanisms for stakeholder inputs, and focusing on ease of doing business will generate further investment interest in Nepal.”President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) Chandra Prasad Dhakal urged investors from around the world to seize the opportunity and invest in Nepal's burgeoning economy.Dhakal highlighted Nepal's strategic location between the economic powerhouses China and India, underscoring its significance as a gateway to vast markets. He emphasised the abundant opportunities across various sectors, including tourism, infrastructure, energy, agriculture, technology, and ICT. "

        "content": "In a rare move, the Supreme Court has launched a suo moto contempt of court case against the publisher and the editor of sidhakura.com, a Kathmandu-based news website, for allegedly publishing defamatory content against one of its justices.Govinda Ghimire, a deputy registrar at the top court, filed the writ petition claiming that serious fabricated and illusionary audiovisual content published by the website was a malicious attempt to defame the judiciary. Thus it is a contempt of court, Ghimire has claimed. “The series of illusionary content uploaded by the online is an attempt to tarnish the judiciary’s image and an attack on judicial integrity,” reads a part of the petition. It has demanded a maximum punishment against Yubraj Kandel and Nabin Dhungana, the publisher and the editor of the website, respectively, and against their team members.The petition was filed as per Article 128(4) of the Constitution of Nepal, section 17(1) of the Judicial Administration Act and Supreme Court regulations.In case anyone causes obstruction in the dispensation of justice or disregards any order or judgment handed down by it or any of its subordinate courts, the court may, in accordance with the law, initiate proceedings of contempt, says the constitutional provision. Similarly, the Act allows the court to initiate contempt of court proceedings if it finds anything that is posing hurdles to discharging its duties.The news website in its audiovisual content has claimed that the chairpersons of two leading media houses were a part of a meeting with the incumbent and former Supreme Court justices and senior advocates to dismiss over 400 corruption cases in the court. The content, which the online claims is based on a sting operation, is nothing but a malicious move intended to defame the judiciary, the petitioner has claimed.The petitioner has demanded an order for immediate removal of the content from YouTube and other social media, and summoning the individuals involved in the production and dissemination of the defamatory content for their statements, to ensure that such acts do not recur. Stating that production and publication of such content is a criminal offence, the petitioner has also sought an order against relevant government agencies for investigation into the content and regular reporting to the court. The hearing of the petition has been slated for Monday.“Launching suo moto cases is a standard practice in the judiciary worldwide although it is not very common here,” senior advocate Dinesh Tripathi, a former chairperson of the Constitutional Lawyers’ Forum, told the Post. “The Supreme Court has rightly initiated the case since its senior justice has been accused in the so-called sting operation.”Amid criticism over the content, the Press Council on Friday had directed the news website to take down the ‘malicious and fabricated’ content and present a written clarification for broadcasting it. But its management refused to abide by the directive. It instead published another episode on Saturday.The move of the news website has been condemned by the media and civil society organisations. The Nepal Media Society on Saturday condemned the content saying it was published with a malicious intent to defame members of the media and the judiciary and demanded immediate action against those involved.The umbrella body of Nepal-based media organisations had called the video a condemnable attempt to attack the democratic system, media and judiciary without any basis and demanded that relevant authorities take action against all those involved in the act. It had also claimed that such irresponsible and ‘propaganda mills’ cannot be considered media.“There has been a rising trend of misusing technology to attack democratic systems and independent media and the judiciary, motivated by blind public support, worldwide,” read a statement issued by Shuva Shankar Kandel, chair of the society. “The latest incident is a similar attempt by some YouTube channels that are producing tasteless ‘fake news’, which is a serious issue.”Earlier, senior advocate Hari Prasad Upreti and advocate Kishor Bista also issued a joint statement denying the allegations levelled against them in the audio clip. The content in question and its publication is misleading and we believe that this is a deliberate attack on the judiciary and the media, they said. “We vehemently oppose anyone who shares and defends such content on social media.”Supreme Court Justice Ananda Mohan Bhattarai, who is named in the clip, objected to the content saying that it was motivated by the intent of spreading disbelief not only against the media houses and individuals but also against professional journalism and the judiciary as a whole.“I am shocked and surprised that my name has been linked with the news published by ‘Sidha Kura.’ My career, spanning almost 43 years, is an open book,” Bhattarai said.Kantipur Media Group chairperson Kailash Sirohiya and Rameshwar Thapa, chairman of the Annapurna Media Network, who are also accused of being involved in the case, had filed separate complaints at the Press Council arguing that the online portal had attempted to undermine the pillars of the democratic system, therefore, needs to be investigated and held accountable for its action.Meanwhile, the council has ordered the editor and presenter of sidhakura.com to appear before the council’s office at Tilganga, Kathmandu by 3 pm on Monday along with evidence to substantiate the accusations made in the disputed content published by them.

        "content": "A few weeks ago, an eight-month-old baby girl from Arubari in the Capital was rushed to the Chabahil-based Om Hospital and Research Center, as the child was experiencing shortness of breath.The child’s parents told the doctor that the baby didn't have a fever but would make a wheezing sound while exhaling.“The baby was suffering from childhood asthma,” said Dr Rita Hamal, a consultant paediatrician at the hospital. “We admitted her and provided oxygen therapy. It took three days for her condition to improve.”As the Capital’s air quality continues to worsen, often reaching hazardous levels, this is a common refrain among hundreds of children brought to hospitals for treatment of childhood asthma.The ongoing forest fires, vehicular and industrial emissions, and the burning of agriculture residue throughout the country have made the air toxic, exacerbating asthma problems in small children.A recent report by Save the Children shows critical linkages between air pollution and multi-faceted hazards for children.The report titled “Breathless Future: Unveiling the Impacts of Air Pollution on Children and Women in Kathmandu and Saptari” shows the systemic impact of air pollution on various aspects of children's lives. The report also explored the effects of air pollution on women and underrepresented groups.“Deteriorating air quality, both outdoors and indoors, has exposed children and women to a multitude of health hazards— asthma, other lung conditions, coughing, skin disease, nausea, and headache,” reads the report. “ Alarmingly, these conditions have led to increased cases of pregnancy loss, child organ underdevelopment, and a general decline in life expectancy.”The study carried out in Kathmandu and Saptari, two of the most polluted districts in the country, highlights a significant knowledge gap related to air pollution, including its effects in indoor settings and associated health risks, particularly for women and children who spend extensive periods inside their homes. Experts say the deterioration of air quality seriously affects public health. Poor air quality causes both short- and long-term effects on public health. Bad air quality can cause pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke and heart problems, among others, in the short term, ulcers and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease and heart problems in the long run.People living in areas with high levels of air pollution are most likely to suffer from asthma, and small children are not immune to these problems, according to doctors. “Earlier more children would suffer from pneumonia,” said Dr Ganesh Rai, former director at the Kanti Children’s Hospital, Kathmandu. “These days, cases of childhood asthma have surpassed pneumonia.”Child health experts say that in most cases childhood asthma can be cured by an appropriate and timely treatment but uncontrolled asthma can lead to lung damage. In many cases, parents mistake asthma for pneumonia. Some parents are unaware of the signs, and the children could suffer from asthma, although asthma is commonly associated with the elderly.“Polluted air has exacerbated childhood asthma in our country, this fact should be understood by all,” said Rai. “Oftentimes, when children do not show fever or other symptoms, parents unknowingly overlook asthma and do not take the children to hospital for too long. It is crucial to seek medical help if a child has shortness of breath, trouble sleeping, or wheezing while breathing out.”Apart from polluted air, several other triggering factors including allergies, family history of asthma, and frequent respiratory illnesses are also responsible for childhood asthma, according to doctors. Studies show that polluted air has been shortening the lives of Nepali people. Polluted air has been cutting short the lives of Nepali people by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively.The reduction in life expectancy depends on where one lives—7.5 years in Mahottari, 7.4 years in Rautahat and Dhanusha, and 7.2 years in Sarlahi and Bara districts, the AQLI report said. Likewise, the pollution has been shaving 6.7 years off the lives of people residing in Siraha, and 6.2 years in Saptari and Rupandehi districts. "

        "category": "interviews",
        "content": "People lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. "

        "content": "Artist Ranju Yadav believes she has grown a lot—both in her career and as a person. She remembers being nervous to even attend art exhibitions and converse with people about a decade ago, but now she is flying across Europe for a solo exhibition, representing Nepal in Germany, Denmark and Finland.Founder of Mithila Hastakala Udyog in Rajbiraj and the recipient of the National Fine Art Award at the National Fine Arts Exhibition 2019, Yadav has participated in over two dozen exhibitions. She has exhibited her works at events like the Karnaphuli Folk Triennale in Bangladesh, the International Art Exhibition in Myanmar, the Nepal Art Fair in Bangladesh, and the SAARC exhibition in Maldives.Yadav was born in Thalha, Saptari, and learned Mithila art from the female members of her family. Even as a kid, she loved painting and often played around with colours. She moved to Rajbiraj when she was 15, right after her father passed away. Later, when she was in college, she moved to Kathmandu and began painting professionally. In 2011, over dinner, Ajit Shah, a friend of her husband, who is also a Mithila artist, noticed Yadav’s drawings and paintings. Impressed, he urged her to consider painting professionally. With a background in Mithila art, she quickly learned to paint on canvas. She wanted to use Mithila art as a tool for social change and activism. When she was in ninth grade, she witnessed a tragic incident near Rajbiraj, where a girl was killed by her in-laws over dowry. In eleventh grade, she saw a man driven to madness by dowry pressure after marrying off his daughters. These events left a deep impact on her. She started questioning the reason behind such injustices and why no one took action to eradicate them.Since then, she has fostered a desire to effect positive change through her work. She views paintings as a potent means to address social issues and instigate change. “I strongly believe that art has the power to transform society,” she states. She addresses issues like dowry, child marriage, caste discrimination and social disparities through her work. Yadav believes that many girls and women struggle to combat gender violence and discrimination because of their lack of independence and financial autonomy. She wants to raise awareness about these issues and contribute to the fight (against them).At her first solo exhibition, ‘Colours of Change’ in 2019, Yadav’s painting of a groom’s head on a bull’s body drew a lot of attention. She wanted to show how people who accept dowry are foolish, akin to bulls. The then Swiss ambassador to Nepal, Elisabeth von Capeller, was so impressed with it that she invited Yadav to exhibit it at the Swiss Embassy.Four years later, in 2023, Yadav received a heartening call from two individuals from Madhesh, who shared that they had married without dowry after being inspired by her paintings.Yadav has been painting professionally for thirteen years now and she shares that it’s moments like these, where she can see how her work is impacting people, even if it is just a little, that keep her motivated despite the challenges.She started participating in group exhibitions in 2017, which was initially daunting for her. She remembers feeling intimidated and nervous about attending exhibitions when she first moved to Kathmandu.Yadav calls her husband her “biggest supporter”, who has encouraged her to create her own identity beyond traditional roles and insisted she be known as Ranju rather than “Amarendra’s wife”. He also helped her overcome her anxiety about conversing with others. To date, the biggest challenge for Yadav has been balancing her home life and work, particularly due to the social expectations placed on women. In the art industry, attending events and networking is essential. However, when she visited Bangladesh in 2018 for an exhibition, many close to her criticised her for travelling alone and not taking her husband with her.Consequently, she took a three-year hiatus to raise her second child, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, but felt anxious about falling behind in her career. When she shared her worries, they were completely dismissed as people thought she should be grateful about having children and getting to raise them, instead of worrying about her career.Yadav, however, believes that women should have identities beyond being mothers or wives.Similarly, when she faced financial struggles at the start of her career, many of her relatives urged her to quit, but she couldn’t bring herself to do so. “I felt like I wouldn’t be able to live if I left art,” she says. So she persisted.Coming from a middle-class background in Madhesh, Yadav had a difficult time establishing herself in Kathmandu’s art scene, where Madheshi representation is scarce. She notes that the prevalent misconceptions and stereotypes surrounding Madhesi individuals are about dowry, violence and traditionalism.To confront and change these unfair stereotypes, Yadav chose to pursue Mithila art to highlight and celebrate the rich culture of the region. “Every community has social issues. We should work on eliminating them together, not othering individuals for them,” she says. When Yadav returns to her village, she actively encourages marginalised communities like the Musahar to explore art and develop skills.In Janakpur, she has facilitated formal training sessions for numerous girls and women through her organisation, Mithila Hastakala Udyog. In Tarai, where many aspire to secure government jobs, Yadav advocates for broadening horizons. She believes that the younger generation should focus on acquiring skills and exploring entrepreneurship, particularly in Mithila handicrafts and art.The Madhesi community boasts a rich tradition of handicrafts utilising local materials and wool, alongside Mithila art. Yadav is convinced that with proper support from local government, the promotion of these crafts and cultural heritage could generate numerous job opportunities.Looking ahead, Yadav envisions a global expansion of Mithila art. She aims to bring together artists from diverse backgrounds, with a particular emphasis on highlighting marginalised communities, widowed and single women, and mothers. “My goal is to create job opportunities for them through Mithila culture and art, transcending beyond mere paintings,” she says.Yadav’s message to aspiring artists is clear: “Pursue the skills that interest you. If art is your passion, embrace it.” "

        "content": "The ongoing Nepal Investment Summit hopes to attract much-needed investment to the country. Taking part are over 1,700 potential investors from 55 countries. A total of 150 public and private projects are being showcased at the gathering. After two previous rather disappointing summits (in terms of realisation of pledged investments), we will have to wait a bit to see the outcome of this one. But there is one more promising avenue for Nepali economy. A week ago, Kathmandu hosted another vital gathering: The country’s first international LGBTIQ tourism conference. Whether or not Nepal can pull in big investments, it can certainly welcome more queer tourists and make big bucks: According to one estimate, the global spending power of the queer segment is around $4.7 trillion. Nepal is increasingly seen as a safe travel destination for LGBTIQ folks. This image has only been boosted by the successful marriage registration of Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung, the first same-sex couple to be legally recognised in Nepal, in November 2023. It was only the latest in a series of legal interventions recognising the rights of people of all genders and sexual orientations. As stakeholders have pointed out, ‘pink tourism’ will not just bring in foreign currency, it will also promote further inclusion and empowerment of the queer community. They will get good jobs too. Many such worthy initiatives are already underway. For instance, in order to cater to the tourists of the segment, the Nepal Tourism Board recently organised a trekking guide training for 25 individuals from the community. More queer-friendly businesses are opening up, and members of the community now head dozens of restaurants, travel agencies and hotels. All this makes Nepal easily the most LGBTIQ-friendly destination in South Asia. This is why it may be worthwhile for the country to explore multiple levels of engagement with the community, including in medical tourism. With no such facility available in Nepal, members of the Nepali transgender community are struggling to fund their gender affirmation surgeries abroad. If such surgeries could be arranged in Nepal, not only would it benefit the native transgender community but also attract other trans folks who want to undertake such procedures at a friendly location. It’s not just a matter of economics or the rights of the queer community either. With each progressive step of government agencies, NGOs and the private sector, Nepalis at large have also been forced to confront their prejudices and to widen their outlook on gender and sexuality. This opening up of our minds will further boost the country’s democratic culture. The prolonged economic slump has bred a kind of cynicism among us, which is also reflected in the over 1,500 people who are leaving the country to work and live abroad every single day. Yet in a world where parochialism has become the norm, Nepalis can be proud of the growing openness to new ideas and views, their homeland a welcome refuge for everyone. Nepal has the basics covered to welcome many more queer tourists. Now it is a matter of promoting the country right and building the facilities to cater to the community.      "

        "content": "For weeks now, the Nepali Congress (NC) has been demanding that Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane resign or be investigated by a parliamentary committee for his alleged involvement in embezzling funds from a cooperative, even as the government continues to defend him. On March 27, Basant Kunwar, the Inspector General of Nepal Police, said that a complaint regarding the matter had been logged, but their investigation yielded no evidence, falling outside the preview of the law (Onlinekhabar, March 27, 2024). The NC argued Kunwar’s comments could not be relied upon because he reports to the home ministry.The NC also rejected Lamichhane’s offer to address Parliament and answer their concerns. In response, Swarnim Wagle, a Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) lawmaker, challenged all political parties to support a \"grand public inquiry” into all corruption cases, including in the cooperatives. No wonder none of the major parties took his bait. They are all believed to have been parties to several major past corruption cases. Having failed to resolve the impasse, the Speaker on April 14 prorogued the winter session of Parliament. Obstruction of proceedingsHalting the parliament has become a routine in our political culture. When in opposition, the CPN-UML used obstruction as its primary tool to oppose the government. The party obstructed the house for eight months, between September 2021 and May 2022, because the Speaker refused their demand to revoke the membership of 14 lawmakers who had defected from the UML. In May last year, the UML obstructed the House protesting an allegation by a lawmaker that the party chair, KP Sharma Oli, was involved in a corruption scandal. The NC is in the business now just because the government didn’t concede to their demand. Sharp disagreements between the government and the opposition are common in every democracy. Take the schism between the Republicans and the Democrats in the United States Congress. Despite the differences, the parties let the process work. In extreme cases, the opposition may walk out of Congress for a short period, but blocking the proceedings and suspending the House for an extended period is unheard of. Lamichhanne’s financial past is known to be murky and questionable. IGP Kunwar’s comments notwithstanding, a recent report from the Nepal Police’s Rupandehi District Office implicated Lamichhane in a scandal of unpaid loan from the Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative in Butwal. It is within the NC’s rights to ask for an investigation into Lamichhane’s dealings. However, there are other options to force the investigation than obstructing Parliament. Since Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal brought Lamichhane to the cabinet, it would have been more sensible for the NC to go after Dahal than Lamichhane. The concern with conflict of interest could be addressed by requiring Lamichanne to recuse himself from the investigation and by ensuring his separation from the investigation is diligently followed. Parliamentary debates are key to the legislative process. To ensure that the debates happen without fear of prosecution, every MP is endowed with the privilege of freedom of speech, which guarantees his/her complete immunity from prosecution or civil liability for any comment he/she makes in Parliament. Considering this, obstructions by the NC and the UML are profoundly unparliamentary.Consequences The RSP came into existence because of the non-performance of the older parties and the widely held belief that politicians in old parties are involved in pervasive corruption. The party’s anti-corruption and efficient public service delivery agenda made it the fastest-growing political party in the country. All three major parties lost their votes in the last election, but the NC lost almost 11 percent, according to a long-time NC leader, Arjun Narshing KC. Most of the support for the RSP came from traditional NC voters.The newbie claims to have joined the government on the condition that it be allowed to work on its agenda without any interference. On March 13, Swarnim Wagle said his party would withdraw from the government if it failed to deliver. Lamichhane has already taken steps to resurrect some of the old corruption cases buried by the previous governments before a satisfactory conclusion. If these investigations continue, they will likely attract senior leaders of all three major parties. As the investigation proceeds, the prime minister will come under intense pressure from the UML and the NC leadership to intervene and terminate the investigation. If he does not intervene and the RSP delivers its agenda even partially, voters will see them as a better option than older parties. The non-intervention will be beneficial for the RSP. Even an intervention will work. If the prime minister intervenes, the RSP will accuse him of creating hurdles in its pursuit of corruption and leave the government. They will go to the next election with “anti-corruption investigations obstructed by the older parties” as their main slogan—a vote catcher for people fed up with political corruption! The RSP is in a win-win position as long as it does not waver from its present anti-corruption and service delivery agenda. Joining the government on the condition of delivering their agenda was a clever move by the RSP. Whether Dahal intervenes or not, it will work in RSP’s favour. The NC’s obstruction of Parliament and muzzling of Lamichhane is indefensible and will not get their votes back. The NC had already lost its image as a party anchored in democratic ideals and political integrity. By blocking Parliament, it has diminished further. "

        "content": "Many scientists and tech leaders have sounded the alarm about artificial intelligence in recent years, issuing dire warnings not heard since the advent of the nuclear age. Elon Musk, for example, has said that “AI is far more dangerous than nukes,” prompting him to ask an important question: “Why do we have no regulatory oversight? This is insane.”The late Stephen Hawking made a similar point: “Unless we learn how to prepare for and avoid the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilisation. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many.”Given the potentially catastrophic consequences of unchecked AI, there is a clear need for international guardrails to ensure that this emerging technology—more accurately called data-based systems—serves the common good. Specifically, that means guaranteeing that human rights are upheld globally, including online.To that end, governments should introduce regulations that promote data-based systems that seek to protect the powerless from the powerful by ensuring that human rights are respected, protected, implemented, and realised within such systems’ entire life cycle, including design, development, production, distribution, and use.Equally important, the United Nations must urgently establish an International Data-Based Systems Agency (IDA), a global AI watchdog that would promote safe, secure, sustainable, and peaceful uses of these technologies, ensure that they respect human rights and foster cooperation in the field. It would also have regulatory authority to help determine market approval for AI products. Given the similarities between data-based systems and nuclear technologies, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be the best model for such an institution, not least because it is one of the few UN agencies with “teeth.”The success of the IAEA has shown that we are capable of exercising caution and prohibiting the blind pursuit of technological advances when the future of humanity and the planet are at stake. After the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki revealed the devastating humanitarian consequences of nuclear war, research and development in the field of nuclear technology was curtailed to prevent even worse outcomes. This was made possible by an international regime – the IAEA – with strong enforcement mechanisms.A growing number of experts worldwide have called for establishing an IDA and supported the creation of data-based systems founded on respect for human rights. The Elders, an independent group of global leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, have recognised the enormous risks of AI and the need for an international agency like the IAEA “to manage these powerful technologies within robust safety protocols” and to ensure that they are “used in ways consistent with international law and human rights treaties.” Consequently, they encourage countries to submit a request to the UN General Assembly for the International Law Commission to draft an international treaty establishing a new AI safety agency.Among the influential supporters of a legally binding regulatory framework for AI is Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, whose public release of ChatGPT in late 2022 kicked off the AI arms race. Last year, Altman called for an international authority that can, among other things, “inspect systems, require audits, test for compliance with safety standards, [and] place restrictions on degrees of deployment and levels of security.” Even Pope Francis has emphasised the need to establish a multilateral institution that examines the ethical issues arising from AI and regulates its development and use by “a binding international treaty.”The UN, for its part, has highlighted the importance of promoting and protecting human rights in data-based systems. In July 2023, the Human Rights Council unanimously adopted a resolution on “New and emerging digital technologies and human rights,” which notes that these technologies “may lack adequate regulation” and stresses the need “for effective measures to prevent, mitigate, and remedy adverse human rights impacts of such technologies.” To that end, the resolution calls for establishing frameworks for impact assessments, exercising due diligence and ensuring effective remedies human oversight and legal accountability.More recently, in March, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on “Seizing the opportunities of safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems for sustainable development.” This landmark resolution recognises that “the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including throughout the lifecycle of artificial intelligence systems.”Now that the international community has recognised the imperative of protecting human rights in data-based systems, the next step is obvious. The UN must now translate this global consensus into action by establishing an IDA. "

        "content": "Suju Kali is a 50-year-old elephant in Nepal who has been carrying tourists for over 30 years. Like many elephants I encounter through my research, Suju Kali exhibits anxiety and can be aggressive toward strangers. She suffers from emotional trauma as a result of prolonged, commercial human contact.Like Suju Kali, many animals are trapped within the tourism industry. Some venues have no oversight and little concern for animal or tourist safety. Between 120,000 and 340,000 animals are used globally in a variety of wildlife tourism attractions, including endangered species like elephants. Over a quarter of the world’s endangered elephants reside in captivity with little oversight.Wildlife tourism—which involves viewing wildlife such as primates or birds in conservation areas, feeding or touching captive or “rehabilitated” wildlife in facilities, and bathing or riding animals like elephants—is tricky business. I know this because I am a researcher studying human relationships with elephants in both tourism and conservation settings within Southeast Asia.These types of experiences have long been an extremely popular and profitable part of the tourism market. But now, many travel-related organisations are urging people not to participate in, or calling for an outright ban on, interactive wildlife experiences.Tourism vendors have started marketing more “ethical options” for consumers. Some are attempting to truly improve the health and welfare of wildlife, and some are transitioning captive wildlife into touch-free, non-riding or lower-stress environments. In other places, organisations are attempting to implement standards of care or create manuals that outline good practices for animal husbandry.This marketing, academics argue, is often simply “greenwashing,” applying marketing labels to make consumers feel better about their choices without making any real changes. Worse, research shows that some programs marketing themselves as ethical tourism may instead be widening economic gaps and harming both humans and other species that they are meant to protect.No quick fixFor example, rather than tourist dollars trickling down to local struggling families as intended by local governments, many tourism venues are owned by nonresidents, meaning the profits do not stay in the area. Likewise, only a small number of residents can afford to own tourism venues, and venues do not provide employment for locals from lower income groups.This economic gap is especially obvious in Nepalese elephant stables: Venue owners continue to make money off elephants, while elephant caregivers continue to work 17 hours a day for about $21 a month; tourists are led to believe they are “promoting sustainability.”Yet, there are no easy answers, especially for elephants working in tourism. Moving them to sanctuaries is difficult because with no governmental or global welfare oversight, elephants may end up in worse conditions.Many kindhearted souls who want to “help” elephants know little about their biology and mental health needs, or what it takes to keep them healthy. Also, feeding large animals like Suju Kali is pricey, costing around $19,000 yearly. So without profits from riding or other income, owners—or would-be rescuers—can’t maintain elephants. Releasing captive elephants to the jungle is not a choice—many have never learned to live in the wild, so they cannot survive on their own.Hurting local peoplePart of the problem lies with governments, as many have marketed tourism as a way to fund conservation projects. For example in Nepal, a percentage of ticket sales from elephant rides are given to community groups to use for forest preservation and support for local families.Increasing demand for wildlife-based tourism may increase traffic in the area and thus put pressure on local governments to further limit local people’s access to forest resources.This may also lead to increased demands on local communities, as was the case in Nepal. In the 1970s, the Nepalese government removed local people from their lands in what is now Chitwan National Park as part of increasing “conservation efforts” and changed the protected area’s boundaries. Indigenous “Tharu,” or people of the forest, were forced to abandon their villages and land. While some were offered access to “buffer zones” in the 1990s, many remain poor and landless today.In addition, more and more desirable land surrounding conservation areas in Nepal is being developed for tourist-based businesses such as hotels, restaurants and shops, pushing local poor people farther away from central village areas and the associated tourism income.Some activists would like humans to simply release all wildlife back into the wild, but there are multiple issues with that. Elephant habitats throughout Southeast Asia have been transformed into croplands, cities or train tracks for human use. Other problems arise from the fact that tourism elephants have never learned how to be elephants in their natural elements, as they were separated from their herds at an early age.So tourism may be vital to providing food, care and shelter to captive elephants for the rest of their lives and providing jobs for those who really need them. Because elephants can live beyond 60 years, this can be a large commitment.Being ethicalTo protect elephants, tourists should check out reviews and photos from any venue they want to visit, and look for clues that animal welfare might be impacted, such as tourists allowed to feed, hold or ride captive wildlife animals. Look for healthy animals, which means doing research on what “healthy” animals of that species should look like.If a venue lists no-touch demonstrations—“unnatural” behaviours that don’t mimic what an elephant might do of their own accord, such as sitting on a ball or riding a bike, or other performances—remember that the behind-the-scenes training used to achieve these behaviours can be violent, traumatic or coercive.Another way to help people and elephant is to use small, local companies to book your adventures in your area of interest, rather than paying large, international tourism agencies. Look for locally owned hotels, and wait to book excursions until you arrive so you can use local service providers. Book homestay programmes and attend cultural events led by community members; talk to tourists and locals you meet in the target town to get their opinions, and use local guides who provide wildlife viewing opportunities while maintaining distance from animals.Or tourists can ask to visit venues that are certified by international humane animal organisations and that do not allow contact with wildlife. Or they can opt for guided hikes, canoe or kayak experiences, and other environmentally friendly options.While these suggestions will not guarantee that your excursion is animal-friendly, they will help decrease your impact on wildlife, support local families and encourage venues to stop using elephants as entertainment. Those are good first steps. "

        "content": "Pathetically endearing, Monty, the main character of ‘Ticket to Hollywood’ embodies a classical comedy protagonist. He is quirky, incompetent, persistent, and above all, likeable.Monty (played by Sudip Khatiwada), enters the stage, and the whole theatre erupts into laughter. Renowned in the Nepali film industry and nicknamed ‘Metaphor Monty’, he is quite the opposite of a metaphor—shallow and easy to see through. Despite being immensely successful in his country, Monty strives to work in Hollywood, his true dream. The play follows Monty and his journey toward obtaining his ticket to Hollywood, showcasing the hindrances that stand in his way as he strives to realise his dream.There are many obstacles for poor Monty: his chipped tooth, lack of a wisdom tooth, his deprived wife, a protest and his ambition, in some ways, is his biggest obstacle. If his ambition is the biggest obstacle, what is the real prize? The absurdity of the events happening to Monty perhaps represents, quite evidently, that it is leading up to something absurd—something that is the exact opposite of the outcome he envisions. Or perhaps, Monty is a mirror to the audience, representing the human need to strive towards something, juxtaposed with the worldly truth that there is something absurd about it all, something that feels cartoonish, yet discernible. This is why breaking the fourth wall feels like such a tasteful choice for the play. The actors communicate with the audience from the start, immediately transporting them into the world of the play. As the characters go about their circumstances, the audience interacts with the actors, enhancing the immersive experience, and inviting introspection.However, as the play progresses, its charisma declines. Some scenes feel overly farcical, while others seem out of place, unnecessary, or even overdone. Monty develops a split personality through his newly planted wisdom tooth, which guides him through his circumstances in his quest to obtain his ticket to Hollywood. But as the play comes to an end, the audience is left without any explanation of the intentions behind the wisdom tooth, either as a plot device within the play or as a stylistic choice outside of it. I speculated that perhaps the lack of explanation is a metaphor, but honestly, to me, this absence feels more like a plot hole than a deliberate choice.What saddens me is that this play, as a whole, holds incredible promise, and a few adjustments could have truly elevated it to exceptional heights. For instance, one of the most noticeable limitations is that the ‘moral lesson’ at the end of the play falls flat. There is a lot of buildup leading up to this moment, but despite its intention to be deep and evocative, it ultimately feels disappointing. Three sequences led to nowhere; these moments also felt boring and detracted from the earlier established charm of the play. At this point, much of the audience felt somewhat lost, whispering to each other about what certain elements might mean or how they fit into the narrative. I shared this experience, as I too began to feel lost, contemplating the potential significance of various elements. A crucial scene in the play captures thematic elements resonant with our society, portraying a protest initiated for a seemingly trivial reason. This scene demonstrates the susceptibility of the youth to drama, mirroring aspects of contemporary societal dynamics. This era of Nepali society is no stranger to silly antics for trivial reasons; after all, we are a generation shaped by ‘Nepal banda’. It is a little disappointing that such a crucial scene failed to effectively communicate its intended message. This scene was meant to tie everything together and highlight the sheer absurdity of Monty’s aspirations, potentially leading to a more satisfying conclusion.However, it fell short, relying too heavily on physical comedy and leaving the audience with too little to grasp in terms of understanding the intended moral lesson.It is not too difficult to infer that perhaps the intended moral lesson was about embracing our own identity and investing in our own industry. However, due to the excessive and unintelligent buildup, this grand lesson failed to resonate effectively with the audience.Despite its narrative shortcomings, it’s important to acknowledge the exceptional musical elements that enriched the experience of ‘Ticket to Hollywood’. Anup Timilsina, the play’s music director, elevated the production by adding depth, vibrancy, and a sense of fun to the overall performance. The hook song ‘Ticket to Hollywood’ has been stuck in my mind for three days now; it is infectiously catchy. Having more musical elements would have made the play a more entertaining watch.Besides the music, Milan Karki’s portrayal of Monty’s assistant is incredibly entertaining. His stage presence and charisma are truly undeniable. The outfits, particularly those of the two main characters and Monty’s wife, are also impressive. Had the actor portraying Monty’s wife in drag worn makeup, it would have elevated the overall look.‘Ticket to Hollywood’ is hilarious, whimsical and amusing. It provides an antidote to Monty’s ambition by offering him closure that encourages embracing tradition. But do absurd ambitions require stringent antidotes? Or is ambition itself the antidote to the absurd abyss of human life? Guess you’ll need to watch the play to find out.Ticket to HollywoodDirector: Sagar Khati KamiCast: Sudip Khatiwada, Milan Karki, Santosh Giri, Diggaj Khatri, Anup TimilsinaLanguage: NepaliDuration: 1 hour 18 minutes‘Ticket to Hollywood’ will be shown at Mandala Theatre in Thapagaun, New Baneshwar, Kathmandu, until May 5.

        "content": "Politicians on either side of the isle tried to assure potential investors with one voice on Sunday of the safety and return on their investments in Nepal as the government kicked off a two-day Investment Summit.Leader of the main opposition Nepali Congress, Sher Bahadur Deuba, supported Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's statement before foreign delegates that Nepal is an investment-friendly country.Speaking at the opening session of the third Investment Summit in Kathmandu on Sunday, Prime Minister Dahal, who chairs the CPN (Maoist Centre), and Congress President Deuba tried to send a message across that the country’s political instability won’t impact their investments. Political instability is often blamed for the lack of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Nepal but the leaders stressed that policy stability ensures a suitable investment climate.During his speech at the summit, Nepal's prime minister, who adheres to a communist ideology, reassured investors of the government's liberal investment policies. This was a considerate move on the part of the prime minister for Rameshore Khanal, a former finance secretary.“Not only the prime minister and the opposition leader, but leaders of major parties who spoke at the event also vowed to maintain continuity of policy despite changes in the government,” Khanal told the Post. “An unstable political situation is often denounced when it comes to the lack of foreign investment in our country, but leaders have tried to reassure the investors of the continuity of the policy despite the changes in government.”Leaders, ranging from the ruling coalition to the opposition party, who spoke on the occasion assured of policy continuity and urged investors to invest in Nepal. “The leaders tried to assure investors that they won’t face any economic backlash should they invest in Nepal,” Khanal said.The Congress-Maoist Centre alliance governed the country until March 4, before Maoist Centre chair Dahal ditched the Congress and took UML on board. The third Nepal Investment Summit, announced by the Congress-Maoist government in November last year, was continued by the UML-Maoist Centre government. Addressing the inaugural session of the summit, Congress President Deuba also said that all major parties of Nepal are committed to uniting to promote foreign investment and have consensus on major investment issues of the country.Deuba presented Nepal as a country with a great potential for development but also acknowledged that it lacks sufficient capital and appropriate technology to achieve the benefits of development. Reiterating Nepal as an attractive investment destination, Deuba appealed to foreigners to invest here.“Nepal is willing to enter into bilateral investment protection agreements with various countries to promote Nepal as an attractive investment destination,” Deuba said.“International and domestic investors can leave a transformative impact on major sectors such as agriculture, tourism, infrastructure development, mining and minerals, hydropower and information technology.”Prime Minister Dahal stressed that Nepal is a suitable destination for investment and called upon investors to take advantage of this opportunity. Expressing his government’s commitment to liberal policies, he spoke of efforts made to build an investment-friendly climate. The prime minister said that Nepal was moving steadily towards creating a friendly environment for investors, industrialists, and entrepreneurs. As part of the effort, eight laws related to business and investment have been amended. The government revised some crucial laws related to investment through an ordinance. President Ramchandra Paudel on Sunday issued the ordinance amending some Nepal acts related to investment facilitation. The President issued the ordinance on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers in accordance with Article 114 (1) of the Constitution of Nepal.A day before the third Nepal Investment Summit, the main opposition Congress had expressed its serious reservations over the government’s approach to amending important laws through ordinance. However, the Congress reservation over the ordinance did not reflect in the summit hall. The remarks made by Congress leader Deuba and Prakash Sharan Mahat, who was the finance minister when the summit was announced, also suggest that.Internally, the political parties of Nepal might have differing opinions on various things, but the diversity of political views won’t affect foreign investments in Nepal, Mahat said.Yubaraj Khatiwada, another former finance minister and UML leader, and Swarnim Wagle, vice-chair of Rastriya Swatantra Party and an economist, also expressed views supportive of investments.Before this, Nepal had hosted two Investment Summits back in 2017 and 2019.

        "content": "Nepal on Saturday hosted the first international LGBTIQ tourism conference. It wants a chunk of the multi-billion dollar pink market after the stunning success of a legally recognised same-sex marriage last November.“Forget Nepal’s biased history. Now, we aim at building more just and equitable societies. Let the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex or queer (LGBTIQ) get equal economic opportunity,” said Sunil Babu Pant, the first openly gay former parliamentarian in Asia, addressing the conference in Kathmandu.Just a few years back, police beating gay and transgender individuals in the streets used to be a common sight.“After fighting legal battles for nearly two decades, the law and the society have accepted the LGBTIQ community. Now we are in the second phase—we need equal economic opportunities. For this we need to bring LGBTIQ tourists from the global market.”The conference was announced following the successful marriage registration of Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung, the first same-sex couple to get legally recognised in Nepal, on November 29, 2023, after a years-long legal wrangling.This interim arrangement remains valid until the legal provisions are made.Their legally recognised same-sex marriage is the first of its kind in South Asia and marks a milestone for LGBTIQ rights.“It is a privilege to stand before you and reflect on a pivotal moment in my career, one that underscores the importance of justice, equality, and the pursuit of human rights,” said Supreme Court Justice Hari Prasad Phuyal, who in 2007 as a lawyer argued in favour of laws guaranteeing full rights of LGBTIQ people and in defining gender minorities as “natural persons” under the law. They had the right to marry, he argued. Eventually, in December 2007, the court issued a historic verdict ensuring the rights of the community.The verdict reads: “No one has the right to question how two adults perform sexual intercourse and whether this intercourse is natural or unnatural and that … the way the right to privacy is secured to two heterosexual individuals in sexual intercourse, it is equally secured to the people of third gender who have a different gender identity and sexual orientation.” “In 2007, I found myself entrusted with a case… by Sunil Babu Pant that would leave an indelible mark on my journey. At the helm of Blue Diamond Society, Sunil brought forth a case that demanded not just representation, but a profound understanding of the struggle faced by the LGBTIQ community,” said Phuyal.“Admittedly, my initial knowledge was limited on the issue, but through dedicated learning and unwavering commitment, I found the confidence to evoke it, and here we have it. The outcome, a resounding decision of the Supreme Court, stands as a backbone of hope and progress not only for Nepal but the world at large.“We recognise that the civil and political rights are fundamental, but so are economic, social and cultural rights.”He said that “rainbow tourism” not only promises economic growth but presents an opportunity to foster inclusion and empowerment in the LGBTIQ community. “By integrating them into the national economy, we not only create employment opportunities but also contribute to the overall prosperity of our nation.”He stressed that the decision made by Nepal’s Supreme Court is a precedent for other countries, including the neighbours. Diane Anderson-Minshall, CEO and chief storyteller of GO Magazine, in her presentation titled ‘LGBTI Tourism Global Overview and its Contribution to the Economy’, said that LGBTIQ or pink tourism are the segments of travellers that have a lot of wealth and purchasing power. According to her, based on the Wealth and Travel Data Report of LGBT Capital 2023, the global annual spending power of LGBTIQ consumers is $4.7 trillion. Among them, the Americans have a spending capacity of $1.4 trillion, followed by the Chinese at $872 billion, Germans at $224 billion, Indians at $168 billion and the British at $164 billion. China is an untapped market and that’s going to grow over the next several years. “And one of the things that we know from Chinese gay travellers is they are looking for places they feel safe, where they can hold hands and where they can have new experiences.”And those are things they'll find in Nepal, said Anderson-Minshall. Germany and the UK are the LGBTIQ capitals. Nandini Lahe-Thapa, director of the Nepal Tourism Board, said, “For Nepal’s tourism industry, the LGBTIQ conference is a triumph as this is one of the most important market segments that we have yet to tap.”To attract more tourists to spend more and stay longer, Nepal is following the principle of ‘tourism for all and the power for all seasons and all reasons’, said Lahe-Thapa. “And so we are very proud to partner with the first-ever Rainbow Tourism International Conferences.”People choose to travel to places where they feel safe, respected and can be themselves.“People might feel uncomfortable sharing their identity and choices if the place and the people are judgmental and unfriendly. Here we have an advantage as a destination,” said Lahe-Thapa.Nepal Tourism Board and the travel trade fraternity plan to capitalise on the potential of the pink community worldwide and have started investing in creating a more friendly and enabled environment to foster such tourism. Last year, the board organised a trekking guide training for 25 individuals from the LGBTIQ community.According to Pant, now there are several businesses owned by members of the LGBTIQ communities—with at least two dozen bars, restaurants, travel and tour operators and hotels in Kathmandu. “Businesses are opening up for the queer and that’s a good sign. We can promote Nepal as a same-sex marriage and honeymoon destination.”Nepal’s diverse culture includes rich LGBTIQ-related traditions. Exploring the country’s festivals, temples, symbols, rituals and stories, such as the concept of Ajima and the recognition of six genders, offers a unique cultural experience.Pant said that they have launched a ‘tantra heritage tour’ that provides an in-depth exploration of Nepal's culture and spiritual aspects, including those related to matriarchy and LGBTIQ communities.The pink community worldwide opens up a new segment of valuable visitors for Nepal.Veronique Lorenzo, the EU ambassador to Nepal, said, “For Nepal, this is the first of many happy journeys. I think this conference can play an important role in supporting Nepal’s economy and helping the LGBTIQ community with jobs and recognition. There's an array of benefits from this tourism segment.”“Nepal is a success story. It's the second country in Asia to have have registered same-sex marriage. Of course, there's still a lot of progress to be made. The fight has to go on every day to bring the legislative and legal frameworks in line with the evolution of society.”“It's not just about the pink money, it's also about promoting inclusiveness and being fair to travellers.”  "

        "content": "Remittance-dependent Nepal may face a dizzying sequence of shocks, particularly in the labour market, due to escalating tensions in the Middle East following Iran's attack on Israel on Saturday, experts have warned.Reports show that Tehran has warned it will strike again with greater force if Israel or the US retaliates for the Iranian strike on Israel. The Iranian attack, which involved more than 300 drones and missiles, were carried out on Saturday night. In India, several leading airlines have cancelled flights to Iran and restricted their use of Israeli and Iranian airspace amid rapidly escalating tensions. This has spurred worries for Nepal, which is mostly dependent on remittance earnings that make for a substantial portion of its economy.Most rural households now depend on at least one member's earnings from employment abroad. Due to remittances, according to the latest living standard survey, the average annual spending on consumption rose by 66 percent in the past 12 years, reaching Rs126,172 in 2023 from Rs75,902 in 2011.According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, the remittance inflow stood at $9.33 billion in the last fiscal year, the record-high earnings that have taken the country’s foreign exchange reserve to a historic high. In the last fiscal year, 774,976 Nepali left the country for foreign jobs. According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank, Qatar is the top source market for Nepal, hosting 133,262 workers in the last fiscal year, followed by the UAE (116,160), Saudi Arabia (112,777), Kuwait (43,508), Oman (5,294), Bahrain (7,690) and Jordan (1,019).Israel hosted 1,084 Nepali workers in the last fiscal year. Experts say that a crisis in the Middle East, which employs nearly half of the migrant workers from Nepal, will potentially hit Nepal and suggest preparing strategies to absorb the emerging geopolitical shocks. “Tensions in the Middle East are not a good sign for a country like Nepal whose income largely depends on remittances,” said Ganesh Gurung, a migration expert. Besides, say economists, conflict in the key oil-producing countries pushes up inflation.The Asian Development Bank said in its recent report that any intensified geopolitical turmoil could disrupt supply chains, increasing global inflation and tightening financial conditions worldwide. This may lead to tightening of domestic monetary policy, which will undermine investment and consumption and may drag down growth for the ailing Nepali economy. “As we see, 1,200 to 1,500 Nepalis are leaving daily for Gulf countries for jobs. The conflict will stop many Nepalis from going to such countries. If these countries stopped hiring workers, the number of unemployed will rise,” said Gurung. “Greater unemployment at home could bring social disturbances.” Experts say the decline in remittances will reduce Nepal’s foreign currency reserves, which may cause severe stress on the economy as domestic production has stagnated.“The government needs to start preparing to absorb the potential shock,” said Gurung. Some countries are already working out strategies to avoid potential economic impact.On Sunday, the South Korean government announced heightened vigilance against potential domestic repercussions in light of the escalated tensions in the Middle East following Iran's attack on Israel, according to media reports.Also on Sunday, the Embassy of Nepal in Tel Aviv, Israel issued a notice requesting Nepalis to follow the local protocol directed by the Israeli Home Front Command. Nepal’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it is closely following the development in West Asia. “We are seriously concerned at the rising tensions and escalation of hostilities in the region. The government of Nepal firmly believes in a peaceful resolution of disputes and deplores the use of force. We call on all the parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint and use dialogue and diplomacy to restore peace,” the embassy statement said.Oil prices have also started going up.On Sunday, the Brent crude oil price reached $90.21 per barrel. Oil rose 1 percent on Friday on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.Last week, oil prices neared a six-month high on concerns that Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), might retaliate for a suspected Israeli warplane attack on Iran’s embassy in Damascus last Monday, according to the reports.The conflict’s impact on global oil markets is significant, as any risk of supply disruptions could lead to a price hike. Nepal is still bearing the cost of high oil prices which has pushed up inflation.Rising conflict has become a major concern for the disruption in the supply chain as Iran has threatened to shut down the Suez Canal. The disruption of shipping routes in the Red Sea will result in higher shipping costs, according to media reports.The World Bank said in its recent report that the cost of shipping from Asia to Europe has jumped to over US$3,000 for a 40-foot container, a threefold increase over the lowest rate in 2023 (about US$1,000).“The rise in tensions in the Middle East means trade disturbances globally,” said Chandramani Adhikari, an economist. “For Nepal, most of whose remittance comes from the Middle Eastern nations, it could spell disaster.”The government is happy with the improvements in external sectors which is mostly due to the boost in remittance. “But as soon as the labour markets get hit, there will be a direct impact on the country’s income,” said Adhikari. “People who are working in the conflict-hit countries might experience reduced savings due to the rise in the cost of living in the destination countries,” Adhikari said. “The rise in tensions will have an impact on the tourist arrivals as countries will issue travel advisories,” Adhikari said. “More polarisation among powerful economies, as they spend more on war, will also affect the foreign aid being provided to Nepal, besides foreign investment,” Adhikari said.The international conflict also has the potential to strengthen the dollar. The rise in oil prices and dollar rate will affect Nepal’s economy side-by-side as it impacts consumption and increases inflation, Adhikari said. “So, all these phenomena will hit Nepal’s economy.” "

        "content": "On August 2, 2022, a 26-year-old woman from Baneshwar in Kathmandu filed an FIR against her husband for subjecting her to a series of sexual violence immediately after their marriage. The victim stated that the husband forced her into sexual acts repeatedly against her wish. The series started nine days after their wedding, the statement charged.This was one of the 2,387 marital rape cases filed in Nepal that year. As of mid-March, 2023, the number of complaints stood at 1,567. The issue made headlines earlier this month when Ravi Oad, winner of the second season of the reality TV show Nepal Idol, was accused of marital rape with a complaint filed against him at the Kanchanpur Area Police Office in Jhalari. A day before the case against Oad was filed, the Supreme Court had ordered the detention of judge Bhuwan Giri, who is accused of marital rape, revoking the High Court decision to release him on bail.Marital rape law in Nepal has undergone several amendments, with jail terms and sentences extended over the years. “If the husband commits rape on his wife during the existence of marital relationship between them,” the Section 219 (4) of National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 states, “he shall be liable to a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.” As opposed to previous laws regarding marital rape in the country—especially after the Supreme Court in 2006 declared marital rape a crime punishable by 3-6 months of jail term—the current law seems to acknowledge the severity of the crime. But increased jail term hasn’t ensured justice for the victims, experts say.In Nepal and its neighbours, rape laws and marital rape laws are two separate codes. While the maximum jail term for rape in Nepal can exceed 10 years, the maximum sentence for marital rape is no more than five years.Despite amendments to marital rape law in the country, there is a loophole in its implementation and that has been depriving victims of total and true justice, says Meera Dhungana, senior legal adviser at the Forum for Women, Law, and Development, an NGO working for women’s rights.Dhungana blames vague wording of Section 219 of the Penal Code for leaving loopholes in the law’s implementation. According to Dhungana, due to the ‘up to 5 years’ provision of the code, the convict can face jail term anywhere from a few months to years, as the wording doesn’t set a mandatory term.Nepal’s Supreme Court acknowledged the existence of marital rape in 2002 when it passed a judgment on a petition filed by the forum. Following a lengthy Public Interest Litigation (PIL), which demanded equality to victims of marital rape on the grounds that nonconsensual intercourse is rape even though it’s between spouses, the court acknowledged the existence of marital rape.However, the judgement didn’t specify any punishment or jail term. It was only in 2006 that a jail term of 3 to 6 months was declared for those convicted of marital rape.This wasn't enough. A jail term of mere months did little to prevent a second-time offence, Dhungana says. “Victims told us how their spouses had returned and begun their abuse once again,” she says.After the Constitution of Nepal came into effect in 2015, the landmark Act to Amend Laws to End Gender Violence and Ensure Gender Equality increased the jail term for marital rape, from a minimum of 3 years up to 5 years.However, the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017, changed things yet again as it left the minimum sentence for marital rape convicts unspecified. Now convicted could get away with a jail term of a few months.“This is a glaring loophole,” Dhungana says. “It's very difficult for the convicted to get more than six months of jail term. The separation of rape and marital rape means those suffering violence from marital rape barely get justice, which shouldn’t be the case. Home is the place where you go to feel safe, and when violence occurs at home, the severity and mental and physical toll can be so much worse.”The murky laws surrounding marital rape have their roots in social stigma. With the ‘reputation’ of families on the line, women who do file complaints are often compelled to back down.“A lot of the victims end up withdrawing their statements and FIR due to familial pressure,” Dhungana says, adding that this often leads to out-of-court settlements.Victims of marital rape face profound mental and psychological challenges after being abused at their own home, and the subsequent pressure to remain quiet about it. Research has shown marital rape to be associated with clinical depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and, in extreme cases, suicidality.Despite the gravitas of the subsequent mental health problems, seeking psychological treatment for their trauma isn’t nearly as common among victims. Rupa Pradhan Chhetri, a trauma counsellor who has been treating victims of sexual assault for over 12 years now, says she has never encountered a victim seeking help for marital rape.“I think a major reason for this is lack of awareness of marital rape itself, as well as societal pressure,” Chhetri says. “A large section of our society doesn’t acknowledge marital rape as an issue, which means most victims aren’t even aware of the assault they may have suffered. It’s no wonder then that seeking help isn’t common among the victims.”Women’s rights activists say they have observed general lack of awareness among victims on several occasions. Sulochana Khanal, programme coordinator at Women’s Rehabilitation Centre (WOREC), says that during counselling sessions a large number of women seeking help for domestic violence often reveal details of spousal sexual abuse without realising it as such.“We’ve handled cases and counselled survivors who specifically seek help for marital rape. But what’s also saddening is the number of women who do not realise the sexual violence and coercion they’ve been subjected to,” Khanal says. “We’d be counselling women on domestic abuse, and through these sessions, we hear stories that they have also been sexually exploited by their spouses.”Advocate Sarita Pokhrel also states that many of the victims she has worked with have sought legal help only after years of spousal abuse.“I think when it comes to marital rape, you rarely hear it occur as a one-time incident,” Pokhrel says. “It's often accompanied by years of spousal violence before the victims report it.”Pokhrel also says that the victims she’s worked with rarely feel the sentences their spouses have been handed down to be enough. “Justice may be dealt with legally, but for the victims, it's not what they hoped for,” Pokhrel says.

        "content": "Monarchists would have us believe that the restoration of the throne is the panacea to Nepal's troubles. They argue that the monarch, in this case, the former king Gyanendra Shah, will reign in venal politicians, stand for national unity, protect Nepal’s sovereignty, and spearhead economic development. Judging by the increasing size of Shah's followers, it appears that people are listening. Until a few years ago, the monarchists consisted of conservatives and direct beneficiaries of the authoritarian monarchy of the past. Now, people with no political affiliation throng every public event attended by the former king. Among major political parties, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) is the only one that fully supports the idea of restoring the monarchy, although there is a growing ambivalence among the rank and file of other national parties. The RPP rose from the fringes to become the fifth-largest national party by winning 14 parliamentary seats in the 2022 elections, a victory for their twin ideologies of constitutional monarchy and Hindu nationalism. The number of votes it secured rose from 196,782 in the 2017 elections to 588,849 in 2022. Public rallies of the RPP and other pro-monarchy forces continue to grow. Why is the support for the monarchy growing despite opposition from major political parties, and what can we realistically expect if, indeed, the monarchy returns? What does the history of countries where monarchy was restored tell us?Growing popularity Several factors, including abuse of political power by the leaders of all three major political parties, pervasive corruption, deteriorating public service, and a sense of despondency have compelled the people to look for a stark alternative to the current political structure. They see that alternative in the monarchy. If the political parties had delivered what they promised 16 years ago, when Shah abdicated the throne, no one would have thought of his return now. The RPP and the Hindutva movement in India are actively contributing to the prospect of monarchy as an alternative force. India’s ruling Hindu nationalist party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), wants to spread Hindutva to Nepal. RPP’s agenda of Hindu nationalism and “Hindu Rashtra” aligns with the Hindutva movement. The alignment has inspired stealthy cooperation between the BJP and the RPP. BJP spokesperson Bizay Sonkar Shastri had in 2021 said that Nepal “was, is and will always remain a Hindu nation”. Professor S.D Muni, a well-known Indian Scholar in Nepal, was quoted by the Diplomat, claiming that “Hindu Nationalism has become Modi’s government's main agenda in Nepal\". When Shah visits India for “pilgrimage”, he is treated as royalty, particularly by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindutva nationalist and a close Modi associate. In 2015, when he was a parliamentarian, Adityanath wrote to the Prime Minister of Nepal: “Nepal must be a Hindu State”. The US State Department’s “International Religious Freedom Report” of 2023 noted that “right-wing religious groups associated with the BJP have been providing funds to influential politicians of all parties in Nepal so that they speak in favour of Hindu Statehood”. It further said, “The Civil Society leaders in Nepal claim influence from the BJP and other Hindu groups in India continue to pressure politicians in Nepal, particularly the RPP, to support Hindu State”. The RPP has rejected this claim. History's lessonsRestoring monarchy is not a new idea, as it has happened many times in the past. Absolute monarchy was the preferred government structure worldwide until a few centuries ago. But most of these monarchies don't exist anymore. Europe's history, since the 1700s, is littered with the cycle of overthrown, restored and repeatedly overthrown monarchies. The King of England went into exile in 1649 after his army was defeated in a civil war. The country was ruled as 'The Commonwealth' until the monarchy was restored in 1660. It has lasted to date. The French monarchy was abolished in 1792 and returned several times in various guises, only to be thrown out repeatedly. It is now completely abolished. The Greek monarchy, created by the London Conference in 1832, was overthrown in 1924 and restored in 1935. It was abolished again in 1973 and is gone forever. Spain also had a round of overthrows and restorations—the last restoration, which occurred in 1978, has lasted to date. The record of Asian and African monarchies is not dissimilar to that of Europe. A military coup overthrew Afganistan's monarchy in 1973. When Zahir Shah returned 49 years later, the Afghans wanted to put him back on the throne, but that did not work. Afghanistan's monarchy was never restored. Palden Thondup Namal, Chogyal (King) of Sikkim, lost his throne to India in 1975. No one talks about the Iranian monarchy anymore. Africa, too, had many monarchies or some equivalent authority. There are now only three monarchies in Africa, two of which are constitutional. History informs us that monarchies have been overthrown and restored. Monarchies that fail to meet people's exceptions get dumped. Only constitutional monarchies, which act within the bounds of the constitution, survive, including in England, Spain, Norway, Sweden and Thailand.It is fairly common for people who have lost hope in the existing system to want to return to the old order, like the restoration of monarchy. When the restored monarchy fails to perform, which most do, they, too, get booted. Eventually, after the cycle of overthrow and restoration is exhausted, despite all its problems, people seem to settle for democratic republics. FinallyShould the monarchy be restored in Nepal, sustaining it will be challenging. No one will argue that its restoration would be possible without India's support. To survive, the monarchy will have to be accepted as the guardian of our sovereignty and an able manager of corrupt politicians. The monarchy, propped by India, will not have the strength to reject India's overtures, which often infringe on our sovereignty. Also, since the current popularity of our monarchy is more by default—being considered because politicians have failed to deliver, not because people love it—than inherent, if, after restoration, it fails to meet people's expectations, it will, like other restored monarchies, not survive. A constitutional monarchy with no executive power is unlikely to be able to meet those expectations. The absolute monarchy will have the executive power, but we have experimented with it, and it failed. The monarchists' idea that the return of constitutional monarchy will solve Nepal’s problems is nostalgic, amnesiac, and ahistoric. "

However, forming new ruling coalitions has been more difficult than dismantling the existing ones, as the struggles of the newly appointed chief ministers show.The chief minister of Lumbini Province has split a ministry and increased the number of ministries to 11 from the existing 10 to address demands of ruling parties for ministerial berths. The Jokh Bahadur Mahara-led government made the decision from a Cabinet meeting of the Lumbini Province on Wednesday.Coalition partners had been demanding more ministries as government formation took shape. Chief Minister Mahara decided to split the ministry after coalition partner CPN (Unified Socialist) threatened to quit the government should their party not be given any ministerial position. Earlier, the Unified Socialist was not allocated any ministerial position during power-sharing upon the government’s formation.But the Lumbini chief minister claimed that the decision to increase the number of ministries was not due to Unified Socialist’s threat. “We had decided to increase the number of ministries to 11 from the existing 10 right at the time of planning the coalition, which we implemented today,” Mahara said.He said that the additional ministry was within the constitutional limit in view of the 87-strong Lumbini provincial assembly. “We have abided by the constitutional provision while increasing the number of ministries,” Mahara told the Post over the phone.Article 168 (9) of the constitution says that the Province Head, on the chief minister’s recommendation, constitutes the provincial Council of Ministers consisting of a maximum 20 percent of the total members of the Provincial Assembly, including the chief minister, in accordance with the inclusive principle.The Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens is a new addition in the province. Earlier the domain was under the Ministry of Education, Youth, Sports and Culture. The new ministry will be led by the Unified Socialist.Mahara took the decision after three weeks of wrangling over power-sharing following his appointment on April 5.It is not only Mahara who struggles to give full shape to the provincial Cabinet. Almost each province has its own set of challenges. They are in the initial stage of government forming or in constituting the Cabinet after the chief minister is appointed.In Sudurpaschim and Gandaki provinces, government formation faces court cases filed by opposition parties objecting to the chief minister appointment process. Dirgha Bahadur Sodari of the Unified Socialist was appointed the chief minister of Sudurpaschim Province with the backing of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) on April 18. But he has not been able to expand his Cabinet.On the same day of his appointment, Chief Minister Sodari administered the oath to Kailash Chaudhary, the provincial leader of Nagarik Unmukti Party (NUP), as the minister for physical infrastructure and development. Chaudhary, who was vying for the post of Sudurpaschim chief minister, from the Ranjita Shrestha faction, later ended up becoming the minister for physical infrastructure.Although the UML supported Sodari as the chief minister of the province, the UML parliamentary party in Sudurpaschim has decided not to join the Sodari Cabinet immediately. Not only the UML, the Maoist Centre has also yet to name its ministers for the Sodari Cabinet. However, Minister Chaudhary believes the Cabinet will get its full shape soon.“So far, we two are the only Cabinet members as the UML and the Maoist Centre have decided to send their ministers together [later],” Chaudhary told the Post over the phone. “We hope the Cabinet will get full shape shortly.” Yamlal Kandel, provincial parliamentary leader of the UML, was appointed the chief minister of Karnali Province on April 9. But for two weeks, Kandel has been unable to expand his Cabinet. Prolonged negotiations between UML and Maoist leaders at the centre allegedly delayed the Cabinet expansion in Karnali. But, with the agreement on Wednesday to give four vital ministerial portfolios to the Maoist Centre, the two parties decided to appoint more ministers. With the agreement, Ranasingh Pariyar, the chief whip of the Maoist Centre in Karnali Province, is sworn in as a minister without portfolio. Though the two parties agreed on power-sharing, the Karnali government remains incomplete. The Cabinet is expected to get a full shape only after Chief Minister Kandel wins the trust vote onThursday, according to an official at the secretariat of Chief Ministry Kandel.“Today Ranasingh Pariyar took the oath of a minister without portfolio, the expansion of the Cabinet and ministerial portfolios will be decided after the government wins the assembly’s trust, the official said.In the power-sharing deal, the Maoist Centre, the second-largest party with 13 seats in the assembly, agreed to back Kandel of the UML, which has 10 seats, as the chief minister.Last week, Kandel visited Kathmandu and held meetings with UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Prime Minister and Maoist Centre chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal on removing the hurdles to Cabinet formation.Bagmati Chief Minister Shalikram Jamkattel, who won the trust vote on April 1, has still not been able to settle inter-party disputes on ministerial allocations.The Unified Socialist holds three ministries including the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Transport and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. “Our party is demanding a restructuring of the ministries according to the agreement reached while forming the government on April 1,” Krishna Khanal, a Bagmati assembly member from the Unified Socialist, told the Post. “With the restructuring, we want every party to hold the ministries with equal weight.” In Koshi, the government formation process has failed to move ahead smoothly as Chief Minister Kedar Karki has refused to quit despite changes in the coalition at the centre. The Karki government has been reduced to a minority after the UML-Maoist Centre withdrew their support after the change in coalition partner at Kathmandu on March 4. The two opposition parties in Koshi, however, have asked Chief Minister Karki either to prove his majority in the assembly or resign, which Karki has been defying. In Gandaki, Khagaraj Adhikari of the UML was appointed the chief minister on April 7. But the Congress immediately challenged his appointment as Speaker Krishna Prasad Dhital was also listed among the assembly members who supported his bid. Surendra Pandey, the Nepali Congress leader in Gandaki Province, filed a petition in the Supreme Court on April 9 arguing that Adhikari’s appointment was unconstitutional as the Speaker was counted among the supporters to muster a majority in Adhikari’s favour. The Supreme Court has taken up the case concerning Gandaki politics. "

        "content": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the District Police Office and the District Attorney’s Office in Rautahat to furnish written clarifications for not investigating an incident of mass killing in the district.Responding to a writ petition by advocate Tribhuvan Sah, a single bench of Justice Til Prasad Shrestha demanded justification from the two government units for not commencing an investigation into the 17-year-old massacre. They have 15 days to respond to the show-cause order from the top court.Sah had moved the top court demanding its intervention with no initiative to probe the killing. On March 21, 2007, as many as 27 individuals associated with the then CPN (Maoist) were brutally killed, with another 115 injured in the incident. Then Madheshi Janadhikar Forum Nepal led by Upendra Yadav, now chair of the Janata Samajbadi Party and deputy prime minister and minister for health and population, was involved in the killing. The National Human Rights Commission has implicated Yadav and 129 others in connection with the crime.After a years-long investigation, the commission on January 7 last year had asked government agencies through the Prime Minister’s Office to probe the incident and take action against Yadav and others in connection with the crime. In its recommendations, the commission had asked the government to proceed with the investigation of the complaint lodged at the district police on May 11, 2007, and report to it on the progress made, every three months. It also suggested providing Rs300,000 to each victim’s family while also offering free treatment to the injured and seeking details of all that was lost in the incident.However, the government hasn’t acted on its recommendation yet. As per the commission Act, the government either has to abide by its recommendations or write back to the rights watchdog within three months, explaining why its recommendations cannot be implemented.Over a year since the commission’s decision, the government has neither abided by it nor explained to the commission why its recommendation wasn’t implemented. “In his response to the commission, Yadav said his attention was drawn to the matter and he respects human rights issues,” Shyam Babu Kafle, the investigation chief at the commission, told the Post. “However, the government has neither commenced any investigation nor given reasons why it hasn’t been done.”The constitutional rights commission had concluded that the killings of more than two dozen people were orchestrated and that both the then Madheshi Janadhikar Forum-Nepal and the CPN (Maoist) had indications of possible violence when they chose the same venue for their rallies.Concluding its investigation 17 years after the incident, the commission had also directed the government to take departmental actions against then-Rautahat district police chief Yogeshwar Romkhami; then-chief district officer Madhav Prasad Ojha; Superintendent of Police Ram Kumar Khanal; deputy superintendent of Armed Police Force Dharmananda Sapkota; and sub-inspector Kamakhya Narayan Singh. If they are no longer in service, it asked the authorities concerned not to give them another opportunity in government service.Several human rights bodies had drawn similar conclusions. In its report in April 2007, Human Rights Watch remarked that there was no doubt that most, if not all, of the killings could have been prevented.As the Pushpa Kamal Dahal administration continued to ignore the commission’s recommendations, the relatives of the victims began a series of protests in Rautahat on July 29 last year. After six days of agitation, Dahal met the protesters and assured them of an investigation and constituting a home secretary-led panel to hold dialogue and deliver justice. The prime minister, however, didn’t keep his promise. He instead appointed Yadav as his deputy with an important Cabinet portfolio.Talking to the Post, Rup Sagar Upadhyay, coordinator of the Gaur Massacre Victims’ Struggle Committee, had said that though her party—the Maoist Centre—had been in power for years, it had failed to investigate the incident. She is wife to Narmadeshwar, one of the massacre victims.The Maoists have led the government four times while the party has been a part of almost all governments since 2008.The final hearing in Sah's petition will be held once the written clarification is furnished.

        "content": "With a fractured election mandate resulting in political instability from federal to provincial governments, there is growing sentiment in favour of amending the constitution to change the current electoral system.Soon after the change in power-sharing at the centre, almost all provincial governments have faced the problem. The CPN (Maoist Centre) ditched its earlier coalition partner Nepali Congress on March 4 and stitched a new ruling coalition with the CPN-UML.The electoral system is the reason behind the political instability, argue some political leaders. They also point to the need for constitutional amendment to address the issue. For instance, the mixed electoral system is often blamed for unstable governments.“The electoral system we are practising has been giving us fractured mandates, resulting in no single party winning a majority in Parliament,” chief whip of the Congress Ramesh Lekhak told the Post. “Therefore, public sentiment is building in favour of amending the constitution to reform the electoral system.”The UML chief whip, Mahesh Bartaula, also stands on the same ground as Lekhak on electoral reforms. But, Bartaula said, constitutional amendments to reform the electoral system would not happen immediately. “Indeed, the mixed electoral system that we are practising is not yielding desired results. Instead, it is causing political instability,” the UML chief whip told the Post. “If needed, our party is open to discussing its remedy.” For one, the parties whose political agendas do not align should not be allowed to form poll alliances, says Bartaula. “If we can control this practice of parties with differing ideologies forming alliances, this electoral system too can function well,” added Bartaula. Though some leaders are in favour of immediate constitutional amendment in order to give the country a semblance of stability, a two-thirds majority in the lower house of parliament is needed to do so. This means 182 seats in the 275-strong House. For that, Nepali Congress, the largest party in Parliament with 88 seats, and the UML, the second largest with 78 seats, need to come together. Even after that 16 more MPs' support is needed, but there will be a possibility of gaining that support if the two big parties make a joint effort, experts say. “Constitutional amendment is necessary to address the political instability that we are facing today,” political analyst Arun Kumar Subedi told the Post. “If the Congress allies with political forces other than the UML, chances of a constitutional amendment will be slim. Therefore, if the political parties are considering changing the electoral system by amending the constitution, the Congress and the UML should come together.”A question naturally arises: why should the Congress and the UML agree to power-sharing to amend the constitution and reform the electoral system, if it is a need of the day? It can also be done even if one among the two big parties sit in an oppositional bench.But a close aide of Deuba, on condition of anonymity, claims that should the Congress and UML stand together for constitutional amendment it will not be only for electoral reform, they will also address other pressing issues of the country.But Bartaula ruled out a power alliance with the Congress. “Reforming the election law might be one thing which will take its due course; it is not a matter of a day or two. However, our party is not considering a power equation with the Congress anytime soon,” Bartaula stressed.At an event organised by the UML to mark the Diamond Jubilee of the formation of the Nepal Communist Party on Monday, Maoist chair Dahal and UML chief KP Sharma Oli stood together to strengthen the cooperation between the communist parties. Amid the rumoured possibility of a governing partnership between the Congress and the UML in the near future, the chairmen of two communist parties vowed to strengthen the ties between the two communist forces.But the Congress leaders claim that the channel of discussion with the UML is open. History suggests that the Congress and the UML have cooperated only in special cases. The two parties first cooperated in the Krishna Prasad Bhattarai-led government during the promulgation of the constitution of Nepal back in 1990. Similarly, for the second time in the 1996 election, the two parties cooperated in the government led by Girija Prasad Koirala, and in the 2015, the two parties shared power in the government led by Sushil Koirala that promulgated the constitution of Nepal through the second constituent assembly. Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba’s close aide NP Saud told the Post that the two major political parties in the nation only work together on exceptional conditions. UML vice-chair Surendra Pandey, too, denied the possibility of forming an alliance with the Congress. “Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa has been talking about cooperation between the two parties, but we have had no concrete discussion on the matter,” Pandey told the post. “Politics is a game of possibility and we cannot completely rule out the prospect of future cooperation.”General Secretary of UML Shankar Pokharel, while addressing a press conference at the party headquarters Chyasal a few days ago, had said his party will be ready to work with the Congress if needed.“Naturally, when there is a crisis in democracy and challenges in the stability, the UML will not hesitate to work together with the Congress,” he said. But while addressing a national gathering of UML representatives on April 20, he said his party would like to continue the present coalition of the UML and the Maoists until the next election.Following the election in November 2022, the government has been headed by the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in Parliament with 32 seats, after no single party won a majority. Its chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal formed the government on December 25 of that year with the support of the UML, the second largest party in Parliament, along with the newly emerged Rastriya Swatantra Party and other fringe outfits.But in February 2023 Dahal ditched the UML within two months of government formation and rebuilt an alliance with the Congress. On March 4, Dahal rejoined the UML to form the government. Since the first constituent assembly election held in 2008, Nepal has been practising First-Past-the-Post and Proportional Representation (PR) election, a mixed electoral system that gives no party a clear majority in Parliament, resulting in a coalition government. One and a half years since the November 2022 federal and provincial elections, the federal and provincial governments have seen many ups and downs. The instability in central politics has made provincial governments unstable every time.Political leaders are using provincial governments as a power-sharing platform. The change in the power equation at the centre results in an immediate change in the provincial governments. At least 18 governments have formed in the seven provinces since the election held in November 2022. “Most of the time the provincial governments come into being due to the change in alliance at the centre,” UML deputy general secretary Prithvi Subba Gurung told the Post.But Gurung does not see any fault in the election system, denying the possibility of amending the election law. “Instability in provincial governments is not due to the failure of our election system or the provincial structures. It is a failure of our central-level leaders. Otherwise, they would not let developments at the centre affect the functioning of the provinces,” Gurung said.   "

        "content": "When Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal kicked out Nepali Congress from his coalition and embraced the CPN-UML on March 4, many political pundits interpreted the development as a course correction by two communist leaders who had parted ways three years ago following bitter disputes.The dramatic turn of events that led to the chairmen of the three communist parties—KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML, Dahal of the Maoist Centre and Madhav Kumar Nepal of the CPN (Unified Socialist)—coming together had many assume that the coalition was a prelude to communist unification. The three leaders were in the Nepal Communist Party—formed after unifying the CPN-UML and Maoist Centre in 2018 following an electoral alliance in 2017. The unity among the two largest parties, however, didn’t last for more than three years.As there are speculations about communist unity, this time around, the leaders seem cautious while speaking on reunification.Prime Minister and chair of the Maoist Centre Dahal and CPN-UML chair Oli on Monday expressed similar views on the reunification of communist parties. While addressing the ‘Diamond Jubilee’ of establishment of the Nepal Communist Party, the two leaders said that this time around they wouldn’t go for party unity in a haste.In 2017, the two largest communist parties—the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre— forged a pre-poll alliance and later unified the party. The parties together garnered almost a two-thirds majority in the federal parliament and Oli ran the first-ever communist majority government in the country. However, the party was embroiled in a feud between the factions led by the top leaders. Possibly, learning from the experience, Prime Minister Dahal, while addressing the event on Monday, said that they are not in a mood for communist unity immediately. “Now we are not in favour of communist unity, unlike in the past,” Prime Minister Dahal said. “I feel like we were a little too enthusiastic when we unified the party last time, but this time around we are focusing on cooperation to lay the ground for party unity.” Good cooperation among the communist bloc in the present government can pave the way for the party unity in the future, Dahal said.However, earlier in the day, Dahal’s message on the same issue was different while addressing a separate function in the presence of Madhav Kumar Nepal.Inaugurating the third annual central assembly meeting held by the Nar Bahadur Karmacharya Memorial Foundation at Chyasal, Lalitpur, Prime Minister Dahal emphasised unity between the communist forces.“The unity and cooperation among the communist parties of Nepal is necessary and the communist leaders should be ready even to take risks for that,” Prime Minister Dahal said. “We must take a risk for the unity of the communist parties, for national integrity and for the future of the communists. And we are on that path.”Dahal, however, changed his tone in the event where Oli was present. CPN-UML chair Oli is more cautious about making announcements about communist unity. “If the communist leaders express their desire for party unity not long after the split, a question will immediately be raised as to why we had split earlier,” Oli said.On April 20, while presenting his political report at a meeting of the CPN-UML’s National Representatives Council, party chair Oli expressed his reluctance to endorse the agenda of communist unity. Oli preferred alliance among like-minded forces over left polarisation.“Cooperation among like-minded parties is what we need,” Oli’s political report read. “But it is neither necessary nor beneficial to have polarisation of the communist or the socialist forces.”Oli further highlighted the need to foster trust and cooperation among various ideological groups, suggesting unity should evolve naturally as trust deepens.He, however, didn’t rule out unity among like-minded forces. “As cooperation between the parties deepens and an environment of trust is built, those like-minded parties gradually can come together,” he said.On Monday, Oli repeated the same message on communist unity. “This is not a time for communist unity; rather we need to join hands with other parties too,” he said. “People who are talking about the possibility of communist unity immediately are doing so just for their self-satisfaction.”A few days back, Unified Socialist General Secretary Ghanashayam Bhusal in a programme had said if UML and Maoists change their political attitude, the unity among the communist parties cannot be ruled out.Also, second-rung leaders don’t seem quite excited about party reunification.Earlier Bishnu Paudel, a vice-chair of the UML, in an interview with the Post had denied the immediate possibility of communist unity. Asked if the UML and the Maoist Centre could come together in the next election, Paudel said, “The UML will consolidate leftist forces. But the modality will be different. The phase of uniting parties by bringing together a handful of so-called bigwigs is over. We will instead bring together scattered genuine left groups and individuals.”When UML top leaders prefer cooperation among like-minded parties, former President Bidya Devi Bhandari, who was vice-chair of the UML before being elected as the President of Nepal in 2015, urged the leaders to ponder why communists in Nepal are divided into multiple parties. “When the Nepali Communist movement is celebrating the Diamond Jubilee, we also need to analyse the reason behind the split and divisions among the communist parties,” Bhandari said. “Have the communist parties of Nepal split due to differences in political principles and ideologies or is it happening due to positional aspirations of the leaders?”Khagendra Prasai, a left-leaning political analyst, said Nepali communist parties and their activities are not transparent. “They work in opaque ways. So it is hard to analyse their public statements,” he said. “Even second-rung leaders may not be informed about discussions among top leaders.”But if the statements put forward by the former President Bhandari are to be decoded, her intent seems to be in favour of the communist unity, Prasai said. “While the UML and Maoist Centre chairs seem reluctant on the party unity immediately, the former President seems to favour it,” he said.

        "content": "A writ petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Sunday challenging the formation of the government in Sudurpaschim Province. This follows a similar development in Gandaki Province.Laxman Kishore Chaudhary, leader of the Nagarik Unmukti Party, has demanded the nullification of the incumbent government in the province. He has claimed that Najir Miya, the province head, flouted the Constitution of Nepal in appointing Dirgha Sodari as the chief minister.After the resignation by Nepali Congress’ Kamal Bahadur Shah from the post of chief minister, Miya called the parties to present their claims to form a coalition government.In the 53-member Sudurpaschim assembly, the Congress has 19 members, the CPN (Maoist Centre) has 10, the CPN-UML 9, the Nagarik Unmukti Party 7, the CPN (Unified Socialist) has three, and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party has one, while there is one independent lawmaker. Any party claiming the government leadership must secure the support of at least 27 assembly members to prove a majority.On April 14, Laxman Kishor, who is regarded as close to the party’s influential leader Resham Chaudhary, had presented a claim for the government with the support of the Congress, the Unified Socialist and Rastriya Prajatantra Party. Similarly, Kailash Chaudhary, who is close to party chair Ranjeeta Shrestha, also claimed the government leadership with the support from the UML and the Maoist Centre.Province Head Miya did not take any decision arguing that two lawmakers from the same party claimed the chief ministerial position. So he gave parties two more days to come up with fresh claims. In between, the Unified Socialist withdrew its support to Laxman Kishor, one of the two aspirants for chief minister. On April 17, Sodari of the CPN (Unified Socialist) presented a claim to form a government with support from the UML, the Maoist Centre and a section of the Nagarik Unmukti Party.Laxman Kishor has claimed that the Province Head had mala fide intent in extending the deadline, even as he already had the support of the majority members of the assembly. The hearing of the petition has been slated for Monday.This is the second petition challenging the process of forming a government in provinces this month. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court, acting on a petition, stopped the Gandaki government from taking decisions with lasting implications.On April 10, the top court directed the Khagaraj Adhikari-led Gandaki Province government to refrain from taking any such decisions until the final verdict.The apex court had asked Gandaki Province Head Dilli Raj Bhatta to furnish a written response by April 19, asking why the court should not issue an order as sought by the plaintiff. A single bench of Justice Binod Sharma had issued the stay order responding to a writ petition by former chief minister Surendra Raj Pandey who had claimed that Adhikari’s appointment was unconstitutional.Province Head Dilliraj Bhatta appointed Adhikari to the position as per Article 168 (2) of the Constitution after he staked a claim for the chief ministerial position claiming that he had the support of a majority of provincial assembly members. Adhikari however included the Speaker in the list of supporters.Adhikari presented the support of 31 members—22 from his party, eight from the CPN (Maoist Centre) and an independent member. The eight from the Maoist Centre include Speaker Krishna Prasad Dhital. Support of 31 members is required for a minimum majority in the 60-strong provincial assembly.The Congress had urged Bhatta not to appoint Adhikari as chief minister, arguing that the claim of the UML-Maoist alliance was unconstitutional as they included Speaker Dhital as one of the supporters to elect Adhikari as chief minister. A Speaker in the legislature can’t take sides except while casting a vote in case of a tie in the assembly.On July 27 last year, the top court, setting a precedent, annulled the Uddhav Thapa-led Nepali Congress government in Koshi concluding that the Speaker cannot be a part of the government formation process.Following the court ruling, Adhikari has been unable to take a vote of trust from the provincial assembly. The Congress has announced a boycott of the assembly meeting called before the court verdict. "

        "content": "Around 200 private schools operating in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City have applied to the Education Department under the city office requesting time to change their names. Officials said that some schools have suggested new names, while others have committed to changing their foreign names within the deadline set by the metropolis.“Almost all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names have contacted us after receiving our ultimatum,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson at the metropolis. “Around 200 schools have already submitted applications for name changes, and some have also proposed alternative names.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2074, schools must adopt names that reflect Nepali identity.Officials said that schools should choose names from renowned persons who have made significant contributions to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places, deities, religious mythology, pilgrims sites, and heritages.“Each and every school operating within our jurisdiction must abide by the law and follow the instructions issued by relevant authorities,” said Manandhar. “Many schools have already contacted us and expressed their readiness to follow the instructions. We hope that the remaining schools will do the same, as the deadline has not yet passed.”The Education Department of the metropolis had warned that it would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. According to officials this would render examinations conducted by such schools invalid.Despite issuing similar notices in the past, officials said they are committed to enforce the law strictly this time.The metropolis said that out of over 850 schools operating in the metropolis 324 have foreign names. Enforcing Education Regulation 2059 and and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2074 is part of the metropolis’ efforts to improve school education. The metropolis has also started imparting training to over 2,000 school teachers working in government schools within its jurisdiction.Professors and experts from Kathmandu University are currently conducting a four-day training at 55 centres starting this Sunday, according to Shailendra Jha, a member of the City Planning Commission. Officials hope the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education, the learning outcome in government schools and make students there more competent.The City office had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Kathmandu University for capacity building of teachers, and conducting a study on the effectiveness of teaching-learning and child psychology, among others. For this, the metropolis has allocated over Rs28 million to Kathmandu University.The City office has already started book-free Fridays, in which people’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which the knowledge of interlinked subjects are provided. Officials said that they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills, into the curriculum of grades 4 to 8 for both mental and physical growth of students.

        "content": "On Thursday, Shalupa Khanal, 20, had just entered Kathmandu via Koteshwar after completing her recent trip to Sindhuli. She was greeted by Kathmandu’s usual chaotic crowd of commuters, all desperately fighting to secure their seats in a jam-packed four-wheeler. She hurriedly climbed on the first bus in sight, asking the conductor if that bus would take her home to Chabahil. “I remember asking the same question three times, to which I received a ‘yes’ in return each and every time,” said Khanal, who is a law student.After a while, she realised she was heading in the wrong direction and asked the conductor to stop the bus. To her surprise, the conductor ignored her persistent requests.“When I confronted the conductor for deceiving me, he pulled me outside and aggressively shoved me, shouting foul words and threats at me,” Khanal said.She was shocked and stranded in the middle of the road. “On top of the already uncivil and violent nature of the bus staff, bystanders witnessed everything and yet did nothing,” she said.For a long time, commuters have been complaining about Kathmandu’s poor public transport system. Public vehicles are usually crowded and, like Khanal, commuters are often subjected to harassment and indecent behaviour from fellow commuters and even the vehicles’ staff members. Despite this, the due accountability and justice seem elusive.It’s not only the young, even the elderly commuters, who enjoy seat reservations at public vehicles, complain of being mistreated by vehicle staff. Take, for instance, Ram Bhandari, 78, a retired corporate officer who often boards the supposedly more orderly Sajha Yatayat buses. Bhandari shares multiple incidents of mistreatment of elderly people. Sajha’s free-ride provision for the elderly and the people with disabilities is “a double-edged sword,” Bhandari said, recounting several incidents when conductors badgered him for money and remarked that someone with the inability to pay should not be boarding a bus.“Yes, we can get free rides around the city but we are also subject to mistreatment for using the same benefits,” he said.Bhandari recalled calling Sajha Yatayat’s office once to file a complaint against such uncouth behaviour. He got no response. “I have been using public vehicles my whole life,” Bhandari said with quiet resignation. “I guess some practices never change.”If even the Sajha Yatayat is not foolproof, microbuses are worse, as Kopila Tamang, 23, can attest. “Overcrowding is a big issue in microbuses as it encourages molesters,” Tamang said, adding that boarding micros without company is never an option for her and her friends. Meanwhile, students report of public vehicles’ inconsistency “messing up” with their school timings. “The buses arrive at inconsistent intervals and Sajha’s GPS trackers are also inaccurate,” said Rishav Maharjan, 17, a high-school student who commutes to his Jawalakhel school and back home on a public bus every day. With school timings coinciding with the office hours, Maharjan finds boarding overcrowded public vehicles extremely challenging.At the root of Kathmandu’s public transport problem is the existence of numerous uncoordinated private operators, Ashish Gajurel, an expert in traffic engineering, said. “Handing over such a critical responsibility to profit-driven private operators without standard regulations creates a big mess,” he said.Gajurel said tackling current problems in public transport requires greater investment on behalf of the government and proper monitoring mechanisms. “Ideally, public transport should be overseen by the government with an accurate estimation of demand, efficient supply, integrated ticket systems, proper route allocations,and coordination,” Gajurel said.Gajurel also points out the state’s negligence in monitoring the poor condition of Kathmandu’s public vehicles which not only inconveniences commuters but also contributes to the hundreds of road accidents in the city every year.For sustainable urban development, proper management of the public transportation system is a must, said Arjun Koirala, vice-president of the Regional and Urban Planners Society of Nepal (RUPSON), a non-profit. “Today, pedestrianisation and the integration of bicycle lanes have become significant elements to consider in Kathmandu's urban planning,” Koirala said.Koirala calls attention to the government’s usual pattern of formulating urban plans but never efficiently implementing them. However, he believes shifting all the blame on the government is wrong. “It is also our civic responsibility to believe in and support plans for urban development designed by the government,” he said.Transformation of Kathmandu's public transport system has always been a hot topic for politicians during elections. However, our policymakers have rarely walked the talk, experts say.Ishwori Paneru, information officer at the Department of Transport Management, acknowledged the existence of problems in the public transportation sector. “There are certain logistical problems but implementation is never perfect, especially when we give bus operators the right to run independently,” Paneru said.Citing the Motor Vehicle and Transport Management Act of 1993, Paneru talks about the provisions of punishments to keep drivers, conductors and passengers disciplined. This included fines ranging from Rs1,000 to Rs5,000 for the acts of mistreatment, sexual harassment, pick-pocketing and assault. On accountability, Sajha Yatayat Office acknowledged that they were having trouble connecting certain buses to their GPS tracking system and that the problems would be fixed by late April. Asked about the mistreatment of elderly on Sajha buses, the staff at Sajha Yatayat said that new employees were often unaware of provisions like the one provided to elderly people. “We do receive complaints about our staff behaviour and we also suspend or fire some of them,” a Sajha Yatayat official told the Post over phone on Thursday. “Passengers should note the number of the bus when filing a complaint so we can identify the employee and take appropriate action.”On the part of law enforcement, Superintendent of Police Bishwa Raj Khadka at Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office reassured the Post that the traffic police department had never been as vigilant as they are now. With more personnel active, public vehicles that cram people face legal consequences, Khadka claimed.“In cases of violent assault, sexual harassment or pickpocketing on the vehicle, passengers can dial 103 or directly lodge a complaint to traffic control at the number 9851295100,” Khadka said.On cases of mistreatment, Khadka said the number of complaints against drivers and conductors is decreasing.He also informed of passenger awareness campaigns being conducted by traffic police, like the one happening at all of Kathmandu Valley’s major crossways on Sunday.“Our staff including senior officers listen to the troubles of the general public, address them and spread awareness about crucial traffic safety rules,” Khadka said. “Awareness and civil obedience are vital in maintaining proper traffic decorum.” "

        "content": "Over 1,000 unemployed youths from the Kathmandu Metropolitan City have applied for work at the labour bank initiated by the metropolis, while around 400 have been employed by the city office itself.Officials at the labour bank of the metropolis said that the number of unemployed seeking employment has been rising of late.“Many people, even if they are unemployed, do not know about the services initiated by the metropolis,” said Pawan Kumar Thakur, coordinator of the labour bank of the metropolis. “Number of people seeking employment has been rising significantly of late.”Officials at the KMC said that the labour bank has been started to assist unemployed youths to find jobs and help private organisations, companies and business entities operating in the metropolis in finding the required workforce.The City office itself has given employment to around 400 jobseekers in the infrastructure building, repair and maintenance, cleaning, environmental conservation, and river cleaning, among other sectors.“We are hiring over 50 cleaning staff who have applied in the labour bank to clean the rivers of the metropolis,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the KMC. “Around two dozen staff have already been employed for river cleaning.”The metropolis has also been using excavators to remove objects stuck in the middle of the river. Hundreds of tons of garbage have already been removed from the Bagmati and Bishnumati river.Apart from this, the city office has mobilised dozens of staffers to keep the city clean.The city office has also hired 300 cleaning staff—150 men and 150 women—who are being deployed to collect waste discarded in public places, including roadsides.According to Thakur, anybody—whether educated or uneducated, skilled or unskilled—can apply for a job at the labour bank if they are unemployed. However, one should be a metropolis' resident or a temporary resident to apply for the job. Locals from two local units of Banchare Danda landfill site can also apply.“Engineers, electricians, painters, plumbers, and painters have applied for the jobs,” said Thakur. “Anyone having any kind of skill can apply. We do not charge anything from the unemployed youths and one can apply online.”Officials said that organisations and companies can also approach the metropolis for workforce. They say that they will link companies and unemployed youths.According to officials, one can apply for a job in electrical, electronics, computer and laptop maintenance; cutting and sewing; beauty parlour and saloon; in hospitality as cook and barista; in construction as tiles and marble fitter; agriculture; professional computer hardware networking and CCTV camera installation; software development; plumbing; as construction labourer and mason; in motorcycle repair and maintenance; and carpentry, among others.The KMC has also started segregating household waste as degradable and non-degradable at its waste transfer station in Teku and landfill site in Bancharedanda. Officials say that waste segregation has started from wards 5, 12 and 27.Non-degradable waste such as plastic and metal will be sold while the degradable variety will be transferred to the dumping site, they said.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures that Mayor Balendra Shah said would help solve Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah had asked city residents to start segregating waste at home. But the measure didn’t work out, largely due to a lack of preparation on the KMC’s part.Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. "

They were convicted as per clause 192(5) of the Criminal Code.Chalaune, who teaches sociology at the university campus in Kirtipur, was brutally assaulted on the campus premises on October 6, 2020, by a gang including Acharya, TU chapter president of the Nepali Congress-affiliated Nepal Students Union (NSU); Rawal, secretary of the same organisation, along with other members of the union.Chalaune had sustained serious injuries on his head, chest and thighs, and spent a month in hospital. As the assailants enjoyed close ties with the ruling party of that time, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet on June 13 last year decided to withdraw the cases against them even as a case of attempted murder against the assailants was sub judice at the district court.The decision was widely criticised but Dahal’s ministers at the time defended it saying that Chalaune had provoked the students. The Supreme Court ordered the government not to implement its decision to withdraw the cases. "

        "content": "The Kathmandu Metropolitan City said that it has been preparing to dispose of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste separately at the landfill site in Bancharadanda in Nuwakot district.The move aims to reduce the quantity of waste materials in the landfill site and to produce compost from biodegradable waste, according to officials. “We will soon start disposing of segregated waste separately at the landfill site,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “We are also planning to make it mandatory for private waste collectors and local units to segregate waste. Waste segregation is the only way to reduce the volume of waste at the landfill site.”The city office has already started segregation of household waste from wards 27, 10 and 5. Officials said disposable waste is being dumped separately at its waste transfer station at Teku. Officials informed that some of the waste is being converted into compost and some degradable waste is going into a bio-methanation plant, which was provided by the European Union.When the gas from the plant is filled in biogas balloons, it can later be used to generate electricity or to cook. The KMC facility can generate 15 kilowatts of electricity from biogas.The metropolis has been also using reagents to expedite the process of making compost.“We will enforce waste segregation rules in all 32 wards of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City first, and then ask other local units in the Kathmandu Valley and private waste collector companies to comply with the rules,” said Shrestha.Officials say the 32 wards of the metropolis will be divided into eight blocks and the waste materials will be segregated in the respective blocks. The metropolis has also deployed 300 cleaning staff—150 men and 150 women—to collect waste discarded at public places, including roadsides and riverbanks.The metropolis has arranged five additional garbage trucks to collect segregated waste materials.Officials hope that the compost will be ready in two months. Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. Upon assuming office, Shah asked city residents to segregate waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan did not succeed, largely due to a lack of preparations on the part of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City office.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste a day, and nearly 60 percent of this comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.Meanwhile, the Agriculture and Veterinary Department of the metropolis said that it has completed sterilisation of over 5,300 street dogs in the ongoing fiscal year. Along with sterilisation, the metropolis had also launched a campaign to administer anti-rabies vaccine to stray dogs. “Over 17,000 dogs residing in the streets of the metropolis have been vaccinated under the campaign,” said Dr Awadhesh Jha, chief of the department. “The remaining dogs will be also vaccinated and sterilised as the campaign continues.”The metropolis had also planned to microchip all dogs kept as pets in households within the metropolis, but officials said that due to various reasons, they could not start the programme.Jha said the goal is to discourage owners from abandoning their pets when they get old or sick. Officials estimate that there are around 20,000 pet dogs in the 32 wards of the metropolis.Pet microchips are tiny devices that are inserted under a pet’s skin. The chips can be scanned and owners’ information stored in them easily accessed. "

        "content": "Yingming Yang is the vice-president of the Asian Development Bank’s South, Central and West Asia regions. He joined ADB in January 2024. Yang is responsible for operations in the bank’s South Asia and the Central and West Asia departments. He is currently in Kathmandu to attend the Nepal Investment Summit. In an email interview with the Post's Sangam Prasain, Yang spoke on a range of issues, including ADB’s support for improving Nepal’s business climate, agricultural productivity, enhancing the skills of youth, supporting private sector investments, investing in hydropower, transport connectivity and digital development and supporting climate mitigation and disaster risk management. Excerpts: You are here to attend the Nepal Investment Summit. What are your expectations from the summit? I am delighted to be here in Nepal, and it is an honour for me to participate in the Nepal Investment Summit 2024. I would like to extend my congratulations to the government of Nepal for hosting this important event. Nepal is at a crucial juncture, welcoming investors and highlighting progressive changes that have improved the business climate in recent years. Nepal deserves global attention as a promising investment destination, and this summit provides an ideal platform to showcase the opportunities that Nepal has to offer to investors. Nepal has taken proactive measures to ensure key reforms are underway and these are crucial steps toward unlocking the full potential of the private sector. It is also important to ensure effective implementation for translating policies into tangible outcomes. Eventually, I hope the summit paves the path for greater investment mobilisation, from domestic and international investors. I think Nepal should institute a regular process of introducing reforms and being responsive to investor concerns. How would you describe ADB’s relationship with Nepal when it comes to investing in developing countries? Over the past five decades and more, dating back to 1969, Nepal and the ADB have worked hand in hand to address the country's most pressing development needs and improve the lives of its people. From building roads, and airports, and enhancing energy and water systems to supporting education, skills development, and agriculture, ADB has been a key partner in Nepal's development journey. We take immense pride in our partnership with the people and the government of Nepal. As of the end of last year, ADB's active portfolio in Nepal stood at around $3.6 billion, supporting a broad range of key sectors, including energy, transport, agriculture, water, urban infrastructure and services, rural development and natural resources and education. We are committed to scaling up our support to Nepal in partnership with the government, the private sector and development partners. Nepal is due to graduate from its current status, as one of the world's least-developed countries, in 2026. This means Nepal will also lose benefits from certain preferential provisions laid out in different WTO agreements, including the official development assistance. What will be the ADB's role in facilitating Nepal's graduation process through the transition phase?  The fact that Nepal is set to graduate from the least developed country (LDC) category in 2026 underscores the progress made over the past decades despite numerous challenges, including political changes, natural disasters, and the Covid-19 pandemic. For this graduation to be sustainable, Nepal must focus on achieving inclusive and robust economic growth by enhancing productivity and competitiveness in the economy. ADB is currently conducting a diagnostic study titled ‘Nepali Exports: Firm-level Evidence’, which will suggest policy recommendations to inform its new Country Partnership Strategy (2025–2029). The study will provide insights into fostering Nepal’s export growth and supporting the transition to a new growth model based increasingly on competitiveness, export diversification, and employment creation. Under ADB’s country partnership strategy for Nepal, which we are currently developing in close alignment with the World Bank’s country partnership framework, ADB will facilitate Nepal’s transition to the developing country status. This will be achieved through measures such as improving the business climate, increasing agricultural productivity, enhancing the skills of youth, supporting private sector investments, investing in hydropower, transport connectivity and digital development, and supporting climate mitigation and adaptation, and disaster risk management.  Despite rapid poverty reduction, Nepal's development path is not helping it escape a low-growth trap. What should Nepal do to accelerate development, and achieve higher and inclusive economic growth? While progress has been made in reducing poverty over the past two decades, Nepal's GDP growth has been moderate, averaging 4-5 percent annually. Productivity growth has been low, primarily due to reliance on remittance-dependent private consumption. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates Nepal's long-term economic growth at just above 5 percent, which falls short of the 7 to 8 percent needed to transition to an upper-middle-income country, given its lower-middle-income status. To achieve growth, Nepal needs structural economic reforms. While the services sector has grown slightly, this growth hasn't translated into enough job opportunities, largely due to prevailing informal activities.To expedite development, Nepal must enhance private sector competitiveness and global market integration. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been minimal, constituting less than 1 percent of the GDP. Political stability, improved infrastructure, and consistent policy reforms are necessary to attract more FDI, particularly in manufacturing and services. Beyond these, Nepal should prioritise the export promotion of IT services, tourism, and hydropower. Support from ADB and other development partners has improved the energy sector's reliability and sustainability, facilitating cross-border trade. Additionally, ADB's assistance in developing sustainable transport infrastructure and trade facilitation will reduce costs for firms, improve market access for people, and create more employment opportunities. What is green financing? How will green finance help Nepal leverage its potential, particularly in renewable energy?Green financing refers to financial instruments, investments, and mechanisms specifically designed to support environmentally sustainable projects or activities. These could include initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions, promoting renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, conserving natural resources, or mitigating climate change impacts. Green financing can take various forms, such as green bonds, green loans, green mortgages, and green investment funds. In Nepal, the government and private sector, supported by development partners, continue to invest substantially in hydropower, a renewable and green source of energy. However, access to financing remains a major constraint. Green finance mechanisms, such as green bonds, loans, and investment funds, can provide additional capital to develop renewable energy projects. This access to capital can help accelerate the deployment of renewable energy infrastructure, leading to increased energy generation.It is expected that climate change will adversely affect Nepal’s biodiversity, human well-being, and economy. Is there any support ADB is extending to Nepal to mitigate disaster and climate change effects?We commend Nepal for its comprehensive National Adaptation Plan and Nationally Determined Contribution. We recognise the government’s commitment to achieving a net-zero climate emission target by 2045. ADB’s operations in Nepal are aligned with these plans and targets. Furthermore, ADB’s operations in Nepal are aligned with Nepal's home-grown Green, Resilient, Inclusive Development (GRID) strategy, which is being supported by 16 key development partners.Currently, ADB Nepal is preparing a GRID policy-based programme with a strong climate focus, expected to be approved in 2024. Additionally, there are several initiatives and technical assistance projects on climate change and disaster risk management. One of the main initiatives is the Building Adaptation and Resilience in the Hindu Kush Himalayas—Bhutan and Nepal, aimed at boosting the two countries’ ability to evaluate multi-hazard risks, improve multi-hazard risk management, and examine innovative finance strategies for climate-resilient investments.Moreover, ADB is preparing a large-scale financing facility, the Green and Resilience Financing Facility, to help the government implement projects identified in the National Adaptation Plan. The goal of the facility is to raise $1 billion in highly concessional loans and grant financing. Globally, ADB aims to achieve $100 billion in cumulative climate finance using its resources between 2019 and 2030.There are questions raised in the project financed by ADB. Large infrastructure projects in Nepal have been delayed even during times when the politics was stable. What’s the reason behind the delays in your assessment? Delays in delivering large infrastructure projects are a common challenge in many developing countries. Broader governance and capacity issues, along with project-specific challenges, affect project effectiveness and efficiency. In Nepal, factors like fragile geology, natural disasters, remote locations, and limited working seasons add complexity beyond individual projects' control.The transition to federalism has improved service delivery but poses challenges in devolving functions, functionaries, and funds. Timely project implementation requires strong, continuous project leadership with less frequent changes in staffing and adequate authority delegation. Involving project stakeholders from the outset is essential.I firmly believe that leveraging new technologies can significantly improve project progress and alleviate implementation bottlenecks. Resolving issues like poor contractor performance and delays in land acquisition and permissions requires updating legal frameworks and digitisation of clearance processes. It's essential to address concerns such as contract management, environmental safeguards, and governance constraints to enhance project implementation and ensure the timely delivery of development results on the ground.We appreciate the efforts of the government to address administrative and policy-level issues related to investment project cycle management. ADB has recently initiated a technical assistance project to enhance procurement efficiency and quality, improve contract management and execution tools, digitise environmental and forest cutting clearances, harmonise project readiness processes among ADB, the World Bank, and the government, and enhance interagency coordination.In recent years, Nepal has been confronted with the phenomenon of brain drain. The number of youths leaving the country in pursuit of better opportunities in foreign lands continues to grow. In your view, what strategy should Nepal adopt to stop the brain drain?  The lack of adequate decent job opportunities in Nepal serves as a critical \"push factor\" for outmigration. Foreign employment emerges as an attractive alternative for those struggling to find jobs domestically. Most migrant workers have less than a secondary education and work in low-skilled and semi-skilled jobs abroad, with only a small percentage employed in professional or high-skilled roles.While remittances contribute significantly to Nepal's GDP (accounting for about 22.7 percent in the fiscal year 2022-23) and play a crucial role in economic growth and poverty reduction, Nepal cannot solely depend on migration and remittances as primary economic drivers. These factors are highly contingent on economic and political conditions in host countries and mainly boost private consumption, leading to low productivity growth.Nepal’s economic policy must promote sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that generates ample job opportunities. Currently, many youths are seeking employment abroad due to the lack of acceptable opportunities at home. To address this, Nepal should prioritise promoting safe migration by enhancing the skills of migrant youth, enabling them to secure better-paying jobs with improved working conditions in host countries, while also reducing the cost of remitting money back to Nepal. Moreover, in the medium to longer term, Nepal's development objectives should increasingly focus on investing in infrastructure, productive capacity, productivity growth, and job creation within the country.  What is your assessment of the progress that Nepal has made in infrastructure and development?Nepal has made significant strides in expanding its infrastructure, but it still lags behind middle-income economies in Asia. For landlocked Nepal, roads serve as a critical lifeline, transporting 90 percent of passengers and goods. In recent years, extensive strategic road networks and rural roads have emerged, connecting previously remote areas to markets and the outside world. However, while developing new infrastructure, Nepal also needs to ensure better maintenance of the assets already created. Investments in improving roads and related infrastructure have been a crucial part of ADB’s strategy in Nepal to reduce poverty and support economic growth.Through various projects and initiatives, ADB has supported the government of Nepal in enhancing infrastructure, including roads, airports, energy systems, water management, and urban facilities. These efforts aim to improve connectivity, promote economic growth, and enhance the overall quality of life for the people of Nepal. ADB is also assisting cities in Nepal in building climate-resilient infrastructure.In recent years, Nepal has seen remarkable growth in its energy sector, with a surge in hydropower projects, policy initiatives, and cross-border collaborations aimed at meeting domestic energy needs and fostering regional energy integration. Just about fifty years ago, the electrification rate hovered around 2 percent. Half a century later, Nepal has witnessed incredible transformation. Over 95 percent of households now have access to grid electricity, and the country is exporting electricity to generate foreign currency. We are incredibly proud of our over five decades of partnership with the government of Nepal in the energy sector. Nepal has also witnessed significant advancements in telecommunications over the past decade, with mobile phone penetration reaching even the remotest locations. This has huge implications for the advancement of the digital economy.What are the areas that ADB is seeking to support Nepal in the upcoming future?ADB continues to support Nepal’s green, resilient, and inclusive development strategy by investing in infrastructure, improving access to basic services, and safeguarding poor and vulnerable populations from disaster and climate risks. Additionally, ADB will continue to collaborate with Nepal to strengthen institutional capacities for sector planning, enhance project readiness and implementation performance, and ensure sustainable asset management.In our forthcoming CPS for 2025–2029, being developed jointly with the World Bank’s country partnership framework, ADB will prioritise fostering high, sustainable, green, and job-intensive economic growth in Nepal. This involves promoting the green economic transformation to create employment opportunities by enhancing the business climate, increasing agricultural productivity, improving youth employability, and supporting private sector investments.Furthermore, ADB will maintain its commitment to investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, including renewable energy generation, transmission, and distribution, as well as enhancing national, provincial, and local transport connectivity and improving accessibility to urban infrastructure and services. Additionally, we will support enhancing the capacity of federal and sub-national governments and improving access to and the quality of school education, alongside strengthening local governance for education delivery. ADB remains dedicated to advancing gender equality and social inclusion, promoting digital development, and implementing comprehensive climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, including disaster risk management.  "

        "content": "Nepal’s Department of Industry has been awash with trademark, patent and design infringement complaints, government officials admitted as the country marked World Intellectual Property Day on Friday.Weak policy enforcement and unstable government for a long time have promoted unlawful use, selling, or copying of patented inventions.“We have so far received 1,500 complaints regarding trademarks, patents and designs,” said Yagyaraj Koirala, director general of the Department of Industry. “The number shows people are becoming aware of protecting their rights.” However, industry insiders say settling infringement-related cases in Nepal can take years or even decades. That’s because the Department of Industry which handles infringement cases is not a fully judicial body, and instead depends on the country’s judicial system, which is notorious for delays.Koirala said that they have prepared a draft law to supersede the existing Patent, Design and Trademark Act of 1965.“The draft is in the final stage.”He said that around 113,000 old files of intellectual property rights in the department related to trademarks, patents and design have been digitised. The department said it is in the final stage of developing an intellectual property management information system. “The department is also working to establish a technology innovation centre with the support of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to check patents online,” Koirala said.Every year, World Intellectual Property Day is observed to spread awareness about the importance of safeguarding intellectual property rights.Nepal became a member of WIPO in February 1997. WIPO is the global forum for intellectual property policy, services, information and cooperation.Intellectual property rights are the rights given to persons over the creations of their minds. Intellectual property rights include patents, copyrights, industrial design rights, trademarks, plant variety rights, trade dress, geographical indications, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets.The Constitution of Nepal has also guaranteed intellectual property rights as a fundamental right.According to the Global Innovation Index 2023 report by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Nepal ranked 108th out of 132 countries surveyed. Nepal ranked 24th among 37 lower middle-income groups of economies. “Nepal’s position on the Global Innovation Index is disappointing, indicating that the country has a lot more to do improve in the intellectual property rights fronts,” said Dik Bahadur Karki, director at the Department of Industry, addressing a function titled ‘IP and SDGs: Building our Common Future with Innovation and Creativity’.The event was organised jointly by the Intellectual Property Protection Society Nepal and the Department of Industry.The participants said that inadequate fines provisioned by the law also prompted trademark and patent infringement in Nepal. For example, under the existing Patent, Design and Trade Mark law, offenders can be fined Rs100,000 and have their property seized for misusing a registered trademark.During the function, a government official too admitted that anyone can pay the fine and misuse the trademarks and patents.Experts say that the weak implementation of the law has discouraged foreign investors from investing in Nepal.While there have been increasing complaints, applications for trademark registration have also been increasing. However, patent and design registration has been low.According to the Department of Industry, it received 876 applications for patents till mid-April.The department, however, has issued only 88 patents—52 for domestic and 36 for foreign companies. Similarly, the department received 785 applications for designs. The department, however, has issued designs for only 310 companies during the review period. Out of them, 114 were issued for domestic and 196 for foreign firms.The department received 113,607 applications for trademarks but was able to issue only 63,204.Out of the total issuance, 34,363 were for the domestic and 28,841 for the foreign companies.“The registration of patent and design is very disappointing. The lower number of registrations of patents and designs do not encourage industrialisation,” said Karki, the chief of the Industrial Property Section at the Industry Department. “But trademark registrations have been increasing during the last four years,” he said.“Almost 99 percent of intellectual property rights in Nepal involves trademarks. The share of patent and design is only 1 percent,” said Karki.Trademark protections include the word, sign, picture, or combination thereof to differentiate the product from others in the market.The laws governing trademarks never expire. This means the holder has the right to the trademark for the life of the product or service. “But in Nepal, there is no provision for assigning validity dates to trademarks,” said Karki. “In other countries, a trademark can be registered for one to 45 years.”“The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act is outdated, which does not cover geographical indication, utility model, and traditional knowledge among others,” said Karki.The other problem, according to Karki, is the manual registration process of intellectual property rights, which is full of hassles and discourages service seekers.“Cases of trademark infringement and counterfeiting are rising in Nepal alarmingly,” said Karki.In Nepal, trademark infringement and counterfeit products of multinational companies are sharply increasing. For instance, products like Coca-Cola, Mountain Dew, and KFC are available in the name of Club-Cola, Maintain Dew or Monsoon Dew and KKFC.Experts said that foreign direct investment from the US in Nepal has been declining due to the lack of a compensation law, which is the number one priority for American investors. As duplicate products are easily available in the market, US investors fear putting money in the country.Even if a well-known trademark is being stolen, there is no provision in Nepal’s law to differentiate between well-known and lesser-known trademarks. The well-known trademark is generally published in the Nepal Gazette, but till now, there is no such example of a trademark being published in the Nepal Gazette, according to the participants.    "

        "content": "Pascal Blenc and Sujanne Blenc, a French couple, are currently in Pokhara for a sightseeing tour.The couple was inspired to visit Pokhara after reading ‘Annapurna’, a book by French climber Maurice Herzog, the leader of the 1950 French Annapurna expedition.The first ascent of the 8,091-metre Mt Annapurna I in June 1950 by Herzog put Pokhara on the global map and established it as the gateway to the Annapurna region, a haven for trekkers.In the 1970s and late 1980s, Pokhara remained a favourite destination for Western hippies.On Tuesday, the Post caught up with the couple taking in the serene Fewa Lake. “Skies are hazy. I don’t think we will be able to view Mt Annapurna from here,” the 71-year-old Pascal said.They plan to trek the Ghodepani-Poonhill route, an all-year short trek suitable for everyone with a beautiful view of the Annapurna.“Next week, our dream is going to be fulfilled. We hope there will be no pollution in the mountains,” said Sujanne, 74. Pokhara provides a spectacular view of three eight-thousanders—Annapurna I, Dhaulagiri and Manaslu. Similarly, Mt Machhapuchchhre enthrals both domestic and foreign visitors.People posing for pictures with a Machhapuchchhre background is a common sight in Pokhara.But that could change if the pollution issues are not tackled, experts say.Nowadays, even during the spring, Pokhara is shrouded in thick haze. Locals said that since March, the sky of Pokhara has been filled with dust and haze. The air is not healthy. The mountains, too, are not visible.Dal Bahadur Shrestha and his six-member family from Sankhamool, Kathmandu reached Pumdi Bhumdi, a small village located in the hills of Pokhara, on Tuesday. But they were not able to see the mountain ranges. Even the Fewa Lake and Pokhara bazaar were covered in haze.“This time we could not enjoy ourselves, unlike in the previous vacation,” said Shrestha, who is in Pokhara for the fifth time. “It’s sad when you cannot see mountains from Pokhara. The skies are hazy here.”Until a few years ago, Pokhara, which has recently been declared Nepal’s tourist capital, was an exceptional city without air pollution. Now, during the spring, one of the country's peak tourist seasons, the bowl-sized city is blanketed in smog and haze. Flights are cancelled or delayed due to the poor visibility caused by the haze.Even with the current level of eye-searing smog, travel trade entrepreneurs are bracing for worse days ahead in the popular tourist destination. Pokhara in west-central Nepal is the second most popular tourist destination in the country after the capital Kathmandu.“Foreign tourists are reluctant to go on sightseeing tours when the skies are covered with thick smog,” said Ananda Gurung, president of Pokhara City Tour Guide Association. “Pollution could soon emerge as a big problem.”“Tourists have started to shorten their stays,” according to Gurung.Pomnarayan Shrestha, president of the Pokhara Tourism Council, said if the government does not act on time, pollution could have serious consequences for Pokhara’s burgeoning tourism industry.There are spillover effects of smog pollution in other villages of Kaski.Sikles village, situated at the northeast of Pokhara, was once a favourite hill station for tourists to view Annapurna mountains. But the area is also covered by pollution. Paras Gurung, president of Sikles Hotel Management Committee, said growing wildfire has been making the situation worse.Recently, a wildfire has spread in the nearby forest of Taprang, he said. Tourists inquire whether mountains are visible from Sikles, he said. “We cannot lie to our guests. But if the situation does not improve, we will lose everything. Many bookings have been cancelled.”Tourists in Sikles have started to cut short their stay because of the pollution, Gurung said.“There were wildfire cases in the past but for a short period. In the last 2-3 years, the smog billows from the forest and remains in the skies for longer, until the rain arrives,” said Gurung.Smog has spread from Pokhara to the Annapurna areas. Mountains are not visible from Ghandruk as well, a popular tourist spot, said Hira Malla, a trekking guide. Malla said that she was hired by two foreigners for Mardi, Ghandruk, and Ghorepani-Poonhill-Khopra treks for 14 days, but they requested to shorten the itinerary due to the haze-covered skies.“We then returned to Pokhara on the 11th day.”According to IQAir, an international company that monitors air pollution, the air quality in Pokhara reached an “unhealthy” level on Monday, with an AQI reading of 164. On Tuesday, it was 152. Due to poor visibility caused by pollution, flights were halted at the Pokhara International Airport for hours.Hum Bahadur Gurung, a sustainable development activist, said that apart from wildfire, pollution that travels miles from India often causes haze in Pokhara. “It has impacted the mountain villages. The impact can be dire for the rural economy which depends on tourism,” Gurung said. The income of hotels and homestays will decline if the tourist number drops because of air pollution, he said.According to the Forest Division Office, Pokhara, wildfires have spread in 5,000 hectares of forests since February. In addition, farmers in most of the southern Tarai plains light farm fires before planting maize.Experts said that Nepali farmers too started to use fire to burn vegetation due to the shortage of manpower to collect the straw. In past years, the majority of farmers did not burn vegetation and preferred to handle straw in other ways to feed their livestock.Komal Raj Kaphle, chief of the Forest Division Office, Kaski, said that to minimise the forest fires, the community has the main role to play. “There is a need to create awareness among the people not to ignite a flame in the forest. The forest ministry needs to make a detailed plan to raise awareness,” he said.f "

        "content": "The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division says all preparations for a mass drug administration drive have been completed in seven districts where the lymphatic filariasis disease, known more commonly as elephantiasis, is endemic. All healthy people above two years of age will be administered anti-elephantiasis in the two-week-long campaign, which is set to kick off on Sunday in six districts of the Tarai region—Jhapa, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Sarlahi, Rautahat, and Kapilvastu—and the mountain district of Rasuwa.“Healthy people above two years will be given diethylcarbamazine, albendazole and Ivermectin,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “This could be the last year of the campaign, as preparations have been made as per the strategy to cover all eligible populations.”Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease caused by filarial worms transmitted by different species of mosquitoes, including Culex, Anopheles, and Aedes.It is the second major infectious disease after leprosy that causes permanent and long-term disability in Nepal.Doctors say the disease may be acquired during childhood and its visible manifestation may occur only later in life. The disease can lead to temporary or permanent disability, pain, and social stigma.The World Health Organisation identifies the disease as a major public health problem, with an increasing prevalence worldwide. Nepal is one of the 73 countries where lymphatic filariasis is endemic.Health workers, as well as female community health volunteers in the campaign districts, will also visit every household to make sure that no one is deprived of antiparasitic drugs.Last year, antiparasitic drugs were administered in 15 districts. According to Dahal, some districts—Morang, Bara, Lamjung, Parbat, Baglung, Banke, Dang and Kailali, which were endemic to elephantiasis earlier—passed the threshold in a preliminary transmission survey, meaning they had halted the disease’s transmission rate.The health ministry carries out a transmission survey every two years. Such a survey needs to be performed three times in six years. When all surveys show a halt in the transmission rate, the country will be eligible for the status of having eliminated the disease.The Ministry of Health and Population has started administering Ivermectin, an antiparasitic that has been listed for the mass drug administration campaign, after diethylcarbamazine and albendazole failed to yield desired results in some districts.Dahal said that two two-year mass drug administration campaigns would be sufficient to stop the transmission rate when Ivermectin is used.The government started a mass drug administration programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in 2003. Under the programme, healthy persons above two years of age in 63 districts were given diethylcarbamazine and albendazole.The Mass Drug Administration campaign has already been completed in 53 districts. An agency under the Health Ministry has been carrying out transmission surveys in four districts.So far, the disease has been eliminated from 70 out of 77 districts. In some districts, the programme has continued for the last 14 years.The government had committed to eliminating lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem by 2020. However, the target could not be achieved due to low programme coverage in some districts. The Health Ministry had extended the deadline to eliminate lymphatic filariasis to 2028. Later, it was postponed further to 2030. Health officials said that this year's campaign could be the last, as the government does not have the budget to continue the campaign further. “Due to budget cuts in healthcare, it will not be possible to continue the programme next year,” said Dr Sangeeta Kaushal Mishra, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We would like to request all eligible people to take the anti-elephantiasis medicines, which are safe and effective.” "

        "content": "Nepal missed the malaria elimination target, and this is official.The government had committed to earning the ‘malaria-free’ status in 2026, for that the country needs to bring down indigenous cases or local transmission of the disease to zero, achieve zero deaths from 2023, and sustain zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.However, new cases of indigenous malaria have been reported in 2023 and 2024, which shattered all prospects to eliminate the disease from the country. “It is not possible to eliminate malaria by 2025, as indigenous cases of the deadly disease have been reported in 2023 and 2024,” said Dr Sangeeta Kaushal Mishra, director general of the Department of Health Services. “The new deadline is yet to be set but it could be 2030.”Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes carry these deadly parasites, according to the World Health Organisation. Indigenous malaria cases are locally transmitted, in which infected persons do not have a history of travel to malaria-affected countries.Of the 528 cases of malaria infections reported in the last fiscal year, 23 were indigenous. Of the 505 imported cases, over 80 percent were imported from India. Some cases of malaria were imported from African countries. Nepali security personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions in the countries having armed conflicts tested positive for malaria.Officials say the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in Nepal unless India eliminates it first.“Due to proximity, and an open and porous border between Nepal and India and unregulated travel of people of both countries, it is impossible to eliminate malaria here in Nepal, until the disease gets eliminated in India,” said Mishra. Officials say several other factors including cuts in the health budget of government and aid agencies, and shifts in vectors transmitting malaria to the hills and mountains due to global warming also pose serious challenges to meeting the elimination target. Apart from this, most health facilities across the country lack entomologists, which is necessary to carry out surveillance. “Unlike in the past, when malaria was concentrated in Tarai districts, a large number of cases are now being reported from hill and mountain districts,” said Dr Rudra Marasini, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. Malaria has been reported even in the mountain districts of Mugu, Bajura, and Humla, which were considered non-endemic in the past. “Carrying out surveillance in the hill and mountain districts is more challenging than in Tarai districts,” Marasini said, citing geographical difficulties.The UN report ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases affected by climate drivers have recently emerged in Nepal and are considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also shows increasing evidence that global warming has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquito vectors above 2,000 meters in Nepal.Malaria-related deaths had stopped since 2016, but five years later, in 2021, the country recorded one death from the disease.Officials at the health ministry said that until recent years Plasmodium Vivax, a protozoan parasite, was responsible for most of the malaria cases in the country, which causes relatively less severe disease. However, cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which most often cause severe and life-threatening malaria, have been rising. The parasite is common in many countries in Africa and the Sahara desert. "

        "content": "In a bid to ensure the quality of medicines being prescribed to patients, the Department of Drug Administration (DDA) has been preparing to carry out on-site tests of medicines.For that the national drugs regulatory body has imparted training to its 28 drugs inspectors and technicians, who will be deployed to hospitals across the country.“A four-day field-based screening training for drug inspectors has been completed today,” said DDA Director General Narayan Prasad Dhakal. “Our drug inspectors carried out testing of drugs at Bir Hospital as a demonstration on Tuesday.”Officials at the department said many countries have been practicing drug testing outside the laboratory, which gives immediate results within minutes of the collection of samples. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) has provided technical as well as financial support to carry out field based screening training.Officials said that basic qualities of the drugs—identification, disintegration, visual inspection for cracks, splitting, capping and cavitation, as well as contamination, foreign matter, presence of empty capsule, stickiness, color and odor of the solution, taste of liquid, labeling, brand name, generic name, among others, will be examined during on-site testing.During demonstration testing carried out at Bir hospital on Tuesday, metronidazole of three different companies—two Nepali companies and one of Indian companies were examined. Officials said that they did not find any problems in the medicine samples collected randomly from pharmacies operating near the hospital.Ensuring quality of medicine in Nepal has always become an issue, as the national drug regulatory body struggles with a shortage of staff, and its laboratory doesn't have capacity to carry out testing on time.Drug inspectors deployed from the DDA collect drugs through the random sampling methods and send them for testing in the government’s laboratory. If drugs are found problematic or substandard, the department directs the manufacturing companies concerned to recall those drugs from the market. However, the department does not have an effective mechanism to ensure the recall.In most cases, delays in testing at the laboratory mean that results come in only after all the substandard drugs have been sold in the market.Experts say the use of substandard medicines could adversely affect the patients' health. While thousands of medicines manufactured by national as well as international pharma companies and are being sold from pharmacies across the country, DDA inspectors collect only around 1,000 samples from the market in a year. The inspection work is especially daunting because DDA has just around two dozen drug inspectors tasked with monitoring over 21,000 registered pharmacies and thousands of others unregistered pharmacies.And it takes several months to examine some medicines as the DDA’s laboratory is understaffed with several posts for technicians remaining vacant. The department allows the drug manufacturing companies to supply medicines into the market directly from the factory. "

        "content": "Over 3,000 girls between 14 and 15 years who were given the first dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine did not show up to take the second dose.Due to the low uptake of the second dose, the Ministry of Health and Population has suspended the vaccination programme for now.“We are preparing to send health workers to schools to administer the second dose of the vaccine to girls who got the first dose but did not show up to receive the second dose,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “We know that those who have not yet sought the second dose will not come to hospitals for vaccination.”According to the health ministry’s data, 9,980 girls between 14 and 15 years of age from all seven provinces were jabbed with the first dose of HPV vaccine under a pilot programme, launched in September last year.Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact. The virus causes cervical cancer, which is the second-most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. Hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in Nepal.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.HPV vaccination was also included in the government’s policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2023-24.Doctors say most cervical cancer cases are associated with the HPV, a sexually transmitted infection and that widespread immunisation could reduce the impact of cervical and other cancers caused by the HPV worldwide.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced the HPV vaccine nationally while India and Indonesia have introduced it in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccination in Chitwan and Kaski districts. All girls aged 11 to 13 years were then given two doses of the vaccine.Experts say early treatment prevents up to 80 percent of cervical cancer.Meanwhile, health ministry officials said that a nationwide HPV vaccination drive is likely in the third quarter of 2024. The ministry plans to inoculate around 1.7 million girls between 10 and 14 years with HPV vaccine through nationwide drives, and also make it a part of regular immunisation.According to officials, the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has agreed to provide HPV vaccine doses. They said that once the campaign is completed, the HPV vaccine will be included in the government’s routine immunisation programme.Nepal had submitted a proposal to GAVI in July last year requesting for HPV doses for free so that the vaccine could be included on the regular immunisation list. Ministry officials say they have proposed a budget for nationwide HPV vaccination campaigns in 2024.Officials say that GAVI has already agreed to provide required doses of vaccine, but the problem is their availability. The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.The UN health body says HPV is responsible for more than 70 percent of the cervical cancer cases in women. Countries that have included the HPV vaccine in their regular immunisation list have successfully reduced cervical cancer cases in women, according to doctors.Meanwhile, the health ministry has started the ‘big-catch-up’ campaign throughout the country, aiming to inoculate children under five years who have either missed scheduled doses or have not completed a vaccine series. Under the programme, health workers including female community health volunteers will track children who have not completed all doses of routine vaccines. Every year, the ministry launches a month-long campaign to boost the coverage of routine vaccines.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases such as measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.However, a report of the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months have received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016. "

        "content": "Potato, a staple food of hundreds of thousands of people, especially those residing in the mountainous regions, is among the most widely consumed and versatile crops in Nepal. The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.

        "content": "Chicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. "

        "content": "When Monica Tapia arrived in Nepal, she had a vision: to bring the delights of Mexican cuisine to Kathmandu. Soon after her arrival, she set her plan in motion, selecting a location and crafting a menu with her husband, who shared her passion for cooking and travel. The dream became a reality in February 2017 with the opening of Casa Mexicana in Kathmandu.Despite the difficult task of having to accumulate a whole new culture and language, Tapia enjoyed it. Introducing Mexican cuisine to locals initially proved challenging, yet over time, Casa Mexicana gained momentum.“We realised that people in Nepal are open to trying new things and dishes. There’s a natural hesitation at the beginning, but with time, we found our footing and developed a loyal customer base,” says Tapia. She believes that food can unite people, transcending cultural and language barriers. Nearly seven years since its inception, Casa Mexicana’s kitchen is predominantly staffed by Nepalis, guided by Tapia to capture the essence of Mexican cuisine in Nepal.There were a few challenges due to the availability of some ingredients, leading to the substitution of certain items with Nepali alternatives. Initially, sourcing the right type of corn flour for making corn tortillas was a hurdle, so they started using a different flour. The taste of avocados in Nepal differed from that in Mexico, so the Casa team added new ingredients to achieve an authentic Mexican guacamole. Tapia also had to design her own recipe for Pambazo—a deep fried Mexican sandwich, because they couldn’t find a lot of the ingredients for the recipe in Nepal. Interestingly, zucchini, commonly used in Mexican dishes, was not well-received by Nepali diners.Tapia observed a shared preference between Nepali and Mexican taste buds—both favouring flavourful food over bland options. While both nationalities appreciate spiciness in their meals, it was noted that the spice preference extended beyond just chili-dependent heat.Casa began as a small venture, starting off more as a cafe than a restaurant, but the Gairidhara restaurant has now grown to offer ample space for diverse customers. Upon entering, you’re greeted with warm hospitality, affirming that choosing to dine here was a good decision. The spacious interior unfolds with a gleaming bar straight ahead, and to the right, servers don traditional Mexican attire, part of the Mariachi outfit, complete with sombreros (wide-brimmed Mexican men’s hats). According to the founders, the restaurant aims to provide an authentic Mexican experience, evident in its fabric pattern from the Otomi tribal Mexican group, and décor reminiscent of Mexico. Tapia believes dining at a restaurant is not just about the food; it's also about the experience, and the ambience. Customers can even don sombrero hats casually hanging on the walls for a complete immersion into this Mexican haven. The seating arrangement is thoughtfully designed to cater to various dining preferences—from general dining areas for casual meals to elaborately designed private rooms with fireplaces and long meeting tables, ideal for business dealings.Tapia mentions that Casa's menu reflects typical Mexican restaurants, offering burritos, quesadillas, sopes, pambazo, enchiladas and more, ensuring an authentic Mexican taste. Her personal favourite, the pambazo, is a fried sandwich with a special pepper sauce called Guajillo, served with cheese and a special salsa. Another standout, the sopes, is a corn casserole with beans, featuring fillings like mushroom, rajas paneer, potatoes and tinga mushroom, topped with cream cheese and veggies. During our visit to Casa Mexicana, we opted for the burrito, curious to experience an authentic Mexican version compared to our homemade attempts. The chicken burrito we tried was delightful, packed with beans, cheese, chicken and served with red rice, potatoes and salsa. The burrito offered a well-balanced plate of flavours that was both satisfying and delicious.At Casa, the servers welcome you with a friendly disposition, making you feel comfortable exploring new tastes. Following their suggestion, we tried the ponche, a warm Mexican fruit-based drink brimming with sugarcane, apples and guava, pear, mandarin, and shakkar, to sweeten the ponche. It left us with the belief that tasty dishes can also be healthy. The next dish we ordered was a dessert—Tres Leches; after all, it is what Casa Mexicana does best. This spongy, light cake is topped with a cream made from three different kinds of milk—coconut, condensed, and whole milk. Traditionally, the Tres Leches is made with evaporated milk, but since that's not widely available in Nepal, Tapia replaced it with Coconut milk. It practically melts in the mouth, offering a sweet sensation without being overly intense. Plus, the generous portion size makes it a winner all around.Tapia is optimistic about Casa Mexicana’s future and is currently pleased with the success they’ve achieved in Nepal. While she envisions opening similar restaurants worldwide, she’s content with having found a home in Nepal. There are also plans to introduce more menu items in the future, including more soups best for the winter, and a few more different kinds of Mexican dessert, ensuring that their customers will have even more of the incredibly tasty Tres Leches and other delicious Mexican desserts to enjoy.

        "content": "Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley "

        "content": "Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. "

        "content": "The gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. "

        "content": "Serene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

        "content": "Five young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. "

        "content": "Nepal suffered a 10-run defeat at the hands of West Indies A in the second of the five-match series played at TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, Kathmandu on Sunday. The visitors set a 161-run target for Nepal and restricted them to 150-9.Electing to bat first after winning the toss, West Indies A had a shaky start as they lost openers Johnson Charles and Alick Athanaze early at 11 and six runs respectively.However, Andre Fletcher steadied the innings with a composed knock of 43 runs off 36 deliveries with three sixes before losing his wicket to Dipendra Singh Airee in 17.5 overs. Roston Chase contributed 23 runs as Gudakesh Motie’s blazing innings of 33 runs off just eight balls helped the visitors to set a decent target against the Rhinos.For Nepal, Sagar Dhakal and Kushal Bhurtel took two wickets each in their four-over spell as Sompal Kami and Dipendra Singh Airee grabbed a wicket apiece.In the run chase, Nepal lost opener Kushal Bhurtel for two runs in 3.4 overs. Anil Sah was sent back to the pavilion for one run in 4.4 overs. Opener Lokesh Bam looked promising with his fluent stroke play but failed to convert his start into a substantial score. Bam lost his wicket to Gudakesh Motie for 17 runs in 5.5 overs.Rohit Paudel put in a heroic effort, playing a captain’s innings with an unbeaten 71 off 48 balls. Gulsan Jha’s brief cameo of 25 runs off 11 balls injected some excitement into the crowd. But were restricted to 150-9 on the board at the end of the stipulated 20 overs.For West Indies, Gudakesh Motie and Obed McCoy took two wickets each while Oshane Thomas and Roston Chase took a wicket apiece.With the victory, the visiting team have levelled the five-match series 1-1.With skipper Rohit Paudel’s blistering century, Nepal had defeated West Indies A by four wickets in the first T20 on Saturday.  "

        "content": "Skipper Rohit Paudel scored a blistering century as Nepal defeated West Indies A by four wickets in the first T20 and took a 1-0 lead in the five-match series at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, Kathmandu on Saturday.Paudel smashed 112 runs in his aggressive 54-ball knock that featured 10 fours and six sixes, helping Nepal chase down a big target of 205 runs with two balls to spare.Coach Monty Desai gave the responsibility of opening the batting to Anil Sah in place of regular opener and wicket keeper Aasif Sheikh, who was rested for the opening T20.In February, the 25-year-old Sah had announced his return to international cricket with a fifty and an unbeaten century against Canada during the Nepal-Canada home bilateral ODI series. He also scored an unconquered half-century in Nepal’s nine-wicket thrashing of the Netherlands during the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 the same month.However, Sah has lost his form since, scoring only 42 runs from his last five innings. On Saturday, Sah left the crease in 2.1 overs making just five runs facing nine deliveries, caught by Kadeem Alleyne off Mathhew Forde.Meanwhile, Nepal’s another regular opener Kushal Bhurtel is experiencing the lowest point of his career. He was dismissed for a duck for a three match in a row in Nepal’s forgettable ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup campaign in Oman. Bhurtel is one of the only three Nepali cricketers (alongside Dipendra Singh Airee and Paudel) to have crossed 1000-run mark in men’s T20Is but his dip in form just one month before Nepal’s 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup has raised question whether he would be fit to travel to the West Indies and the United States.Desai, who is now feeling the pressure to reinstall steel in a failing Nepali team ahead of their crucial World Cup tournament, still put faith in Bhurtel but the opener struggled with the bat again, as he returned to the pavilion scoring 16 runs off 12 balls.But Paudel came at number three and showed the world Nepal can emerge from the ashes, shouldering the responsibility and batting all the way to the 19 overs, and steering his team closer to victory.Kushal Malla’s form is also a big concern. His 16 off 15 against the visiting West Indies was his highest individual score in his last four games.In fact, Paudel returned from Oman wearing the tag of the biggest flop after failing to lead the Rhinos to the 2025 Asia Cup and 2024 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup.But, back at home, Paudel showed character and demonstrated his side could learn from mistakes. He added 64 runs with Dipendra for the fourth wicket before Dipendra, one of the consistent batters and the only bright spot of Nepal in the Premier Cup, fell to Keemo Paul in the 15.3 overs.Paudel kept on fighting and reached his century off 47 balls. It was his first hundred in an international (unofficial) T20 match. It will not be recognised by the International Cricket Council though.New batter Bibek Yadav (7) also departed without making significant contribution, before Forde finally undid Paudel in the 18.5 overs.But the skipper had already laid a strong foundation.With Nepal needing 14 runs from the last seven balls, Pratis GC smashed a four off Forde to balance the equation and Gulsan Jha cracked two consecutive boundaries off Oshane Thomas, helping Nepal overhaul the target in style.Forde and Obed McCoy took two wickets each for the West Indies A, while Paul pocketed one.Earlier, West Indies A posted 204-5 from their 20 overs after being invited to bat first, thanks to impressive knocks from captain Roston Chase and Alick Athanaze.The tourists lost their opener Johnson Charles for a duck to Kamal Airee in the first over but Athanaze played a brisk 25-ball 47 and Chase cracked 74 runs from 46 balls to guide their team to a huge total.Keacy Carty was also brilliant as he made 38 off 26 balls and assisted Chase to add 60 runs for the fifth wicket.Andre Fletcher contributed 5-ball 13, while Alleyne added 14 not out off 15 balls for the visitors.Kamal Airee, who was one of the four additions alongside Lokesh Bam, Binod Bhandari, Sagar Dhakal, in the 20-man squad, took a wicket. Dipendra, Rohit Paudel and Abinash Bohara also picked a wicket apiece.Sompal Kami and Karan KC were also benched.The second T20 takes place on Sunday. This tour is the first for a West Indies side in Nepal. "

The series will begin on Saturday.Nepal are hosting a West Indies cricket team for the first time in their history. The matches will take place at TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur.The series will serve as a preparatory tournament for Nepal’s upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to be held in the West Indies and the United States in June.Nepal coach Monty Desai has called up the same squad that failed to live up to their billing in Al Amerat, Oman during the recently concluded ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup. Nepal failed to defend their trophy they won in 2023—which was a one-day international tournament—and could not qualify for the 2025 Asia Cup after losing to the eventual champions United Arab Emirates in the semi-finals by six wickets.Nepal also missed out on the 2024 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup after losing their third-place playoff match against Hong Kong by four wickets.However, the squad includes two newcomers in Aarif Sheikh and Aakash Chand. Aarif was an important member of the Nepal A team who played two series against Ireland Wolves earlier this month in Kathmandu. Sheikh had scored 49 (26) and 93 not out (48) against the visiting Ireland team in the first and third T20. Ireland Wolves won the three-match T20 series 2-1.Aarif was also a member of Nepal A’s squad that played three-match one-day series against Ireland Wolves. He was dropped in the third one-day after he was dismissed for a duck in the first and second one-day games.Bowler Chand did not play any part in the Ireland Wolves tour of Nepal. But he travelled with the senior men’s cricket team to take part in Hong Kong T20I Series in Mong Kong, where he took seven wickets in his three innings.Chand rose to limelight in January when his five-wicket haul against Afghanistan U-19 helped Nepal U-19 produce a rare one-wicket win and qualify for Super Six stage of the ICC U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup.Nepal have faced off against a West Indies team only once before, during the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe in June last year.

Many in the West have already understood this. Alas, not everyone.”In response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, the United States and its allies prohibited transactions with Russia’s central bank and finance ministry and blocked about $300 billion of sovereign Russian assets in the West, most of which are in European not American financial institutions.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a separate comment that there was still a lot of Western money in Russia which could be targeted by Moscow’s counter-measures.“The prospects for legal challenges (against the confiscation of Russian assets) will be wide open,” he said. “Russia will take advantage of those and will endlessly defend its interests.” "

We have an obligation to pilot, to lead this process (of reparations)”, the president told reporters on Saturday.Portugal’s colonial era lasted more than five centuries, with Angola, Mozambique, Brazil, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, East Timor and some territories in Asia subject to Portuguese rule.Decolonisation of the African countries and the end of empire in Africa only happened months after Portugal’s “Carnation Revolution” on April 25, 1974, toppled the longest fascist dictatorship in Europe and ushered in democracy.

When the tents were not removed, police arrested and transported protesters to the Monroe County Justice Center on charges of criminal trespass and resisting arrest.“The Indiana University Police Department continues to support peaceful protests on campus that follow university policy,” the police statement read.Pro-Palestinian protests have spread to college campuses across the US, stoked by the mass arrest of over 100 people on Columbia University’s campus last week.In addition to a ceasefire, protesters are demanding that their schools divest from companies involved with Israel's military and seeking an end to US military assistance for Israel along with amnesty for students and faculty members who have been disciplined or fired for protesting.School leaders at several universities have responded in the past week by asking police to clear out camps and arrest those who refuse to leave. While saying they defend free speech rights to protest, the leaders say they will not abide activists infringing on campus policies against hate speech or camping out on university grounds.Massachusetts State Police said in statement that they helped cleared out a protest encampment at Northeastern University in Boston and that 102 protesters who refused to leave were arrested and will be charged with trespassing.Northeastern University said in a statement on social media that it decided to call in police as “what began as a student demonstration two days ago was infiltrated by professional organizers with no affiliation to Northeastern.”At Arizona State University, campus police arrested 69 protesters early Saturday, the school said in a statement.The university said “a group of people – most of whom were not ASU students, faculty or staff – created an encampment and demonstration” and were arrested and charged with criminal trespass after refusing to disperse.

The rallies also followed a mass stabbing in Sydney this month that killed six people, including five women.Protesters demanding stronger criminal laws gathered in Sydney, capital of New South Wales state, for a rally and then a march that closed city streets. Some protesters carried signs that read “Respect” and “No More Violence”.In South Australia’s capital Adelaide, it was estimated around 3,000 people rallied at the city's parliament building.Prime Minister Albanese said he would be part of a rally in the national capital Canberra on Sunday.“I will walk with women across Australia to say enough is enough,” Albanese said on social media platform X.“Violence against women is an epidemic. We must do better.”In Adelaide, Greens Party Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said “a national emergency response” was needed to tackle the issue.“Women are sick and tired of being told ‘yes it’s bad but there’s not much we can do,” Hanson-Young said, according to a spokesperson.Similar protests were scheduled across the weekend in state capitals Perth, Western Australia; Melbourne, Victoria; Hobart, Tasmania; and Brisbane, Queensland.Gender-based violence is an ongoing issue in Australia, a nation of 26 million. In 2021, tens of thousands rallied over allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct in some of the nation’s highest political offices. "

        "content": "Nepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

        "content": "Bharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

        "content": "Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  "

        "content": "The diamond jubilee of the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) has brought out an interesting mix of history, ideology and interpretations. The party, founded in 1949, was a monolith organisation of the Nepali communists. Over the years, its history has covered all forms and variations. I consider that a remarkable phenomenon in Nepal’s political history. The foundation and evolution of the CPN had direct guidance from the Communist Party of India, founded in 1925; the CPI (Marxist) that split from it in 1964 did have an important influence on the foundational history of the communist party of Nepal. This is not the subject of this article. Major political parties, both the communists and the social democratic groups, became operational in Nepali rajniti in the middle of the last century. To mention two important dates, the CPN was founded under the leadership of Pushpa Lal Shrestha in 1949, and the Nepali Congress was established under the leadership of BP Koirala in 1950. However, the communists split into many factions. The bigger and smaller factions articulate a call for unity and the desire to return to a monolith communist party of Nepal. Perhaps such an operational continuum has become a feature of the communist organisations in Nepal. This call has entered a new major post-political phase this year, which was seen at the diamond jubilee of the foundation of the Communist Prty on April 22, 2024. A decisive approach comes from UML chairperson KP Sharma Oliʼs political paper presented on April 20, in which he rules out the call for communist unity as an immediate need. As reported by the Kathmandu Post, “The chief of the country's largest communist force says that left unity or polarisation is impractical as well as unnecessary”. The gathering of the major leaders of the communist groups of Nepal, also attended by Sher Bahadur Deuba, president of the Nepali Congress, was theatrical. A unique psyche of performance and ideology was dramatised on the occasion. The histories of these parties and their internal changes have become a commonplace subject in books of history and political studies. Native and foreign interpreters have been writing on this subject. Ideological shifts, crises and confusions have continued to draw the interest of mavericks like us who use the above themes in post-political culture studies and the role of agencies and social changes in some academic exercises and cultural studies. The binary of the Nepali Congress and the Nepali communists, organised under several nomenclatures, is no longer the reality. But the communists’ attempts to come together again are being interpreted variously. Journalist and columnist Rajaram Gautam has interpreted the present predicament of the Nepali communists as what he calls kanatabijok or a very miserable state (Kantipur, April 22, 2024). A certain sense of disillusionment and some scepticism, not least about a natural process of evolution of party and ideology, has become the topic of discussion. But we should look at the pervasive influence of the communist ideology in Nepali politics at different levels. King Mahendra's takeover of power by dissolving the people's elected parliament and locking up prime minister, ministers and leaders of all political parties in 1960 became a turning point in Nepali history. Not much is written about the king’s mind. Naturally, his actions and dictatorial modus operandi dominated the majority of discussions. BP Koirala is the only politician or writer who has written about the psyche of the king, though briefly, in his diary entries and short discourses. The king banned the parties but continued to show his interest in the style and operational mode of the communist party. His liking for the methods of the communists can be seen in his actions. He became very interested in turning the Nepali communists to his side. Nepali communist leader Kesharjung Rayamajhi's support of the king's dissolution of the parliament as a “progressive step” in 1960 is a case in point. King Mahendra used the style of the communists, especially that of the Chinese communist party and its chairman Mao Zedong. He emulated the style used during the Chinese Cultural Revolution to launch the “Back to the Village” campaign. A small red book with quotations from his ideas and that of the Panchayat ideology was circulated nationwide like the “red book” disseminated during the revolution. King Mahendra was a Hindu monarch who liked any aggrandisement that came with that. But he did not take up the cudgel to project himself as a great Hindu monarch. Instead, he projected an image like that of an all-controlling communist leader spreading his ideologies. I don't know how much of this side of the king is discussed by analysts, but I have not come across any convincing psycho-political study of King Mahendra's temptation to use the communist methodology, ironically, by maintaining the ban on the communists and the Nepali Congress. The king's successors used “inter-party and intra-elite conflicts once again” to “nurture the monarchical ambition to be fully absolute.” (Lok Raj Baral, The Kathmandu Post, April 21, 2024).The diamond jubilee of the Communist Party, split into several communist parties, did present an occasion for review, but not of any systematic and pragmatic order. As far as I could understand, the diamond jubilee did not evoke any specific history. The Communist Party documents are more the records of the seminars, plenums and resolutions passed at the end rather than systematic compendiums of them. One remarkable oeuvre running 780 pages is titled Nepali Communist Andolan ra Janakrantika Atihasik Dastabejharu-Part 1 (2071 BS). A statement in the report of the then general secretary Pushpa Kamal Dahal presented at the central committee meeting of the Mashal group in 2045 speaks volumes. It says, “As the Jhapa minority group…has adopted a method of election, their claims about the armed struggle does not have any meaning and validity.” However, Lokendra Bista, the organiser of this volume, says it presents important communist history anyway. I would mention Puspalalka Chhanieka Rachana (2016) or \"Selected Writings\" as one important communist ideological document. The Maoists have produced some ideological documents. But I think it is time for independent scholars to shun the stereotypes of communist party arguments and engage seriously and openly about the origin, spread and academic significance of the communist documents and history.  "

        "content": "Two weeks ago I got a phone call from a friend I first met in the early 1990s. He told me he was applying to a PhD program at one of the universities in Nepal. He further said the university required its PhD applicants to have published two research articles as part of its eligibility requirements. The friend had written an article to meet this requirement and asked me to quickly read it to see if it would make the “cut” in one of the journals I edit. After reading his article, I told him that it was not good enough for the journal since, at under 2500 words, it was too short in length and shallow in its analysis (meaning, it would be “desk rejected” if submitted formally).This encounter got me thinking. In the Fall of 1987, as a senior student in college, I applied to some of the best economics PhD programs in the USA. My major in college was economics, but I had taken quite a few maths courses. My GPA was good and I assume that my college teachers wrote decent recommendations for me. Based on these credentials, I hoped to get into one of the better PhD programs (although I was already having doubts about pursuing economics as an intellectual vocation). While several universities turned me down, my application was accepted by several good economics PhD programs, including the one at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), where I enrolled. None of the 10 universities I had applied to then said I needed to have published research articles to be eligible to apply. If there had been such a requirement, my application would have been disqualified immediately since I had not done much original research in economics while in college, let alone publish anything related. Later when I abandoned the study of economics and began to pursue a PhD in history at UPenn, the new department also did not say that this was a requirement to approve my internal transfer.So what exactly is the point of this eligibility requirement—two research articles published before you can join a PhD program—for potential applicants? As we all know, universities require that applicants submit all kinds of documents as part of their applications. These would include transcripts which detail the courses they have taken and the grades obtained in previous BA and MA level studies; scores from standardised tests (such as GREs) when appropriate; recommendation letters; personal statements regarding why they want to pursue a particular doctoral program given their previous academic and work backgrounds; and in some cases, a writing sample and (especially in European universities), a proposal for the doctoral research you want to do. The last requirement is usually not in the PhD programs with a long coursework component. These days, some programs also interview shortlisted applicants.All of these documents (and the interview) provide various signals and help in an overall assessment of any applicant’s suitability for the concerned PhD program, namely, figuring out whether or not he or she is ready for a multiple-year research odyssey. Perhaps, some universities, including the one my friend is applying to, think that the already published research articles provide stronger signals than all of the other documents I have mentioned above. If so, that university and others with similar requirements are mistaken regarding the primary mission of their PhD programs. The main mission of any PhD programme in any discipline ought to be that those students who enroll in it learn to become researchers during their studies. This process would entail learning to read what other people have written on various themes of the particular discipline’s concern, identifying a knowledge gap, designing a research project to fill that gap, executing the research using credible methods, and writing the dissertation. The student joining a PhD program shouldn’t be expected to know all of these things prior to their doctoral training. The whole point of the PhD training – spanned over several years—is to learn to do all of the above at a fairly good competence level through recursive efforts under the supervision of relatively senior scholars in your field. Yes, applicants need to demonstrate—through their entire application package—that they are capable of joining the research adventure. However, the other documents submitted as part of the application process should be enough for such an evaluation.If you agree with the way in which I have characterised the primary mission of any PhD programme, then you would certainly agree that from the point of view of the potential applicants, institutionalising the need for already published research articles as part of their application works as a barrier to entry. The universities in Nepal that have this requirement are not welcoming places for potential PhD students hoping to be nurtured through the doctoral training process. Instead, this requirement signals that the very start of their PhD programmes—the applicant selection process—suffers from a bureaucratic mindset about which I have written previously (“Structural Ills of Our Universities”, 20 January 2023). There is more to my friend’s story. He already has a bachelor’s degree in his field of work and a master’s degree in a related field. He has more than 32 years of work experiences that encompass ground-level hands-on work to top-level managerial positions in various projects. In all these years of working in different capacities, he has amassed a vast amount of knowledge about his field. In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that he is one of the most knowledgeable persons about his field. But as far as I know, he has never claimed to work as an academic researcher and that should not be a disqualification if he now wants to become a PhD aspirant. Quite the contrary, the university in question should welcome him with open arms. If I were the admissions dean of the school in which my friend’s proposed PhD program is located, I would have told him to just write a long personal statement explaining why he wants to do a PhD at an age when some of our mutual friends are thinking about retirement and what he wants to do subsequently with that training. If my university was also one that espoused industry-academia collaboration, I would have considered his application to fit this rubric perfectly. This would be so since the point of such a collaboration is not to invent a technology all the time that can be marketed but to bring the considerable knowledge possessed by industry insiders (like my friend) and give them academic space to articulate that knowledge. Our universities are champions of stupid mantras but are rather slow in providing such flexibility. Without flexibility, PhD programs cannot be inclusive in the more expansive sense of the word.But is anyone who gatekeeps the admission process in Nepali universities actually reading this? The second installment of this column will be published next fortnight. "

        "content": "Masala, or a mixture of spices, has been part of our daily food since time immemorial, and it’s hard to imagine lip-smacking, savoury food without them. Among the many brands available, Indian products like MDH and Everest are popular in Nepali kitchens. Unfortunately, some of these so-called “kitchen kings” (MDH’s Madras Curry Powder, Sambhar Masala Mixed Masala Powder, Curry Powder Mix Masala Powder and Everest’s Fish Curry Masala) have recently been banned in Hong Kong and Singapore. They have been found contaminated with harmful ethylene oxide (a carcinogenic pesticide) exceeding permissible limits. The presence of carcinogenic in these spices is “unsuitable for human health”, as exposure to it can lead to lymphoma, leukaemia and stomach and breast cancers.This discovery has upset MDH and Everest masala lovers worldwide, including in India, the largest producer, consumer and exporter of these spices. In response, the country is investigating the underlying cause of the ban, and the Indian food security regulator has ordered a quality check of these products. According to reports, however, the United States Food and Drug Administration found Salmonella, a bacteria that causes diarrhoea, in Everest’s spice mixes in 2023.Nepal’s Food Technology and Quality Control Department has also pledged to test the masala brands. But Nepal seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach, while Hong Kong and Singapore have already restricted their use. In the recent Post report, the food authority said, “Countries have their own acceptable limits of pesticide use, and if these masala products are found crossing limits set by the department, it will direct authorities concerned to recall the products from the market.” This doesn’t sound convincing enough as the products sold in those countries are available in Nepal too. One wonders what’s stopping our authorities from following their path.During high-demand times like Dashain and Tihar, not only are these spices consumed in large quantities, but they are also mixed with other substances. Several food manufacturing companies bring high-adulterated products that harm people’s health. Pesticides are rife in fruits and vegetables found in markets. Yet Nepal lacks robust food-standard surveillance and regulatory mechanisms. In February this year, the Agriculture, Cooperatives and Natural Resources Committee of the House of Representatives passed a bill on food purity and quality with strict penalties for manufacturing of adulterated and low-quality foods. The bill, however, will not be of much use if the number of food testing labs and inspectors who can investigate the matter are not increased, as experts suggest. Now is the time to push for public health and safety by taking proactive measures. As the consumer rights activists have pointed out, Nepal should follow in the footsteps of Hong Kong and Singapore and recall tainted spices from the market before it is too late. People should also be made aware of the health risks associated with these spices and taught proper food-handling practices. This can also be an opportunity to push local masala producers to bring out quality products—or face the consequences. Manufacturers are responsible for ensuring quality of their products and adhering to international food standards and norms. What we need. A safer food system that prioritises the well-being of consumers is the need of the hour.  "

        "category": "editorial",
        "content": "The Nepali state’s campaign to abolish chhaupadi—observing forced isolation during menstruation—has suffered from indifference and lethargy, leading to the return of the chhau sheds. When local-level governments took the lead to demolish chhau sheds four years ago after the death of Parvati Budha due to snakebite, it was hoped that the hinterlands, primarily in Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces, would be free of chhau sheds. However, with the campaign losing steam, the sheds have started to pop up once again. And with this, there are fears that menstruating women will continue to die in the sheds as they have been dying for generations. The chhau sheds are notorious for the deaths of women from cold, suffocation, snakebites and wildlife attacks. The women also face physical violence and sexual harassment when in isolation. Apart from deaths, women also face psychological stress from having to stay isolated in cramped, damp sheds for days at a stretch. The chhau sheds, therefore, are the spaces of dehumanisation of women and have no place in a civilised society. But as the return of the sheds has shown, doing away with superstition is easier said than done. A study by the Nepal Government 2010 showed that 19 percent of Nepali women practice chhaupadi, with the figure reaching as high as 50 percent in the Karnali and Sudurpaschim regions. The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005, and in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But these legal provisions have failed to stop the practice. As per reports, the women are allowed to stay in their homes during their menstruation only when monitoring teams are in the villages. On other occasions, the women are forced by the family to live in the sheds. What’s more, the families are not even aware of the legal provisions disallowing the practice of chhaupadi. But this provision also has a problem: The women falling victim to the system cannot file a legal complaint against their family members. In rare cases when the women gather the courage to go against their families, they do not find social and legal support to continue their fight. The fact that families are willing to sacrifice their members in the name of tradition shows that our campaigns to educate the people about the ills of chhaupadi are inadequate. Legal provisions are hardly enough to stop a practice rooted in cultural beliefs. Apart from the law, education on the need to do away with this archaic practice is of utmost importance. In the absence of solid educational campaigns, the enthusiasm to change an old practice, however dangerous, dies down. The government must, therefore, in coordination with local levels, invest massively in educational campaigns across the region. Chhaupadi is a practice that goes against universal human rights, and the government should be ruthless in abolishing it not just legally but socially and culturally as well.  "

        "content": "It’s the season of inferno all over again. Almost everywhere in the country, you see amber and smoke in forests and grasslands. These fires are not “wild” per se, as most of them have been deliberately started by unscrupulous people with little concern for the environment or the society at large. And, as expected, the wildfires have entered villages, turning homes and sheds into ash and killing people and animals alike.The National Disaster Risk Reduction Portal of the Government of Nepal has said 14 people were killed, 49 injured, and 1,132 families affected in fire incidents in the past month alone. But more than numbers, they represent the high cost of our neglect and lack of preparedness. What is more distressing is that fire incidents are an annual occurrence and we continue to maintain the same lackadaisical attitude we had adopted last year and the years before. Last year, 112 people were killed, 506 injured, and 5,328 families affected in such fire incidents.History repeats itself tragically each year, killing people and animals and destroying property and environment, and it is as if we are doomed to repeat old mistakes. It’s an age-old general knowledge that the dry season comes with the risk of wildfires. Scientists say it is sometimes possible for wildfires to start on their own, but most of the time, they are mediated by human activity. Coupled with the propensity of the wild to catch fire during drought is the pseudo-scientific notion among the people that burning stubble makes the land more fertile, paving the way for better-quality grass or crops. It is this dangerous mix of the natural and the human factors that makes late spring and early summer a season of fires.In being reluctant to mend our ways, we are subjecting ourselves to the vicious cycle of death and destruction each year—a travesty of civilisation indeed. The sheer scale of fire this season is rendering responders helpless, as they have neither the human resources nor equipment to deal with the crisis. Therefore, the best way out is to find ways to stop the generation of wildfires in the first place. And for this, the government must begin a massive awareness campaign at the community level against the use of wildfires for generating so-called organic fertiliser.There are in fact legal provisions in place to punish those who start wildfires. Outside protected areas of forests, the prevailing Forest Act provisions for a fine of Rs 60,000 and or three years of jail, in addition to covering the losses. These are big penalties, yet also meaningless if they cannot be enforced. With years of experience in dousing wildfires—or the lack thereof—the government is well aware of the high-risk zones for wildfires. It should work with local levels to prevent, monitor and respond to wildfires in such localities. Additionally, there should be more investment in firefighting resources. Finally, preventing wildfires is not the prerogative of one ministry or department, as beyond human cost it also imposes social and environmental costs. So what is needed is a multi-dimensional, multi-pronged approach that brings together various stakeholders to make wildfires a rarity. "

        "content": "Nepal’s unitary politics was badly ridden with anomalies. The same can be said about its provincial politics under a federal system today. Political parties and leaders, who endlessly bicker over power sharing, have now started involving province heads and speakers in their plans to unconstitutionally grab power. The emergence of repeated controversies involving speakers and province heads is concerning as the holders of these two positions are expected to play neutral roles in provincial assemblies and governments. The federal system cannot function if province speakers and province heads act as no more than stooges of politicians at the centre. Cases accusing provincial speakers and province heads of the breach of the constitution are queuing up in the Supreme Court. They are accused of violating the constitution to help leaders from the political parties close to them to form governments. On Sunday, Laxman Kishore Chaudhary of Nagarik Unmukti Party moved the apex court to challenge the appointment of Dirgha Sodari as Sudurpaschim chief minister. Chaudhary accused Province Head Najir Miya of preventing him from becoming chief minister despite him having a clear majority in his favour. A petition against the formation of the Khagaraj Adhikari-led government in Gandaki Province was filed at the top court earlier this month. The case is sub-judice too. Last year, the role of Speaker in Koshi Province was questioned in the course of forming the Uddhav Thapa-led government. It was challenged in the Supreme Court, which eventually adjudicated the speaker’s involvement as unconstitutional, as the Speaker was involved in the voting process to put together a majority in favour of Thapa of the Nepali Congress. The then CPN-UML challenged the act in the top court. This year, the UML resorted to similar tactics and Congress moved the court against that. The province, as a result, is headed for another bout of constitutional complications. These are representative cases. Similar controversies were seen even in previous years.No doubt the Supreme Court is the final interpreter of the constitution. While the judiciary’s involvement should be rare and the last resort to arbitrate political issues, Nepal’s court has been routinely invited to settle them. And the politicians often deride the judiciary when the verdicts don’t favour them. The federal government appoints provincial heads. It might seem normal for the federal government to place its representative in the provinces in order to ensure a level of harmony between the two tiers of government. Yet trying to use them as the henchmen of top politicians at the centre is a grave betrayal of the new constitution. The constitution envisions provincial heads and speakers as neutral positions. The province heads work in a way the President functions at the centre. The constitution has entrusted them with other vital roles as well. It states that in case there is no provincial executive because of the enforcement of federal governance, the provincial head shall exercise the executive power of the province as directed by the federal government. It is the first duty of the province heads and speakers to work as key officials of the state agencies, not as leaders’ yesmen. In order to preserve their sanctity, they should refuse to be top politicians’ partners in crimes. Only if the respective federal actors honestly act out their roles will the system function and the provinces thrive.  "

        "content": "The third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit starts today. At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal. "

        "content": "Political parties’ unhealthy activities to form provincial governments has taken the form of an ugly competition and increased the public’s frustration with the provinces. Separately, leaders of major political parties have started to blame the mixed electoral system for Nepal’s perpetual instability. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to political analyst Tula Narayan Shah to discuss these and other related issues.Nepali politics has entered yet another phase of endless bickering over power after the March 4 change of the ruling coalition. Politicians have resorted to every possible tactic to get leadership in provincial governments. How do you analyse this trend?I am not surprised. It is natural in the kind of parliamentary system that we practise. We adopted the parliamentary model in federal and provincial levels while the one at our local level is similar to the presidential system. Local unit chiefs and deputies are elected directly by the people and they can serve five-year terms. That has ensured stability there. Provincial governments on the other hand are destabilised when there is any change at the centre.Leaders have started blaming the electoral system for hung parliaments and instability. Is the problem in the system or with our leaders?Some senior leaders in major parties now blame the electoral system. Even the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Office of the Auditor General have recommended changes in the electoral model, arguing that the current one had promoted corruption in the country. I am not convinced. Politicians argue that no political party could garner a majority in this system and that led to instability. I rather hold politicians’ personal ambition and corrupt political culture responsible. General secretary of a major political party recently argued that it will be better for national politics to be driven by two political parties. Nepal conducted eight general elections (in 1959, in 1991, in 1994, in 1999, in 2008, in 2013, in 2017 and in 2022) under a multi-party system. Forget the 1959 polls. Of the three polls held in the 1990s, the Nepali Congress got majority in 1991 and 1999. Also, during those years, two parties—the Congress and the CPN-UML—dominated Nepali politics. Did a single-party majority and dominance of two parties provide stability? Not at all. Rather, personal rivalries of the Congress leaders invited instability. Fast forward to 2017 elections. The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance and jointly fought elections. They later merged to form the Nepal Communist Party, which had a comfortable majority. Again the rivalry of the top leaders within the party caused instability. These instances show that a majority for a single party doesn’t necessarily translate into stability.I rather see a conspiracy behind blaming the electoral system. In the 1990s, Nepal adopted the first-past-the-post system to elect all lawmakers. Around 70 percent national seats were controlled by two castes—Brahmin and Chhetri. In 2008, we adopted a mixed electoral system, which was a demand of the 2006 people’s movement, the Maoist insurgency and the Madhesh agitation. The proportional representation category significantly increased representation of women, dalits, Madheshi and indigenous communities in the legislature, whereas the representation of the males of Khas-Arya groups, who were historically ruling the country, decreased drastically.Who are those elected the most under the FPTP system?The FPTP electoral system has certain attributes that are more conducive to some groups than others. ‘High-caste males’ win more elections. Females have less of a chance. But dalits also have less chance even if the candidate is male. Those like contractors, landlords and businesspeople who can freely spend win elections. Likewise, those who are well-connected with the power centres in Kathmandu can influence elections. Chhetris and Thakuris were dominant in Panchayat politics. Brahmins got stronger after the 1990 political change. Also those who have access and visibility in media and other public forums have better chances of being elected under the FPTP.Some leaders who have these capabilities have won elections in different systems. There is one Madheshi leader, who won election in Panchayat, got tickets from Congress and won again in the multiparty system. Later he joined a Madhesh-based party and won. So, high-caste males and those with access to power corridors in Kathmandu want FPTP. Whereas, women, dalits and those from marginalised communities prefer PR.A general perception is that those who are directly elected are competent ones and can deliver whereas those from the PR category are there just for the sake of representation. Do you agree?Leaders didn’t pick the candidates properly under the PR category. They picked their loved or loyal ones or sold these seats for hefty monetary returns. Leaders from Madheshi and indigenous communities fought for this system. But the same Madheshi leaders kept the names of their wives, daughters and other family members at the top of the PR list. Thus leaders misused and defamed the electoral system. So, the debate should be focused on correcting the wrong practices, not scrapping the system itself.Provinces replicated all the wrong practices of the centre and did even worse.We adopted the same parliamentary system in provinces. So the same thing happened there. Conversely, local units are different as the system there is different. Therefore, we have to go for directly elected executive heads at the centre as well as provinces. Let’s elect the prime minister and chief ministers directly. That will give us stability. Senior leaders from the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre have proposed changing the electoral system but they haven’t proposed direct election of the prime minister and chief ministers. So, the solution is direct election of executive heads, as in Palikas. Scrapping of the PR system won’t help.What if a wrong person gets elected to the post and can’t be removed for five years?In a democracy, you have to trust the people. Nepali citizens are the ones who removed monarchy. Can’t they unseat a leader elected by their votes? In a direct election, even a person from outside the political parties may emerge. So, politicians are afraid because traditionally they exert control over candidacy and various other things through the parties. Many think of provinces as an unnecessary burden on state coffers. Is that the case?I don’t think so. State restructuring was one of the major demands of the Maoist insurgency, Madhesh movement and the 2006 People’s Movement. Why did they ask for it? Because Nepal was a heavily centralised state and it wasn’t inclusive. Federalisation of the state, inclusive electoral system and reservation quotas in civil service were the three components of state restructuring.But why did the provinces then fail to deliver and win public trust?The stakeholders spent around a decade deciding what type of provinces should be carved out. Even pro-federalists didn’t debate how to make the provinces functional. Those who lobbied in favour of the federal system have now become defensive. Some are silent. The political party [which is led by Upendra Yadav] that fought for the federal system has been leading the government in Madhesh for the past six years. But they haven’t given any relief to the common people through the provincial government. People have an impression that the provincial system has added corruption and it is only for the leaders and their cronies, not the common people.Are the leaders really corrupt or do they lack efficiency?Even the Maoist and Madheshi parties that promised to be different to the Congress and the UML couldn’t come up with a roadmap to make the federal system and state agencies more meaningful for the people. They only indulged in power politics, just like other parties. That frustrated the people.You recently travelled to various parts of Madhesh province. How are the sub-national administrations working and what is the public mood there?A society where people are aware, educated and active helps make leaders as well as administration accountable. Authorities are found to be working arbitrarily in the places where people can’t question their wrongdoing. We find relatively better administration in the mid-hill regions, where Brahmins and Chhetris have dominant presence as they have better understanding of the system, laws and other information. Such a mid-hill area expands from the eastern border to Lumbini Province. In this belt, people can raise questions and make the administration accountable. Women’s status is better while caste-based discrimination is less. Local units, schools, health posts, and administrative units work well. Conversely, these aspects are weak in Karnali, Sudurpaschim, inner Madhesh and in the northern belt as there is no critical mass capable of questioning the authorities.You should understand that there are two Madhesh belts. One is along the East-West Highway, second is the bordering area. The belt along the highway has a diverse social composition. There is dominance of the people who migrated from the hills. Development indicators are better and so is the presence of state agencies. The more you move south, the more you find homogenous populations of Madheshi origin. Traditional power relations haven’t changed there. Patron-client dynamics still stand. Certain individuals have key roles in elections and other important activities. They take the decision on behalf of other common people. We find similar practice in the northern belt as well but not in the mid-hill and highway areas.Many say local units perform better than provinces. What is the perception on the ground?Local level is equipped with needed authority. Provinces should be given powers to make them effective as per the spirit of federalism. The present system was designed by reluctant federalists. Therefore, what we need is a fresh debate on the reforms of provinces. There are two conflicting claims. A section of the society says provinces have misused their authority and failed to deliver. Others say the provinces need more authority for effective functioning.It is true that provinces have failed to use the authority they have. Provinces have their legislatures that prepare their budgets and their governments can implement it. Give me an example of an exemplary and innovative initiative taken by any of the seven provinces in the past six years. Madhesh Province started the ‘Beti Padhau Beti Bachau’ campaign but corruption doomed it. People started raising questions, “why do we need provinces, if the leaders there are to copy the same corrupt activities of the centre?”Madheshi leaders opposed the hill people’s dominance and discriminatory practices in the central administration. But the same Madheshi leaders aren’t promoting an inclusive system in Madhesh. Around 20 percent of the total Madhesh population are dalits. The government in the province has changed multiple times. But how many dalits have been ministers in the provincial Cabinets? There are 136 local units in Madhesh Province. But only one mayor and two deputy-mayors are from the dalit community. Just like a set of elite people has captured Kathmandu’s politics, another set of elites has captured the politics of Janakpur.How do Madheshi people look at provinces?People in Kathmandu, mid-hills, and some other places can be heard saying provinces should be scrapped. Common people in Madhesh don’t say so. But they have dissatisfaction with the parties who championed the federal system. They say, “our lives are the same even in the federal system”.How do you analyse the performance of two new parties in Madhesh—Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti?Overall, three parties emerged from the 2022 elections. The Rastriya Swatantra Party emerged from the areas with a dominant presence of hill people. The Janamat Party won from eastern Tarai and the Nagarik Unmukti Party from the western part of the southern belt. The Janamat says the agenda of discrimination against Madhesh is still relevant but they oppose the leadership of the Janata Samajbadi Party and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The old Madheshi parties spoke against Kathmandu’s discrimination but they themselves didn’t work to remove discrimination when they led the government in Madhesh. Besides, they didn’t speak against bad governance. Now, the Janamat’s agenda is to fight discrimination and bad governance, both by Kathmandu as well as the old Madheshi parties.The RSP’s emergence is against “the bad governance of the Congress and the UML”. Its major agenda is good governance. It doesn’t care about discrimination. But bad governance isn’t an agenda of Nagarik Unmukti. The party that emerged mainly after the Tikapur incident is against the discrimination of Tharu community. The dispute in the party is family-based and the outfit hasn’t taken the form of a political party. "

        "content": "Of late, Nepali Congress leaders have publicly emphasised the need for a change in the current mixed electoral system to ensure political stability in the country. They argue that the two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—should now join hands to reform this system. The UML leaders haven’t opposed the idea. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to former chief election commissioner Neel Kantha Uprety on such proposed reforms of the country’s electoral system. Of late, leaders of the Congress have been blaming the mixed electoral system for producing hung parliaments and thus resulting in political instability. Has time come to revisit our election system?Any electoral system cannot be faulty in and of itself. Its success depends on its users. There is no ready-made electoral system perfect for a particular country. Also, there are no textbook models we can instantly employ. You must factor in fundamental realities of a society while picking and implementing an election system. Voters’ education level and experience, the country’s economic parameters, its social composition mainly of ethnic communities and also the geography are to be considered while coming up with an electoral modality. We have to create a strong foundation and lay the ground to put that design into practice. The role of actors is vital in this process. Our election system has evolved in the past seven decades. We introduced the multiparty election system in our first parliamentary election in 1959. We, however, had practised electing representatives through voting in different forms even before that. In 1959, we imported the multiparty election system from India. It arrived in our neighbouring country from the United Kingdom during the colonial period. We practised the same electoral system in three multiparty democratic elections after the restoration of democracy in 1990. We imported the system as it was, without modifying it to suit our reality. It was only after the success of the 2006 People’s Movement that people strongly demanded that the electoral system be reformed to ensure representation of historically underrepresented sections of society. Inclusion was a demand of the movement. In the elections previous to that we had failed to ensure candidacy, election and representation of women, and those from marginalised and backwarded groups and communities. Then the issue of ensuring election of diverse communities to the Constituent Assembly and their participation in the constitution making process became a major agenda. The election of the first CA had to be postponed multiple times due to major parties’ differences over electoral provisions. Eventually, all sides agreed to adopt a mixed electoral modality consisting of the first-past-the-post (FPTP) and the proportional representation (PR). It was introduced in the first CA polls. Women and various historically underrepresented groups made it to the CA. It was in fact a leap forward in representation. Only the FPTP electoral system wouldn’t have created this inclusive picture. So, the credit for the present inclusive representation goes to the PR system. But our leaders have tried to shift the blame for political instability to the electoral system. When it comes to the question of whether time is ripe to revisit the electoral system, we should remember that we adopted this system in the course of post-conflict management. Some countries have employed multiple electoral systems successfully. Take South Africa. After the end of apartheid in early 1990s, it adopted a fully proportional representation electoral model. The system has helped them manage the conflict properly. It has given them majority governments. Conversely, in our case, political parties and leaders misused our mixed system. If it is to be revisited, let’s do it in a way that would remove anomalies seen in the mixed system. We should mainly have a provision that bars actors’ [leaders’] manipulation of the system.What anomalies of the mixed electoral system have been seen in the past four elections and how can we remove them?There were electoral anomalies in previous systems as well. But at the time we were happy that the country had democracy and we didn’t bother about other things. In the new system, leaders misused the seats allocated under the PR category. They used it against its spirit of ensuring proportional representation of all communities and groups. Powerful leaders used this system to promote their family members, those loyal to them and even sold the seats to well-off people. Moreover, they put the names of their close ones on top of the list to boost their election chances. How successful has the system been in ensuring representation of historically marginalised groups?It has succeeded to an extent. For example, women have been elected in around one-third of the total seats in federal parliament. The representation in local units is even better. However, their representation is weaker when it comes to the decision making positions. Dalits representation has increased but it is still not in proportion to their population. This is also so for other marginalised communities. It became possible only after the mandatory legal provisions.Political leaders have manipulated the system to promote their closed ones to positions even under women, Dalit and other categories. Is it due to legal loopholes? Can a law completely stop leaders from doing so?No law can ensure that. It is because of the leaders’ bad intent, which cannot be mended. We have to find a solution from within the system.What will such a solution look like?No system or law will work unless the political parties, candidates and voters correct themselves. Many prefer the FPTP system as under it unscrupulous candidates can buy candidacy as well as voters and win elections. Rich candidates even buy out other candidates who don’t have enough money to fight elections. Some politicians reportedly spent over Rs100 million to become mayors and tens of millions to be ward chairs as they take it as an investment to earn more. Therefore we have to go for a fully PR system.But will a fully PR system not give leaders even more room to handpick their near and dear ones?There should be a provision to select candidacy through primaries, and leaders should not get to handpick candidates. Party members from respective areas would select their candidates with options through voting. The Election Commission will conduct the primaries as well. And the proportional representation method should be applied at the local level itself while selecting the candidates, so that the PR system can be implemented ground-up. Thus the candidates themselves will be fully inclusive as per the social composition of the respective area or constituency. But, at present, votes are collected from across the country and all candidates are picked from the centre, as the current PR method takes the entire country as a single constituency.Some have proposed to make the FPTP system more inclusive by allocating certain constituencies for women, Dalit and other clusters. What is your view on it?Yes, there is that school of thought. But it can’t be done permanently, so the constituencies are fixed on a rotation basis. Some countries including India are trying to implement it, but it hasn’t given expected results.Some others are for electing all the National Assembly members through the PR system and all the lower house members through the FPTP. Is such an arrangement feasible?That is meaningless as lower house representation is important in every respect. Political parties and leaders have already made the upper house a chamber to place their closed ones as well as those rejected in elections.There is one more proposal to increase the threshold to qualify to get the PR votes, which would help big parties accumulate more votes and secure more seats. Is that the right approach?We find thresholds of up to 10 percent in some countries. Our threshold should be increased. Let’s go for a fully PR system and increase the threshold to at least five percent. Why do we need so many political parties? While there are just a couple of political parties active in developed countries, why are over 100 parties registered in a poor country like Nepal? Are there so many political philosophies requiring so many parties? Why keep changing election systems even as developed countries have been using the same system for a long time?In fact, the present system is a complex one. Fully PR system will be easier and less expensive. The Election Commission’s expenditure will come down by 40 percent. The expenses of political parties and candidates will also be drastically reduced.But won’t this bar the entry of popular leaders in parliament and make the top leaders of political parties more powerful?No, those who are unpopular will be filtered out from their area in the primaries. Only those selected from the primaries will be eligible for inclusion in the PR list. Party members elect candidates of their respective party, not the leaders. Such candidates will be inclusive based on the social composition of the same place.Leaders have pledged voting rights for Nepalis abroad. How feasible is it?It is feasible, if the leaders really want to do it. But they don’t. See, election results are mostly decided by small margins. Here in the country, the leaders work hard to convince swing voters. The votes from overseas will be more unpredictable as it won’t be easy to contact and convince Nepalis staying in over 100 countries. They are out of local politicians’ control and can’t be influenced based on local dynamics. So, the leaders don’t want overseas voting because that will swing the result in unpredictable ways. Technically there is no problem with online voting. People are sending and receiving money through their mobile on the basis of OTP numbers. Those staying abroad can be connected to their booths at their respective villages through the internet. They can vote through their mobile and the list will be updated at the booth automatically. "

        "content": "Thousands of cooperative-victims staged protests in various parts of the country demanding recovery of their deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged capital-centric protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems at the earliest. What are their major grievances? What are the larger issues of the sector? And how can this growing problem be managed? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Kashi Raj Dahal, chair of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency. He is also a former chair of the Administrative Court. Excerpts:The problems with cooperatives have long been evident. So why was the crisis in the sector allowed to escalate? Basically, the cooperatives are run for economic, social and cultural uplift of its members. The organisations should be based on a community, run by their members and their governance should be self-regulatory. These are fundamental universal values. Cooperatives are organisations that can help members when they are in crisis. They are different from the profit-oriented companies. There are around 32,000 cooperatives across the country. Many of them aren’t active. Some were formed just to get funds provided by the government and they are limited to paper. If we study global trends, the majority of cooperatives work in productive sectors such as in the production of food, milk, fruits and other agricultural activities. But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly in collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered with an objective of collecting deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives are active mainly in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are in trouble.Who is tasked with monitoring and addressing the problems of cooperatives?Cooperatives fall under federal, provincial or local levels based on their nature. Those that conduct transactions at inter-provincial level are regulated by the federal government. Those who operate within a province fall under the respective provincial authority while those operating within a municipality or rural municipality are regulated by local governments. Based on this provision, only 145 cooperatives fall under the federal government. Around 19 percent are under provinces while over 80 percent fall under local units. And most of the problems are with those operating in rural areas. Majority of them are involved in savings and credit activities. The government has officially declared only 20 cooperatives as crisis-ridden. The first one was Oriental Cooperative. Coming back to your earlier question, our cooperative sector reached a state of crisis as these organisations didn’t follow fundamental values such as self-governance. They were guided by profit motives. Another problem is family control. For instance, members of a single family and their close relatives often control nearly all of an organisation’s activities. In some cases we found that someone has promoted his wife as a chair. He even signs as his wife. Likewise, husbands get loans based on the guarantee of their wives or vice-versa. Such anomalies are rampant. Many such cooperatives don’t follow even basic rules. The third problem is investment in non-productive sectors such as real estate. The fourth problem is lack of regular meetings of board of directors and general assemblies. There is a provision of an account auditing system within the cooperatives that should thoroughly check their financial health. The law has even determined the auditor’s qualifications and rules to follow. These systems haven’t been followed. Take for example the Shiva Shikhar Cooperative, one of the 20 cooperatives declared crisis-ridden. Around 3,200 of its depositors have registered complaints. Many more are in the process of doing so. Their claim for recovery is over Rs11 billion. We found that a single person has taken a loan of Rs5 billion on the guarantee of his wife. Billions of rupees have been given as loans without good collateral. Issuing loans without collateral or with weak collateral, giving loans to family members or relatives of cooperative officials are some reasons that have pushed cooperatives into crisis.Another important factor is eroding trust of these organisations. The depositors have sought a return of their deposits as the organisations have failed to recover their loans and interests invested in non-productive sectors. Even some professional cooperatives have been impacted by this phenomenon. All aren’t bad. Around 7.4 million people are connected to cooperatives, and 94,000 people are employed in the sector across. It has contributed significantly to the national economy. There are many agencies to oversee this sector. Why didn’t they address these issues on time?Like I said, the municipality-level cooperatives should be regulated by the local governments, the provincial ones should be overseen by the provinces and the national-level cooperatives should be regulated by the federal agencies. But the regulating agencies aren’t efficient enough. If the responsible agencies had stepped in on time, things wouldn’t be so bad. They lack human resources and expertise. Likewise, the work hasn’t been effective also because of frequent transfer of officials from these agencies.There has long been a demand for an all-powerful independent body like the central bank. That should have the authority to block properties and passports of the defaulters and those involved in financial embezzlement. In our recommendations, we have also stressed on the need for such a body as the cooperative crisis has already affected millions. Existing agencies can’t handle the situation. The local units, the representatives who are periodically elected and the staff working there cannot resolve these complex issues. Therefore, there is a need for a dedicated autonomous body to clean up this mess.Various organisations such as National Cooperative Federation of Nepal are active in federal, provincial and district levels. The cooperative law has entrusted them with ensuring good governance, transparency, financial discipline, regular monitoring and raising awareness in their respective areas. But they are also mostly focused on financial transactions.The Cooperative Act-2017 has a provision for a credit recovery tribunal. But it hasn’t been formed even six years after formulation of the law. Likewise, the law has made it mandatory to establish a credit information centre. Such a centre would help trace the people who take out loans from multiple places and know about the status of the loan. In its absence, we find the same person taking loans from multiple cooperatives and then defaulting. The Act has also made it mandatory to have a risk bearing fund, a reserve fund and a stabilisation fund to manage the situation in crises and protect cooperatives from probable operational losses. If these provisions are implemented, some problems of this sector can be removed.Do you think we have more cooperatives than we need?The number should be drastically cut. First of all, we should prepare a database based on the updated status of cooperatives, and they should be classified based on their performance. Those performing well should be put in the green zone, those likely to have problems should be categorised under yellow and those already in crisis due to the operators’ wrongdoings should come under the red zone. The authorities should take stringent action against those in the red zone.Cooperatives operating in the same areas with the same objectives should be merged. We see cooperatives operating in every other building. The government should encourage them to merge by giving them incentives. We can bring down the 32,000 cooperatives to around 10,000. The third measure concerns the process of registration. Only those that have good objectives, plans and promoters should be registered. Now even those registered in Kathmandu are collecting money in Pokhara and Butwal by setting up branches there.Also, auditors are responsible for promoting irregularities. They endorse wrong balance sheets even when they know a cooperative is in crisis. Such auditors should be punished.What should the depositors do?They should be well-informed about the cooperatives where they are going to park their deposits. Mostly, people are lured by high interest rates. Some choose cooperatives over banks when they have to deposit a big sum as they don’t need to show the source of the money to the cooperatives whereas banks seek the source.Should there be a provision of showing the source of money in cooperatives as well?Yes, there should be a provision of disclosing the source of deposits above a certain limit. We have to implement the money laundering Act in cooperatives. It is necessary because only around 1,000 of the 32,000 cooperatives disclose the source of money and make their transactions transparent.Many say the central bank should be entrusted with regulating the cooperative sector while others are for establishing a separate powerful entity. What is your view?The Rastra bank is busy handling the issues of the expanding banking sector. Existing infrastructure and human resources at the central bank aren’t enough to oversee the cooperative sector. It has been given a certain role even at present. It handles cooperative cases exceeding Rs500 million.Of around 32,000 cooperatives, why only 20 have been declared crisis-ridden?Eighty percent of cooperatives fall under local units. So, the local governments should declare them crisis-ridden and resolve the situation. But they don’t have that capacity. So they are requesting the federal agencies to do so citing lack of expertise. Same is the case in provinces. Bagmati and Koshi are trying to address some cases but they are facing problems. The provinces as well as local units have requested the federal agencies in writing to handle the cooperative issues. Therefore, we have emphasised the need for an all-powerful autonomous body to resolve cases nationwide. We have recently given the same feedback to the parliamentary committee as well.Declaring a cooperative crisis-stricken is not enough. We need sufficient manpower, resources and logistics to look into them. Also, security arrangements should be ensured as even gangsters are involved in embezzling big amounts of cooperatives’ deposits. Of the 20 enlisted as troubled cooperatives, the issues of only three cooperatives have been fully settled by the committee you head. At this rate, how long will it take to resolve cases of thousands of cooperatives?You see, the Dharan-based Baraha Cooperatives fell into a crisis. The municipality officials say they don’t have expertise to resolve the financial matter worth billions of rupees. Provinces share the same problem. And even the central agencies have to complete a long process before declaring a cooperative crisis-ridden.Can you elaborate on the type of body needed to resolve this crisis?An all-powerful commission should be formed. It should have the authority to arrest suspects, take people into custody, seize the property and file cases in court. It should function like the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority. It should likewise be able to issue a nationwide notice to gather information about cooperatives and categorise them in green, yellow and red zones. The existing agencies can’t resolve this issue.During a law amendment process in Parliament, lawmakers and experts were divided on whether there should be a limit in deposits of cooperatives. What is your view?The bill that was under discussion in Parliament had a provision to fix the ceiling in deposits saying that cooperatives shouldn’t be allowed to collect billions of rupees like commercial banks. But some lawmakers registered amendments and removed the ceiling.Where have the cooperatives invested most of the money?They have invested in real estates, apartments, marts, vehicles and hydro projects. A huge amount has been locked up in real estate.You said cooperatives should be self-regulated. It’s clear that they aren’t doing so. Do we need to rethink this basic idea?You are right. If they were self-regulating, we wouldn’t have needed a powerful regulatory body. Self-regulation didn’t work in our context. Therefore, we need to use the state’s coercive power. We have to change our policy orientation as the fundamental concept of self-regulation failed. Laws should be updated and there should be a structural change in our regulatory bodies. The state should present itself stringently, at least for one time, to give justice to millions of people. "

        "content": "We are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur "

        "content": "Our attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email "

        "content": "We understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal "

I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London "

        "content": "While feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email "
