Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nOn Friday, 55-year-old Shanti Devi Yadav of Janakpur was having her snacks in front of a community building at Aanptari Chowk in Narayanghat, Chitwan. Shanti Devi arrived in Narayanghat on the 19th day of walking all the way from her home for a cause. She is a member of the 22-member team that is marching from Bhardaha of Saptari district to Kathmandu to save the Chure region from illicit activities. The team is marching under the banner of Chure and Forest Conservation Campaign.The Chure range features a string of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west along the south of the Mahabharat hills. The range is around 20-30 km wide and 1,000 km long. Natural sources of water originating from the foothills of Chure are gradually drying up in the last few years, causing depletion of the first layer of the underground water in Bhawar (the area between Chure and the Tarai) and Tarai, experts say.The campaigners started the long march on April 28 in a bid to exert pressure on authorities concerned about the unchecked deforestation and haphazard extraction of sand and stones in the Chure region, which has resulted in an acute water crisis in Tarai.The campaigners, who walk around 35 to 40 kilometres daily, are on their way to Kathmandu, the national capital. They are scheduled to organise a sit-in at Maitighar, Kathmandu, to bring to light the worsening situation of Chure region.In Shanti Devi’s house in Pulchowk, Janakpur, a hand pump has been running dry at the start of March for the past seven years. “It neither rains in the winter nor in April/May,” Shanti Devi said. “Our settlement is facing a water crisis.”Nanda Mukhiya, aged 58, of the same settlement strongly believes they should put pressure on the government for a solution to the longstanding problem. Nanda is not well, yet he is more worried about the impending environmental crisis that the future generations will have on their hands rather than about his frail health.“I set off on the long march with a cache of medicines in order to preserve our water sources,” Nanda said. “Wells, ponds and hand pumps started drying up in the area. Our life in Madhesh is now difficult.”Sunil Yadav, the central coordinator of the Chure and Forest Conservation Campaign, said water sources in Tarai started drying up due to the destruction of Chure region. He claims that the government, all three levels of it, and the concerned authorities are not bothered about controlling unchecked deforestation in the Chure and Madhesh regions.Sunil, a permanent resident of Simraungadh Municipality-2 in Bara district, had worked in a motorcycle workshop in Kalaiya until eight years ago. He used to read news and articles on the deforestation in Chure region, its impacts and possible solutions. “I realised that there will be a crisis in Madhesh unless the rampant deforestation in Chure is not controlled,” he said.The campaign has launched the long march with a 12-point charter of demands. The campaigners ask for strong action against the forest officers who work hand in glove with smugglers, control of illegal extraction of river-bed materials from the rivers and streams in the Chure region, declaration of Madhesh as a dry zone, and concrete plans to control forest fires. They also demand that Dilip Mahato, an environmental activist who was killed for raising his voice against illegal extraction of sand and pebble, be declared the country’s first conservation martyr.Twenty-four-year-old Mahato, who had been protesting against illegal mining of Aurahi riverbed material, was dragged and killed by a tipper truck in the wee hours on 10 January, 2020.The campaign had organised a similar long march to Kathmandu last year demanding control of the pollution of the Sirsiya river that flows through Birgunj, a major business and industrial hub in Parsa district of Madhesh Province. The campaigners met high level government officers and ministers in Kathmandu. “The then home minister and industry minister had assured us they’d take initiatives for the control of water pollution in the river,” Sunil said. “But nothing has happened yet.”The Sirsiya river has become highly polluted due to the toxic industrial waste generated by several factories on the Parsa-Bara Industrial Corridor. The factories release untreated waste into the river, locals say, resulting in the waterway turning into an open sewer.In its 12-point demand, the campaign has included the issue of Sirsiya River this time as well. “The government does not have a suitable policy on the posting and transfer of forest officials. Some officers stay in the same area for years under political protection. They support smugglers instead of taking strong action against them,” said Sunil, urging all to join hands for the conservation of the Chure region.Of the 22 members in the long march, 13 are women. The long march will conclude after reaching Maitighar, Kathmandu, in a few days. The campaigners said they will launch an hour-long sit-in every day in front of the party office of major political parties and submit the 12-point memorandum.“This march is not for an individual,” Shanti Devi said, as she continued having her snack. “Despite hardships, I decided to participate to protect our society and the whole nation from an impending environmental crisis.” \nThe Ministry of Health and Population plans to install an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountainous districts, aiming to lessen postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort using an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.“Deaths of new mothers and newborn babies are high due to hypothermia [a condition that occurs when the body’s core temperature drops below 35°C] in the mountain regions,” said Dr Gauri Shrestha, chief of the Safe Motherhood Programme of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We hope that floor heating systems at birthing centres will help in reducing these deaths.”Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The report of the nationwide study shows that 21 children in every 1,000 live births die within a month. The figure was the same in 2016.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.Likewise, the report shows that as of 2022, in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications in Nepal. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016, for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.Every year, hundreds of women in the country succumb to preventable deaths, which include hypothermia, according to maternal health experts.Officials at the Family Welfare Division said they have proposed allocating the required amount in the new budget for the upcoming fiscal year.Floor heating systems will be set up in birthing centres of Solukhumbu, Tehrathum, Ramechhap and Sindhupalchok districts, Shrestha said. “This would be good to have in birthing centres of other districts as well but a slash in the health budget does not support an extension of the programme.”The health ministry has decided to start several programmes, including a ‘special newborn care unit’, in all district hospitals nationwide to reduce newborn deaths.For that, it has started training doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in the district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.Similarly, several measures have been taken to curb maternal deaths, including the distribution of non-pneumatic anti-shock garments.The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment is a low-cost first-aid device that limits persistent postpartum bleeding. The technology applies external pressure to a woman’s lower body to drive the blood flow upwards.Experts say the device reduces blood flow to the uterus and treats hypovolemic shock, an emergency condition in which a severe loss of blood or other fluids makes the heart unable to pump enough blood to the body. The special suit can keep a woman with postpartum bleeding alive for up to 48 hours. Without the suit, the woman may bleed out within 30 minutes. The device buys critical time to transfer a patient to a healthcare facility and provide her treatment. It is also lightweight, washable and can be reused, officials said.Excessive bleeding during or after childbirth is a major cause of maternal deaths in Nepal, which the authorities have been struggling to lessen for years. It is the largest direct cause of maternal mortality worldwide and is responsible for more than a quarter of the 300,000 estimated deaths each year. \nIn his political document, Ghanashyam Bhusal, general secretary of the ruling CPN (Unified Socialist), has described capitalism as the major obstacle in achieving prosperity and socialism in the country. Bhusal emphasises his party’s goal as establishing Nepal as a socialist society in his document that he will present at the party's 10th general convention scheduled to be held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 4.Bhusal, who is praised as a socialist thinker by many, states in the paper that socialism has been the goal of all thinkers, philosophers, sages and social reformers in history inspired by human ideals.The Constitution of Nepal, which is a compromise document of major political forces such as Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, CPN (Maoist Centre), Madhes-based regional forces and other fringe parties, defines Nepal as a ‘socialism-oriented’ country.However, some left-leaning commentators didn’t buy his argument. Dambar Khatiwada, a political analyst, said that Nepali politicians, mainly communist leaders, often try to advocate a “redundant political philosophy”. He argued such a tendency has rather restricted Nepal from progressing in a true sense.“They first need to define what capitalism means before criticising it,” Khatiwada told the Post.For Khatiwada, socialism is a political philosophy, whereas capitalism is the reality. “Should we live in fantasy or reality?” he said. “They must be clear about this at first.”Bhim Bhurtel, an expert on political economy, describes Bhusal’s statement on socialism and capitalism as rebranding the old philosophy with new rhetoric, “which is meaningless”.“The philosophical understanding of our communist leaders is like a vehicle driven by a novice,” Bhurtel told the Post. “Their statements presented in such party meetings and conventions don’t have any meaning because they don’t implement the same policies when they are in the government.”Bhusal has proposed a ‘progressive parliament and a corruption-free party linked to production’ in his political document.In the 24-page report, Bhusal claimed that this was the path to be followed by most of Nepal's Communists and Marxists.While analysing political and economic life, one can see the challenges it has posed to the revolution, reads his report. “Crony capitalism has determined the general conditions of our economic life today, while parliamentary democracy has determined the general conditions of our political life.”Bhusal has presented his arguments to prove the relevance of their move to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) by splitting the country’s largest communist party, the CPN-UML, in 2021.He said the party was formed with an aim to develop it as one of the country's leading political forces.“Our party was established with an objective to revive a genuine communist movement after serious ideological, theoretical and organisational deviation seen in the CPN-UML,” reads Bhusal’s political document.The CPN-UML split in 2021 after a prolonged factional feud between the establishment faction led by party chair KP Sharma Oli and the dissident side led by former prime ministers Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal.The political document presented by the party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal in the politburo and central committee meeting held on May 15 severely criticised the mother party, the CPN-UML.In the political document to be presented in the 10th general convention of the party, Unified Socialist chair Nepal has dubbed the UML “a right-wing opportunistic party”. “UML is a party that does not hesitate to destroy the constitution and democracy,” the document reads.In his 57-page document, Nepal tries to justify the party split.Then prime minister KP Sharma Oli had dissolved the previous Parliament twice. Oli’s unconstitutional move was one of the reasons for the party’s split as the dissident faction led by Nepal and Khanal strongly opposed Oli’s move. \nOver a month since its formation, the committee to select candidates for chairpersons and members of the two transitional justice commissions has yet to start its work.A Cabinet meeting on April 12 constituted a five-member committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former chief justice, to nominate the candidates for both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. Four of the members were picked by the government, while the National Human Rights Commission chairperson or any member he recommends is also on the panel.The constitutional rights watchdog, however, has refused to send its member saying that it needs a time-bound commitment from the government to endorse a bill to amend the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act.“We have not held a single meeting so far. I don’t think the committee will commence its work until the human rights commission sends its representative,” Arjun Karki, a committee member, told the Post.The committee was constituted last month despite reservations from the conflict-era victims of human rights violation and the human rights defenders who demanded an amendment to the Act before selecting the office bearers. The government, however, said formation of the committee was necessary as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.Following the court’s order, the victims and the human rights defenders demanded the government and the parties endorse the bill to amend the Act by the top court’s deadline before starting the selection process. However, the amendment bill couldn’t be endorsed within the deadline, prompting the government to form a committee based on the existing law.Following the committee’s formation, the victims and human rights defenders requested the government to halt the selection process until the Act is amended. They also urged the national rights watchdog to refrain from sending its representative.“Amending the Act is a pre-requisite to deciding on the transitional justice process. It is good that the selection committee is dormant now,” Suman Adhikari, founding chairperson of the Conflict Victims Common Platform, told the Post. “I hope the National Human Rights Commission doesn’t deviate from its stand.”There has been no discussion on the bill that is under consideration of the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of Parliament ever since a change in the ruling alliance on March 4. The Nepali Congress, which maintained that the bill must be endorsed through a vote when it was in government, has changed its stance after being pushed to the opposition side.The two commissions have been inactive since July 2022 after the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government had claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022 and the appointments be made based on the revised Act.However, nearly two years later, nothing has been achieved as the parties are split on several provisions of the bill. The truth commission has received 63,718 complaints while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases.“We have seen what types of people it selected the last time. I don’t understand why a tested and failed person has again been picked to make the recommendations,” said Adhikari.Stakeholders have also demanded consultations before any decision on the transitional justice process is made. However, the Mishra-led panel was formed without informing victims and human rights defenders. \nAfter weeks-long uncertainty following parliamentary obstruction and negotiations to open it, the ruling and opposition parties on Saturday agreed to form a parliamentary panel to probe the cooperative scam. The main opposition Nepali Congress had been obstructing the House since last month demanding a parliamentary probe into Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the cooperatives scam. Lamichhane’s name has been linked with several cooperatives based in Pokhara, Butwal and Chitwan. According to reports, he had taken millions of rupees from the three cooperatives. A meeting of the ruling and opposition parties held at the prime minister’s residence on Saturday evening agreed to form such a parliamentary probe panel whose terms of reference could be finalised on Sunday, according to the leaders present at the meeting. With this development, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s plan to take a vote of confidence on Monday will go ahead smoothly, said leaders. The formation of the parliamentary panel and understanding on the terms of reference will also pave the way for the resumption of the parliamentary proceedings and unveiling of the government’s annual budget on May 28. The meetings of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly will resume from Sunday, Padam Giri, the minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, told the Post.According to Giri, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who was demanding time to speak in the House and clarify his position on the allegations against him in the cooperatives scam, will speak at Sunday’s House meeting. Nepali Congress, which was preventing the home minister from speaking in the House, agreed to let Lamichhane speak and clarify his position on his alleged role in the cooperative funds embezzlement.According to a Congress leader, the name of Home Minister Lamichhane will not be mentioned in the ToR but the names of the cooperatives where he allegedly embezzled deposits will be stated. The party had been demanding a probe focused on Lamichhane. “We took this decision at the prime minister’s repeated requests in order to break the prolonged House deadlock. This will help with the tabling of various bills and in bringing the budget. Most importantly, this will foil [CPN-UML chair] Oli’s plan to dissolve the House and take the country into midterm polls,” the Congress leader said.“That is why we showed flexibility. The ToR of the proposed task force will now include the names of the cooperatives whose funds were embezzled by Lamichhane and his partners when he ran a television company,” said the leader.Though the Congress and other opposition parties had been demanding a parliamentary panel, the key ruling parties, the UML and the Rastriya Swatantra Party, were strongly against it.Ramesh Lekhak, chief whip of the Nepali Congress, said the meeting of the top leaders of the major political parties discussed the resumption of the House and a breakthrough was eventually made.“Now we all agree on the parliamentary committee’s formation. This is a positive development ... The law minister will coordinate the task force,” Lekhak said after the meeting.Leaders of ruling and opposition parties decided to form a four-member task force to prepare the ToR of the parliamentary committee. Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Minister Padam Giri from the UML, the party’s chief whip Mahesh Bartaula, and Shisir Khanal from the Rastriya Swatantra Party are its members, according to Lekhak. “We will try our best to conclude the ToR by Sunday evening when the task force convenes its first meeting,” Khanal told the Post. Giri represents the government, while three other leaders represent ruling and opposition parties. But there is no representation from CPN (Maoist Centre), the prime minister’s party.“I have called the first meeting of the taskforce at 8:00 am on Sunday. I am trying to finalise the TOR tomorrow itself,” Giri told the Post.Attending the Saturday meeting, which came at the initiative of Prime Minister Dahal, were Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, UML chair KP Sharma Oli, Home Minister Lamichhane and second-rung leaders of various parties.On Saturday, Speaker Devraj Ghimire had advised Prime Minister Dahal and UML’s Oli to reach an agreement with the Congress by Sunday afternoon.“If the House session does not resume by Sunday, the government will be forced to bring the budget through an ordinance,” Ghimire had said at a function earlier on Saturday. “So I have urged the top leaders to come to a conclusion at the earliest.” Ghimire has called the House meeting for 11:00 am on Sunday. “We will try to draft the ToR before the House meeting,” said Lekhak. On Saturday morning, Prime Minister Dahal met Congress leaders and later Speaker Ghimire, Oli and Lamichhane.Hundreds of cooperatives across the country are in trouble and some three dozen large ones have been declared as crisis-ridden. Cooperative owners and management have embezzled billions of rupees deposited by millions of people. The government has been under constant pressure to heed the demands of the protesting victims of cooperatives fraud from around the country. \nInternet service providers say they are awaiting the full text of the Supreme Court’s ruling to pay the taxes they raised from the public.The service providers (ISPs) raised nearly Rs4 billion in rural telecommunications development fees and royalty charges on maintenance from the public since the fiscal year 2017-18 but did not transfer the amount to the government.The ISPs have been arguing that the former parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had ordered the fees’ waiver.On May 13, the top court scrapped the writ petition filed by Worldlink Communications and ordered the ISPs to pay the government taxes that they had raised from the public.“We will obey the Supreme Court’s verdict. As the writ petition has been scrapped, we are discussing with the Nepal Telecommunications Authority on the amount that ISPs owe to the government and the payment modality,” said Binay Bohra, owner of the Vianet internet service provider.The tug-of-war between the ISPs and the government deprived thousands of people of the service when the Indian vendor on which the ISPs rely for the Internet bandwidth suddenly severed the link for hours.On May 2, Airtel, a leading telecom provider of India, cut upstream services to Nepal after the dispute between the government and ISPs over the payment dispute remained unresolved for months. The disruption started at around 5 pm and the services were restored after around five hours.According to the Internet Service Providers Association of Nepal, Airtel provides around 70 percent of upstream services to Nepal.Airtel agreed to restore the service after the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulator, promised to sort out the payment issue ‘responsibly.’For nearly two years, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology has reiterated that unless the ISPs pay the due taxes, it will not recommend the foreign exchange to be made available by the Nepal Rastra Bank to the service providers so they can forward the payment to upstream service providers.The ISPs have not paid the charges as the erstwhile parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had a few years ago ordered the government to exempt them from taxes on non-telecom components like web service, co-location, hosted service, disaster recovery, managed service, data centre, and cloud service.Following the order, in a letter dated July 15, 2018, the licensing department of Nepal Telecommunication Authority wrote to the Inland Revenue Department requesting that internet service providers not be subjected to telecommunication charges for non-telecommunication services.The committee said that internet service providers do not have to pay royalties and Rural Telecommunications Development Fund charges for three fiscal years: 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20.But the auditor general brought the issue to light.Nepal's constitutional supreme audit body pointed out that such fees, which the ISPs have raised from the public, should not be waived and instructed recovery of the charges. Following this, the government wrote to the ISPs to clear the dues.The current Public Accounts Committee has ordered the government to recover the dues from the ISPs.Nepali ISPs owe Airtel more than $30 million (Rs4.3 billion). They defaulted on payments for upstream services a year ago.The Indian vendors also threatened to suspend services starting January 1 this year if Nepali ISPs failed to settle the outstanding dues. However, following a change in government, the issue remains unresolved.The ISPs’ annual transactions near Rs27 billion, with the government earning more than Rs9 billion in revenue under eight headers.Around 10.6 million people use the internet in Nepal through 20 ISPs in the country, including the state-owned Nepal Telecom. ISPs say they provide direct employment to more than 15,000 people. \nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives is expected to run parliamentary proceedings impartially following democratic norms. In parliamentary tradition, after being elected, the Speaker dissociates himself or herself from the party that gave the election ticket to maintain neutrality.Speakers in Nepal, however, have often run into controversies. They have also been accused of failing to maintain neutrality while conducting parliamentary business. At times, they are accused of working at the behest of the mother party.The Speaker’s role becomes crucial in minimising inter-party rivalry that often leads to a political deadlock. Some Speakers such as Daman Nath Dhungana and Subas Nembang have successfully played that role as well.The incumbent Speaker Devraj Ghimire also faces the charge of failing to demonstrate an impartial role.On Saturday, Ghimire addressed a gathering organised by a provincial chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists where he said since Parliament had been held hostage, “some measures may need to be taken”. He went on to say that the government may be forced to introduce the fiscal budget through an ordinance should the House deadlock prolong.His controversial statement came ahead of political leaders’ consultations on the day as they tried to find a way out of the impasse. Soon afterwards, Ghimire attended a meeting convened by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief.The opposition leaders have fiercely criticised the Speaker mainly after the May 16 incident when the Congress and the UML lawmakers had a scuffle during the House meeting. A UML lawmaker, Ghimire formally disassociated himself from the party after being elected the Speaker in early 2023.Experts on parliamentary affairs say Speaker candidates must be picked carefully, analysing if they can do justice to the top position of the legislature. When the Speakers are selected on the basis of their relations with party leaders, they often take decisions to suit the leaders they are grateful to.Speaker is a crucial constitutional position, former Speaker Daman Nath Dhungana told the Post. But political parties often give the post to someone from the party so as to satisfy their aspirations.On May 15, UML chair Oli hinted that as Congress lawmakers had continuously been barring Home Minister Lamichhane from speaking in the House, the situation would be changed. Congress, the main opposition party, has been disrupting the House proceedings, demanding a parliamentary inquiry against Lamichhane in his alleged connections with cooperative funds embezzlement. \"It is unacceptable to us that only the Congress speaks in the meeting. Congress is not the only party in Parliament,” Oli said at the UML parliamentary party meeting on May 15. “Home Minister Lamichhane will speak at the parliament meeting tomorrow; if not, our party will speak.”The next day, Speaker Ghimire allowed Home Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and make his statement while Congress lawmakers were already chanting slogans. Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML. Speaker Sapkota had allowed Sharma to table the bill amid obstruction from the UML.The UML also accused Speaker Sapkota of aiding the party’s split. The UML at the time had urged the Speaker to sack 14 UML lawmakers, who defected to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) under Madhav Kumar Nepal. However, the Speaker refused to formalise the UML’s decision. The UML persistently protested in Parliament demanding Sapkota’s resignation as Speaker.In January 2019, Speaker Mahara was accused of siding with the ruling party during the passage of the National Medical Education Bill, even though the Congress had contested some of the bill's clauses. Additionally, he came under fire for not allowing Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to voice his opinion in the House before inviting then-prime minister Oli to speak on the contentious Guthi Bill. Ramchandra Paudel, a former Congress leader who became the Speaker after the 1996 midterm election, even faced impeachment for his role in Parliament. An impeachment motion was registered against him on September 23, 1998, for aiding the passage of a bill amid obstructions from the main opposition UML.In principle, the Speaker shouldn’t carry forward the House business even if a single parliamentarian raises his hand, says Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who has followed Parliament for more than two decades.The Speaker has the right to marshal security personnel against a parliamentarian if they disrupt the House proceedings, but s/he cannot carry forward the House business when there is an obstruction, Thapa told the Post. \nElated after clearing the advocate licensing exam, a young lawyer—adorned in a new black suit and white shirt—walks into the Bar but is told to “be seated behind the furniture railing”. Dispirited, the person walks into a bar where the bartender says, “You can’t practice law here”. Both the Bar and the bar serve as metaphors here, but they are significant in understanding the challenges young lawyers face after years of formal education and passing the bar exams following admission to the Bar. While the Bar admits them, it does not adopt or foster them. The junior bar has always felt orphaned by the Bar; therefore, it most likely will once more renew its demand to the Nepal Bar Association (NBA) to redress the plight of young lawyers in the biennial jamboree of lawyers being held on May 17, 18 and 19.Conference of lawyersThe NBA brings together lawyers from all over Nepal for a three-day conference every two years. The biennial conference is distinct from the annual general meetings held every year. One unique feature of the NBA is that compared to some other professional associations, it disjoints the elections to choose office-bearers from the convention of lawyers. This year, the conference is centred around two themes. The first theme, “Competent Lawyers, Dignified Bar”, a trade union issue, corresponds to the NBA’s objective to increase the public’s confidence and esteem regarding law practice. The second theme, “Restructuring of the Judiciary”, aligns with the broader public interest concern to increase faith in the judiciary and enhance the independence of the court and judges. Between the two themes, there are no prizes for guessing that the first, although more important for the junior bar, will receive less consideration than the second. This is because the second theme carries with it constitutional overtones, which effortlessly capture the interest of the lawyers. Lawyers will take part in an expressive debate on a range of topics, such as the hierarchy of Bar and non-Bar judicial appointees, the rationale behind the representation of the Chief Justice in the Constitutional Council, the judiciary-executive balance in the Judicial Council, the necessity of parliamentary hearing of judges, and the judicial performance of the Constitutional Bench. The conference must furnish realistic proposals for constitutional amendments. After all, if the Bar is strengthened to protect the independence of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will, in turn, be able to protect the Constitution. Barring politicsA lawyer is entitled to be a supporter or member of a political party or hold a specific political belief. Political allegiance should not be a cause to target a lawyer, nor should it be a reason to debar or discourage them from building a practice. Lawyers’ political leanings and inclinations inherently attach them to politics. However, the political influence that people trained in law are able to exert in public affairs, because they occupy more than one-third share among the three state-political organs, inquires into the political affiliation of lawyers and their proclivities an inquisitive exercise. The election for the barkeepers of the NBA, which is held every three years, conducted by dividing the candidates into panels organised openly under the tutelage of political parties, exacerbates the politics of party division and polarisation. Therefore, the question confronting the NBA today is whether its members should “practise law” or “practise politics”. The answer is obvious: The NBA cannot be an apolitical organisation, but at the same time, the practice of law should come before the practice of politics for the members of the Bar. Hence, rather than prioritising party politics, the NBA’s primary focus should be on the welfare of lawyers, continuing legal education, increasing the professional competency of its members, meritorious (and also inclusive) standards for judicial elevations, accountability of the judges and their independence and, of course, guidance and counselling for young lawyers. If the NBA can notch significant achievements on these fronts, its elections structured in party lines might be considered excusable. A Bar Association co-opted by political parties will neither garner the public’s confidence nor encourage young lawyers to participate in the Bar’s politics. Raise the junior bar Let’s circle back to the initial topic concerning the young advocate entering the Bar. Earlier last month, the Nepal Bar Council allowed entry to approximately 950 lawyers, mostly young graduates. On the one hand, it is encouraging to see more and more students showing interest in studying law and starting a career in law each year. On the other hand, a shrinking economy, inadequate employment opportunities, uncertainty regarding the future of a legal career, and the allure to migrate abroad for better jobs and living prospects are a few factors that discourage young graduates from building legal practice.Although young law graduates acquire knowledge of law in law schools, they have little understanding of how to establish the practice of law. The intervention of the Bar becomes necessary here, especially to ease the transition for young graduates from law school knowledge to practical legal skills. For the Bar, the first task is to bring all the issues to the table and establish a connection with the latest crop of young lawyers to understand their needs and concerns. An institutionalised and active junior Bar section is positioned to fill the connection gap. The second task for the Bar, running a mentorship initiative to cultivate the professional skills of young lawyers, is far easier to conceive than execute. But there is always a place to begin. The Bar should applaud the law firms already recruiting young lawyers and providing them exposure to legal practice. In addition, the Bar has to take the initiative to create a platform to bring together different generations of lawyers for collaboration and knowledge exchange. Lastly, the Bar can leverage its relationship with other industry and professional associations to increase internship and job opportunities and hold career expos. Young lawyers are future leaders of the Bar but are also integral to the legal practice at present. The Bar cannot afford for them to fail. The NBA’s biennial conference should not be limited to a speech festival but should place young lawyers at the centre of its declarations. The responsibility of the Bar lies in ensuring that the graduates who passed out after taking the Bar examination do not pass-out from the legal profession.   \nMedia literacy empowers individuals to critically analyse the complex media landscape, enabling informed decision-making and fostering active societal participation. Unfortunately, the Government of Nepal, media houses, civil society organisations and media development organisations don’t prioritise it. As a result, media literacy is thinly referenced in our legislative framework. The Constitution of Nepal 2015 articulates the right to opinion and expression (Article 17[2a]), the right to communication (Article 19), and information (Article 27) while not mentioning the phrase. However, these provisions indirectly advocate for media literacy. Similarly, the National Mass Communications Policy 2016, without using the phrase, indirectly calls for actions promoting the same. For instance, Objective 1.1 of the National Mass Communications Policy seeks to create a civilised and prosperous society by ensuring accountable mass media based on democratic principles and the right to freedom of expression. This involves integrating media literacy through promoting access to diverse information sources and promoting critical thinking skills.Critical thinking The National Census of Nepal 2021 (2078 BS) records Nepal's literacy rate at 76.3 percent, with disparities in literacy levels among different geographic regions, castes, creeds and ethnicities. The literacy rate itself tells about the status of media literacy in Nepal.Most of the population tends to accept media information at face value, lacking the ability or inclination to analyse its content critically. A section of the population, comprising social activists, media workers, teachers, businesspersons and professionals, applies critical lenses to the media’s content. Various factors influence media content, including ownership, advertising, political ideology, philosophical inclinations, diversity of media workers, corporate interests and soft power dynamics. In research for his Master of Philosophy thesis, Govinda Dhital has written that headteachers in secondary schools demonstrate high levels of media literacy across seven dimensions: Access, retrieval, understanding, use/communication, analysis, evaluation and creativity.The audience's response and feedback to media content also serve as indicators of media literacy. However, this engagement seems to have diminished over the past decade. Interestingly, scandals and gossip about political leaders and celebrities and stories related to love, sex and failed social relationships still receive engagement from the audience, especially on social media. Notably, short, entertaining videos on platforms like TikTok often garner more interaction than in-depth investigative news reports despite the latter requiring significant resources and efforts to produce.Another indicator of the general population's critical awareness is the extent to which people file complaints about media performance. According to the Press Council Nepal’s database, 221 complaints were registered against the media in 2079-80 BS (2022-23), compared to 203 complaints registered in the PCN in 2078-79 BS (2021-22) and 192 in 2077-78 BS (2020-21).Evaluating content Most people find it challenging to evaluate the credibility and reliability of various media sources, a critical aspect of media literacy. Many are unaware of the potential biases or affiliations of media houses with corporate entities, power holders or the government. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic, individuals took health decisions based on misleading information, exemplifying the lack of source evaluation skills. This led to a surge in the acquisition of Vitamin D capsules, giloy (gurjo) herbs and turmeric.People also fail to understand media techniques like framing, editing and using language or images to manipulate or sway opinions, indicating a low level of media literacy. During the campaign for the 2022 parliamentary elections in Nepal, social media users disseminated doctored photographs of politicians and exploited out-of-context video clips to confuse voters. Additionally, a 2021 study by Media Action Nepal found that out of 49,051 news articles surveyed, 1,817 contained false or misleading information.Ownership and influenceUnderstanding the commercial and political interests that may influence media content, including recognising when content is sponsored or influenced by advertisers or special interests, is another indicator of media literacy. This, too, is low among the majority of the audience. However, social activists, media professionals, educators, businesspersons and other professionals understand this dynamic. Anecdotal evidence from my conversation with them in several parts of the country reveals that some individuals actively cross-check information from local FM stations, as they can readily identify which stations are supportive to which political parties.Formats and genresAn important aspect of media literacy involves distinguishing between various types of media content, such as news, entertainment, advertising and opinion pieces and understanding the conventions and purposes of each. Unfortunately, many individuals struggle with this distinction. For instance, there are cases where people mistake a reputable news channel for an unfamiliar YouTube channel or perceive personal social media posts from journalists as official news from their respective organisations. This confusion extends to content creators, the audience cannot tell non-professional producers from professionals. The emergence of television personalities and journalists as YouTubers has led to further confusion, with their content being taken for official programming from their former television networks.Awareness about the unique aspects of digital media, including issues related to online privacy, security, digital footprints and the spread of misinformation online, is also minimal in Nepal. Access to digital security training and tools for media outlets and content producers in Nepal is limited, leaving them vulnerable to cyber threats. Moreover, most people lack awareness about the ethical responsibilities of media producers and consumers, including privacy, consent, intellectual property and the impact of media consumption on individuals and society.Media literacy effortsDespite the government's lack of prioritisation of media literacy, a few government institutions and non-governmental organisations have taken steps to strengthen it. For instance, the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) has initiated media literacy programmes mostly tailored to journalists. The Press Council Nepal (PCN) conducts interactive programmes on digital literacy that align with its objectives. Certain municipalities have also organised media skills training programmes that incorporate media literacy. Moreover, political parties and local governments have launched initiatives to guide their members on effective media relations. Furthermore, secondary school curricula include topics such as media introduction, the importance of communication, media and entertainment, information technology, digital technology, and cyber-security. These efforts collectively contribute to bolstering media literacy across various sectors of society.It is necessary to enhance media literacy in Nepal by integrating media literacy initiatives into the legislative framework and the national plan of action, including the periodic plan. Education and training programmes on media literacy must go beyond the circle of journalists. Moreover, it is imperative to promote critical thinking skills among media consumers via targeted programmes in partnership with academic institutions, government entities and civil society organisations. \nFrom historical myths to modern femtech apps, the focus of medical products aimed at women is often profit, not well-being. For centuries, women have been bombarded with a relentless marketing push for unnecessary medical products and services that often have questionable benefits for their health.From Victorian-era manuals promising control over a baby's sex to the booming modern-day female technology or femtech app market, the focus seems to be on creating a market of \"worried well\" women rather than addressing genuine health concerns.Women are known to spend far more on health compared to men, with more of women's health services subject to higher out-of-pocket expense—a healthcare cost gap that exacerbates gender-based pay inequalities. Scare-mongering medical marketing may be contributing to this problem by driving more women to unnecessary tests or treatments.Historically, doctors viewed women as the \"sicker sex,\" leading to a surge in medical advice manuals—many focusing on female reproductive health—as early as the 1820s. These manuals, often rife with misinformation, were a prime example of capitalising on women's anxieties. One of the most commercially successful popular medical books of the 19th century gave medical advice to women about how to influence the sex of their child through specific foods and conceptive practices.Another book in the late 20th century sold even more copies with a focus on this same topic. Even as numerous medical experts and research studies had long debunked the notion that the sex of infants could be influenced, products and services purporting to assist women in this flourished.Today this is still the case but in a different form: IVF clinics in some countries provide for women and couples who wish to have a child of a specific sex, by selecting embryos on this basis. It's a costly process: US fertility clinics charge around $4,500 for sex selection—on top of the cost of IVF, which sets patients back around $12,000-$14,000 per cycle.Menopause is another area heavily targeted by marketers. This natural life stage has long been a major focus of gendered commercial targeting—through advice manuals, hormonal balancing programmes and coaching services, and especially through hormonal and pseudo-hormonal products. In 2024, the market for menopause medical products was valued at around $758.5 million, outstripping other medical products marketed at women worldwide by more than double. In Australia, a major 2023 study found there are strong financial incentives to \"catastrophise\" menopause to drive women to purchase treatments. The authors from the Australasian Menopause Society, the Women's Health Research Program at Monash University and Jean Hailes for Women's Health, welcomed the fact \"that perimenopause and menopause are now being discussed publicly\"—but cautioned medical marketers to avoid \"catastrophising\" menopause, \"particularly in the advertising of goods and services, as it could have the unintended consequences of eroding women's resilience and stigmatising women as they approach midlife.\"While there is no doubt that some women suffer disruptive hot flashes and other symptoms in menopause, many do not at all, and known menopause symptoms are claimed to be found only in Western cultures. The globalisation of menopause marketing is therefore creating new markets of \"worried well\" women who otherwise might not consider they needed medicating. Researchers have referred to this as \"disease-mongering\". In the case of menopause products, it may be deeply problematic given the emerging evidence that hormone products taken by midlife women may influence their later risk of diseases of ageing such as dementia and stroke.The rapidly growing femtech industry is another area where some companies are cashing in on women's health—in a way that may not always benefit women as promised. Femtech is a form of women's health technology that has been rapidly growing since 2018. In 2023, the femtech app market was valued at approximately $30 billion and is projected to reach $135 billion by 2032—that is an expected compound annual growth rate of 16 percent.The rise of femtech apps seems like a step forward, offering support for issues like reproductive health or general wellness, which are often overlooked by traditional medicine. Femtech may provide support for some women's health issues that are currently underserved by medical services, such as endometriosis, women's ADHD, and seronegative chronic diseases that often result in women's \"medical gaslighting\".However, the huge profits generated by the femtech industry's expansion raise questions about whether such projects are primarily aimed at improving women's well-being or rather at maximising the potential of women's health concerns as an extractable market. There is growing concern that many women's health apps have inadequate privacy and security practices. Fertility apps, for example, often collect sensitive data about pregnancies and menstrual cycles—and sometimes then share it with others, exposing it to \"re-identification\" and data breach risks. These apps are not always transparent about the data they trade with and collect from other companies.-360info \nAs the midsummer heat threatens to bring a wave of the loo in the plains of Tarai-Madhes, all eyes are on the sky, expecting a spell of cloudbursts and rain. But once the monsoon enters in less than a month, we will be back to running for shelter. This year, Nepal, like much of South Asia, could experience above-normal monsoon rains, the result of La Niña, a condition associated with normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over much of South Asia. Technical experts at the 28 sessions of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum (SASCOF-28) held in the last week of April said the second half of the southwest monsoon season will likely develop La Niña. This will also mark the realisation of the fear of two extremes—of heat and rain—in South Asia this year.While we stand to make some windfall from the wet climate, especially in the agricultural sector, there is a huge cost attached to the onslaught of heavy monsoon rains—landslides and flooding. Each monsoon, we fear the worst disasters but make little preparation to deal with them. And if we do not prepare in advance, the bounty we expect from the monsoon will soon turn into bane. Last monsoon, Nepal witnessed 328 events of landslide, 166 events of heavy rain and 59 events of flooding, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). Ninety-six persons were killed in landslides, 19 in floods and eight in heavy rains. This means that our existing mechanisms of defence against destruction will probably not work. We might face similar or even bigger catastrophes this year, too, if we do not prepare well.But as of now, news reports about advanced preparation for disasters are hardly positive. If the unitary state of the past was inefficient in dealing with disasters, the federal state of Nepal has its own complications. While authorities at the NDRRMA complain of a lack of human and financial resources to deal with large-scale disasters, the local levels, which are the closest and the most accessible forms of the state to the people, have similar woes. The familiar problem of a lack of coordination between the three tiers of government stands to dampen our disaster preparedness and response actions.Another set of disasters that comes as part of the monsoon each year is water-related epidemics. Each monsoon enters with the risk of dengue, malaria, and cholera. And it is in these crucial times that our health care system does not function optimally, with health centres in several parts of the country failing to provide basic medicines and care. We cannot make lethargy a habit and wait for disasters. From daivi prakop (divine disasters) to prakritik prakop (natural disasters), we have made some advances in our understanding of disasters. It is now time to consider disasters manaviya prakop—the result of human actions—and intervene on time for risk reduction and long-term resilience. \nA tourist couple was injured in India’s Kashmir after militants fired on them late on Saturday night, police said, ahead of voting scheduled in the volatile region for India's ongoing election.The couple from the Indian city of Jaipur was evacuated to the hospital and the area where the attack took place was cordoned off, Kashmir police said on social media. The condition of the injured tourists is said to be stable, they said.India is in the middle of a marathon election with the remaining two seats in Kashmir going to polls on May 20 and May 25.Voters turned out in large numbers for polling in the first seat in Srinagar on May 13, reversing the trend of low vote counts in the first polls since Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed the region’s semi-autonomy in 2019.Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is skipping elections in Kashmir for the first time since 1996 saying it will support regional parties instead.Major parties in Kashmir, the National Conference and People’s Democratic Party (PDP), have focused on restoration of semi-autonomy in their campaigns.Analysts and opposition parties say the BJP is not contesting elections in Kashmir because it fears the outcome will contradict its narrative of a more peaceful and integrated region since 2019.In a separate incident, unknown militants shot dead former village headman and BJP party member Ajiaz Ahmad Sheikh in Shopian district on Saturday.The last major attack on tourists in Kashmir had happened in 2017 when a Hindu pilgrimage bus was targeted, killing eight people. \nPartly cloudy with possible light rain and snowfall in hilly areas of Koshi and Gandaki provinces, mainly fair weather elsewhere, and high temperature recorded in Nepalgunj while low temperature in Jomsom.\nAPF Women won their fourth straight Lalitpur Mayor Women's T20 Championship title by defeating Sudurpaschim Province in the final, despite Sudurpaschim's valiant chase led by Kabita Joshi's 67*.\nPrime Minister Dahal seeks to avoid using an ordinance to present the budget, but faces opposition from Nepali Congress, who may obstruct its passage in parliament.\nSeven years after signing the BRI agreement, Nepal and China are still struggling to finalize the implementation plan, with concerns over financing, security, and the need for national consensus.\nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nNepal's 2020 map included disputed territories (Kalapani, Limpiyadhura) under India's control, leading to tensions between the countries, despite a joint committee addressing boundary claims; Oli's mobilization of nationalistic sentiments and return to power played a role.\nClimate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepal’s agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.“The situation is alarming,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.“The survey was intended to see people’s perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,” he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. “Most of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,” said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. “If they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.”The survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nThe widening rift between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the cooperative scam has further complicated the parliamentary process at a time when the government has the compulsion to announce the fiscal budget on May 28. Despite multiple meetings and back-channel negotiations on Friday, the ruling and opposition parties failed to narrow down their differences over the formation of the parliamentary panel. Short of an understanding, meetings of both chambers of Parliament were put off until Sunday. While the National Assembly sitting was adjourned due to an obstruction by the main opposition, the House of Representatives meeting was deferred until Sunday through a notice.A senior Rastriya Swatantra Party leader told the Post that the House session was deferred by a day at the request of Nepali Congress leaders and informal talks between the Congress, the RSP and the prime minister were headed in the positive direction.“We do not want to derail the process of forming the parliamentary probe and we also do not want to introduce the budget through an ordinance,” the RSP leader who is engaged in multiple talks with leaders from ruling and opposition sides said. “We do not want to be seen as a destabilising factor.” A Nepali Congress office bearer told the Post that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s decision to seek a vote of confidence on Monday has made them suspicious. The opposition leaders have smelt a rat after the government’s decision to withdraw the bill related to political parties and frequent changes of the conditions by the ruling parties on the parliamentary probe as well as the resumption of the house session to discuss the government’s policies and programmes and the budget presentation have created suspicion.“Now we are sensing that the government is set to bring the budget through an ordinance if our protest continues,” the Congress official said. The main opposition party is yet to decide whether to obstruct the House on Monday. Prime Minister Dahal has invited senior Nepali Congress leaders for a meeting on Saturday morning. The largest party convened a meeting of opposition parties on Friday. According to Gyanendra Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the parties were one on forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. “But we have also raised the issue that opposition parties should allow Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to speak in the House and let him clarify his position.”Instead of taking the lead to resolve the deadlock in Parliament, the way the prime minister hurriedly seeks a vote of confidence has made the Nepali Congress suspicious. Prime Minister Dahal has decided to go for a floor test on Monday. He is seeking the vote of confidence of the House after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal on May 13 withdrew its support for the government following a split in the party.Some of the prime minister's recent activities did not help resolve the deadline inside the house, Nepali Congress general secretary Gagan Thapa said. The way the prime minister decided to hurriedly seek a vote of confidence and withdraw the bill related to the Political Party Act leads us to suspect that he wants to close the budget session of Parliament and present the budget through an ordinance.The prime minister's meeting with Congress leaders on Friday evening to discuss the latest political situation was deferred till Saturday morning.According to Thapa, the prime minister’s and the CPN-UML’s game plan will result in a loss for the Rastriya Swatantra Party.“Whatever the UML chair says for public consumption, his inner interest is different. The prime minister has his own interests. Finally, the Rastriya Swatantra Party will bear the brunt of these one after another conspiracy. I do not know how seriously the RSP is taking these developments, but if the UML and the Maoist Centre will try to go on a new course, the RSP stands to be impacted a lot,” said Thapa.Thapa said that his party’s position at the moment is to obstruct the House on Monday during the session in which the prime minister goes for a floor test.Suspicions are growing between the ruling and opposition parties over the issue of budget. If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, the ruling parties will go for the budget ordinance. It is up to the Nepali Congress, said Yogesh Bhattarai of the UML.If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, there is no option but to issue the budget through an ordinance.He added that they are hopeful of having positive talks and discussions with the Nepali Congress by Saturday.But the Nepali Congress is adamant on a probe against the home minister for his alleged involvement in Pokhara, Butwal, and Chitwan-based cooperatives. The parliamentary committee is needed to investigate the home minister, Congress spokesman Prakash Sharan Mahat said. Those who are in power and hold positions of authority should not be exempted from investigation.But the RSP has been refusing to form a committee targeting the home minister.“Why is the Nepali Congress only after three cooperatives at a time when 16 cooperatives are in crisis?” said Manish Jha of the RSP.The government has declared 20 cooperative firms as deeply crisis-ridden. The top managers of these cooperatives are either facing police charges or absconding.“Why are you only after three cooperatives?” Jha asked Congress leaders. “Though we cannot probe all 31,000 cooperatives, we can probe those in crisis.” Jha said that Congress leaders have no uniform opinions on how to resolve the cooperative crisis.“It’s been difficult for us to understand whose voice is authoritative in the Nepali Congress. The Congress office bearers have differing positions on forming the parliamentary committee and its terms of reference,” said Jha. “Who do we trust? We have urged the Nepali Congress leaders to come up with an official position on the party’s letterhead.” \nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has questioned the constitutional role and the impartiality of Speaker Devraj Ghimire following a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives.After Thursday’s incident, relations between the ruling CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the main opposition, Nepali Congress, could get more sour.“The Speaker should take the main responsibility for today’s incident,” Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said during a news conference after the scuffle between the opposition and ruling lawmakers. “The Speaker was following a leader’s order.” Thapa hinted that the Speaker was guided by the ruling CPN-UML. Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions. While speaking at a function on Wednesday, Oli had stated that Thursday’s Parliament meeting would proceed despite obstruction by the Nepali Congress. “Today we saw that happen,” said Thapa. “This means the Speaker was taking orders from the leader [Oli].”Thapa claimed that when his party’s vice-president, Dhanraj Gurung, was chanting slogans demanding a parliamentary probe, Oli approached and provoked him. Then the scuffle ensued, said Thapa.Thapa also declared that the Congress will not sit for talks with anyone until a parliamentary committee is formed. Some Congress leaders were earlier in talks with their Rastriya Swatantra Party counterparts and had exchanged terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary committee, but there was no further development due to their differences. Leaders said that Thursday’s scuffle has added to the uncertainty of the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam and Lamichhane’s alleged involvement.“We were about to agree on the terms of reference [ToR] of the proposed parliamentary committee with the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” said a Nepali Congress office bearer. “But there was a disagreement after the RSP refused to include the home minister’s name in the draft.”The ToR proposed by the Congress explicitly called for probing the role of the home minister in the cooperatives scam. But the RSP has been insisting on a probe into the entire cooperatives sector and not Lamichhane.   \nThe parliamentary meeting on Thursday that was expected to end the ongoing impasse ended up in a scuffle between the ruling and opposition lawmakers.The House meeting called for 11 in the morning was postponed until 4 pm in an attempt to find a meeting point among the parties over the formation of a parliamentary panel to probe Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s embezzlement of cooperatives funds. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal himself had held meetings with ruling parties and also the main opposition Nepali Congress to find a way out. However, the ruling parties and the Congress couldn’t agree on terms of reference of the parliamentary probe committee.The ruling parties agreed to constitute the parliamentary panel to investigate the embezzlement of savings in the cooperatives and recommend action against the individuals, institutions and companies benefited illegally. However, the Congress wanted the probe focused on Rabi Lamichhane, erstwhile managing director at the Gorkha Media Network, and others who illegally benefited from Supreme, Suryadarshan, and Swarnalaxmi, among other cooperatives. The ruling parties, particularly Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), did not agree to the proposal to focus only on the cooperatives where Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane is allegedly involved. “Our demand is to constitute a parliamentary committee to investigate the problems facing the cooperative sector, including Rabi Lamichhane’s involvement in the alleged fraud. The ruling alliance is not ready for it. It wants a panel that will broadly investigate the problems in the sector without addressing our concerns. The alliance is trying to divert attention from the main issue,” said Prakash Sharan Mahat, the Nepali Congress spokesperson explaining why there could be no agreement.The ruling parties, however, say the Congress, guided by a mala fide intent, has been insisting on an investigation committee focusing on three or four cooperatives. “We had just demands: first, our chairperson must be allowed to clarify on the allegations in Parliament. Second, as problems have been seen in several cooperatives, there must be a broader investigation,” said Manish Jha, an RSP lawmaker. “Why just focus on three or four cooperatives? Why not probe the cooperatives that are led by Congress leaders?”The meeting of the House of Representatives postponed for 4 pm was held two hours later. No sooner had the meeting commenced, the Congress started chanting slogans. Amid the obstruction, Speaker Devraj Ghimire read out the letters from the President’s Office regarding the authentication of a bill and addition of ministers from the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party. The situation got tense when Ghimire asked Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and address the meeting amid the protest of the main opposition.The Congress lawmakers had already gathered at the well and were raising slogans demanding a parliamentary probe into Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling funds of several credit cooperatives.After the Speaker allowed the minister to go to the rostrum, the Congress lawmakers and senior CPN-UML leaders, who were on the front row of the ruling bench, engaged in heated verbal exchanges. The situation escalated after UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress vice president Dhanraj Gurung engaged in an intense argument. Other lawmakers from the two sides subsequently joined the resulting scuffle. Even Prime Minister Dahal and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Rekha Sharma engaged in an argument with the Congress lawmakers.Both sides have pointed fingers at each other for the tensions. “The situation escalated after the Congress lawmakers tried to stand in front of the rows designated for the ruling parties in order to prevent Home Minister Lamichhane from heading to the rostrum,” said Sharma. “The Congress is responsible for the unparliamentary behaviour.” The UML has demanded an apology from the Congress, claiming its lawmakers misbehaved with Oli.The Congress, however, said the Speaker’s irresponsible move [of inviting the home minister to the rostrum] was responsible for the unpleasant incident in the House. “The Speaker is guided by partisan interests. It was wrong of him to invite the home minister to address the House when the opposition was obstructing the House,” said Mahat. The next House meeting has been called for 11 am Friday.Earlier, the meeting of the National Assembly was also adjourned until 1:15 pm on Friday following obstruction from the Nepali Congress.The main opposition has been obstructing the budget session of Parliament since the first day of the session that commenced on May 10. However, the opposition parties had allowed the President to table the government’s policies and programmes. The RSP has said they will not agree to any probe panel targeting its chairperson. “The probe panel will be formed only if there is an agreement to investigate the Congress President [Sher Bahadur Deuba] and his son,” said Jha. “To challenge our party, those who have been in power for decades need to come clean.” \nNepal’s two biggest parties are making scathing criticism of each other.Senior coalition partner CPN-UML and the main opposition Nepali Congress, which is the largest party in the House of Representatives, have trained their guns on each other over the recent Supreme Court verdict on a multi-billion-rupee land swap scam.After the Supreme Court on May 12 issued the full text of its verdict related to the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate, at the prime location of Birtamod in Jhapa, the Congress demanded an investigation into those involved in making the decision on the land swap.Terming the court verdict as historic, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa posted a statement on social media on Tuesday, saying: “It has now been proven that the then government’s decision was wrong … Therefore, there should be further investigation against those involved.”The Supreme Court on February 7 overturned the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government's decision. On April 26, 2021, the Oli-led government allowed the use of the land exempting the ceiling for the deal. However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oli’s Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific land’s detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the court’s final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new location’s production capacity. Technical experts’ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.“It [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,” Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. “The Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,” Oli said. “They once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.”When the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. “Abiding by the court’s ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,” Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives funds’ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhane’s most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. “The parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,” Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oli’s allegations against his party. When the Oli government amended laws related to land-swapping, Thapa of the Congress, who demanded an investigation into the Oli Cabinet’s decision, was a House member. Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.“Though one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,” Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli government’s decision in the court, told the Post. “In such instances, it’s the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.”King Mahendra’s implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step. The law fixed the ceiling of land possession by individuals at 28 bighas in Tarai districts. The land exceeding the ceiling would be nationalised. Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the law’s implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information. In Birtamod, Jhapa, the Giri brothers owned 500 bighas. Before the Land Reforms Act came into effect, the Giri brothers proceeded to register the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in order to safeguard the property. Land reform laws introduced later did not apply to the land as it had already been used for agricultural purposes. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel delivered the government's policies and programmes on Tuesday after the Nepali Congress lifted the obstruction in the House of Representatives. However, the disruption continued afterwards.President Paudel read out the policies and programmes of the government in the joint sitting of the federal parliament.The Congress then blocked the proceedings of both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly and did not let the assembly table a motion of expressing gratitude to the President for delivering the government’s annual paper.It is customary for Parliament to thank the President for reading out the annual policies and programmes. The parliamentary party meeting of the Congress on Tuesday morning, however, had decided not to allow Parliament to proceed after the head of state wraps up his presentation.The Congress later responded that the policies and programmes fail to address the problems of cooperatives’ victims. The main opposition has been protesting in Parliament, demanding a parliamentary probe into the issue of cooperatives around the country embezzling the deposits of hundreds of thousands of depositors. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane is the focus of the largest party’s fury for his alleged involvement in the cooperative scam. “Our position that the government has protected the people who have swindled cooperatives victims has been reconfirmed,” said Ramesh Lekhak, the chief whip of the Congress party, while talking to the media after the policies and programmes had been read out.The main opposition party was initially not ready to allow the smooth operation of the Parliament’s proceedings. The party even warned the government and the ruling partners that it would prevent President Paudel from presenting the government's policies and programmes should its demand go unheeded.The Congress has been disrupting Parliament, demanding a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane over allegations of cooperative funds embezzlement. Lamichhane has publicly refuted the charges and asked for a chance to make his case clear in Parliament.But the Congress has been preventing Lamichhane from speaking in the House. The Congress, which appeared tough against the resumption of parliamentary business, even the presidential appearance, had relented and agreed to let the President present the programmes. But it resorted to the obstruction soon after. In 2017, the CPN-UML, while in the opposition, had been obstructing parliamentary proceedings. It allowed then-President Bidya Devi Bhandari to present the annual policies. The opposition then protested the Cabinet’s decision to increase the number of local federal units in the Tarai in the midst of the elections. The party later obstructed the motion of thanks to the President.During Speaker Devraj Ghimire’s meeting with the party chief whips on Tuesday afternoon, before the President read out the government’s annual document, the Congress had announced its plan to continue to disrupt the House after the policies had been presented.“We will continue to interrupt the House until our demand is addressed,” Congress whip Sushila Thing told the Post. “As there is no parliamentary practice of barring the head of state to present policies and programmes, we too didn’t go that uncharted route.”The party will not allow other proceedings of the two houses for as long as it takes in order to get its demands addressed, Thing said.On Tuesday morning, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa and the party’s Chief Whip Lekhak met Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to discuss the issue of parliamentary obstruction. Dahal had requested the Congress leaders to allow a smooth functioning of the legislature. The Congress leaders also claimed that the prime minister seemed positive about addressing their demand.“While meeting our leaders, the prime minister seemed positive but he has not taken the necessary steps to honour the call of the main opposition,” Congress whip Thing said. Dahal’s openness to the formation of the probe committee was one of the reasons the Congress became ready to allow the President to present the policies and programmes. Shakti Basnet, the minister of energy, water resources and irrigation, claimed that the discussion between the government and Congress was headed in a positive direction.“Until late Monday night, the Congress was adamant on barring the President from presenting the policies and programmes. But on Tuesday, we reached an agreement to allow the President to do so,” Basnet, a Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, told the Post. “The government will similarly reach an agreement with the Congress on its demand for the probe committee.”According to the Congress leaders, Sunday's meeting between the prime minister and Congress leaders also concluded positively to address the party's demand. After the Congress leaders met Prime Minister Dahal, the party held the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday morning. The same meeting allowed President Paudel to confer the government's annual policies and programmes. The ruling parties and the main opposition have been discussing smooth operation of Parliament for the past few days. However, given the inflexible positions of both sides, Tuesday’s session was expected to face trouble.“The ruling parties and the opposition need to come to a logical conclusion to open the parliamentary business,” UML whip Sunita Baral told the Post. “It looks like both sides only have discussed the issue at their ease. What we need is negotiation to resolve the issues of both Parliament and the cooperative scam.”The constitution mandates the government to present its annual budget on Jestha 15 (May 28 this year). For this reason also, the ruling and opposition parties need to close their ranks, Baral added.The ruling parties are ready to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the issues plaguing the cooperative sector. However, they are reluctant to constitute a committee with the mandate to probe Lamichhane. The Congress, too, is positive about a broad inquiry into the cooperatives, but it deems investigating Lamichhane in particular a necessity after various probes by police and other government bodies established his involvement in the scams. The Congress had disrupted the winter session of Parliament before it was prorogued on April 14, with the same demand. The party has also been obstructing the new session of Parliament that commenced on May 10. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n\nA man, who was injured while putting out a fire at Tapeshwar community forest in Godawari Municipality-4, Badikhel, succumbed to burn injuries on Tuesday.According to Senior Superintended of Police Shekhar Khanal of Lalitpur District Police Range, Shankar Pahari died while undergoing treatment at the Kirtipur-based Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre.Another injured, Ramesh Pahari, is being treated at the hospital.Meanwhile, a fire at Ananda forest in Godawari Municipality-6, Lele is yet to be brought under control. A total of 65 patients have been moved to a safer place after the fire spread to the premises of the Anandaban Hospital. \nNepal’s food safety agency has banned the sales and imports of popular Indian spice brands MDH and Everest with an immediate effect, based on the findings from several countries that they contain ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing chemical. The quality watchdog has also decided to recall and seize products currently in the customs clearance process.The move follows bans by several countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Maldives, and scrutiny by the Australian authorities.“We decided to ban the spices of the two Indian companies with immediate effect based on scientific evidence from several other countries showing high levels of carcinogenic pesticide ethylene oxide in many spice mixes. This poses a cancer risk,” said Matina Joshi Vaidhya, director general of the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control.“We will allow their sale, imports and distribution once we get clearance from the manufacturing country that they are safe to consume.” Experts say the presence of ethylene oxide, which is a flammable colourless gas with a sweet odour, in the spices, is concerning, as varieties of the products of both companies are easily available in Nepal and are popular too.Ethylene oxide is primarily used to produce other chemicals, including antifreeze. In smaller amounts, it is also used as a pesticide and sterilising agent.Lymphoma and leukaemia are the cancers most frequently associated with occupational exposure to ethylene oxide. Stomach and breast cancers may also be linked to ethylene oxide exposure.Vaidhya said countries have their own acceptable limits for pesticide use. If products are found to exceed the limits set by the department, the department will direct relevant authorities to recall them from the market.The department accordingly issued a circular to agencies on Friday to recall the spices from the market. The quality watchdog has also directed the National Food and Feed Reference Laboratory to prioritise testing for ethylene oxide.Ganesh Agrawal, an official of Jay Ganapati Enterprises in Biratnagar, the distributor of Fish Curry Masala manufactured by Everest Food Products Pvt Limited, told the Post that they knew about the issue through news reports and had planned to stop selling the product. “The sales, however, are not significant.”Earlier this month, Hong Kong and Singapore banned the sale of MDH and Everest spice brands, citing the detection of carcinogenic pesticide ethylene oxide in several spice mixes.India is the world's largest spice producer, consumer and exporter. Zion Market Research estimates India's domestic spice market to be worth $10.44 billion in 2022, and the Spices Board said India exported products worth $4 billion during 2022-23.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 946.42 tonnes of various Everest brand spices from India and other countries, amounting to Rs120 million, in the last fiscal year ending mid-July 2023. Spice imports from India alone amounted to 478 tonnes worth Rs74.65 million. Similarly, the imports of the MDH brand spice amounted to 1,143.76 tonnes worth Rs637.21 million. From India alone, Nepal imported 1,141.96 tonnes of spice worth Rs635 million.Consumer rights activists say that authorities must take urgent action as the issue is related to public health.“As the products that were found to be hazardous to public health in Hong Kong and Singapore are widely available in Nepal too, it would be irresponsible to wait for a test report to prohibit their use,” Jyoti Baniya, chairman of the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights, told the Post in a recent interview.“It will be too late to wait for the report—we should not forget that this is directly linked to public health.”The quality watchdog said they have started inspecting the department stores and groceries to remove the banned spice. \nFor decades, cross-border trade between Nepal and India was traditionally done due to social ties spanning borders. The situation now is different. It’s now an organised commercial informal trade happening at a large scale, according to a research finding. Rice appears to be a key commodity ‘highly informally’ imported from India to Nepal. The research, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, shows that only 40 percent of rice is imported to Nepal from India through a formal channel.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, leading to a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports. In the current fiscal year, the government also introduced a 13 percent VAT on some vegetables, including onions and potatoes.With this variation, the price differences between Nepal and India become 18-20 percent, or rice in India becomes cheaper by at least 18 percent.The paper said that India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west. According to a separate report by the International Food Policy Research Institute, carrying or informally transferring goods has become a full-time profession for many poor families living close to the towns along the Nepal-India border.“Carriers,” many of them women, collect the goods on the Indian side and bring them in via the open border, escaping the formal customs entry points, sometimes on foot, sometimes on bicycles and motorbikes, and always at their own risk.Presenting the report titled ‘Insights into Informal Cross-Border Trade in Agri-Food Commodities in South Asia’, Dikshya Singh, programme coordinator at SAWTEE, a South Asian think tank based in Kathmandu, said the export duty imposed by India on rice in September 2022 followed by an export ban on non-basmati rice in July 2023, fueled the informal trade.The report said that rice, vegetables, chemical fertilisers, and seeds are other agricultural products and inputs that have been largely coming through informal channels.The study reveals that this informal trade is dominated by a small group of traders forming an oligopoly. Moreover, the study indicates that large-scale informal trade is controlled by mafia-style syndicates with political backing.Anand Bagaria, managing director of Nimbus Holdings, said Nepal needs proactive measures to deal with informal cross-border trade. “Since we cannot influence our neighbouring countries’ policies, Nepal needs to be clear about what could be the right balance between inflation, government revenue, and mitigating quality-related risks while dealing with informal trade.”Singh said Nepal heavily relies on informal trade to meet its need for agricultural inputs.The report attributes the illegal import of chemical fertiliser to the persistent shortage in Nepal and cheaper rates in India.The report showed that Nepal needs 800,000 tonnes of chemical fertiliser annually. The country has been able to import 400,000 tonnes formally, and an estimated 200,000 tonnes come through informal channels. According to the report, farmers in Nepal have been informally importing a variety of seeds that are not available locally, especially hybrid seeds of vegetables, mainly due to import restrictions and to avoid non-tariff requirements.SAWTEE conducted surveys at nine customs points, including Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Biratnagar, Nepalgunj, Kakarbhitta, Krishnanagar, Jaleshwar, Suthauli, Maheshpur, and Bhadrapur and the border crossings in their periphery.“The informal trade between Nepal and India is as big as formal trade,” said Paras Kharel, executive director of SAWTEE. Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary, said that gold and silver, areca (palm) nuts, onion and garlic, poppy seed, edible oil, and black pepper are informally exported to India from Nepal. “Informal trade is rising between Nepal and India because of the price differences caused mainly due tariff advantage and tariff differences and non-tariff barriers for formal export.”“The misdeclaration of exported goods from Nepal to India needs to be addressed,” he said. For instance, Nepal exports cabbage to India from Koshi province. As India has restricted the import of other types of vegetables from Nepal, traders are exporting other vegetables like okra, chayote, and chilli under the name of cabbage, Ojha said.Article 2 of the trade treaty between Nepal and India, and the agreement on cooperation to control unauthorised trade talks about controlling informal trade. “During the bilateral discussion, be it commerce level, inter-government committee meetings, or customs director-level meetings, either annually or bi-annually, they discuss informal trade. But there hasn’t been any serious discussion about controlling informal trade,” Ojha said.Nepal raised issues like the informal import of agricultural goods from India to Nepal, while the Indian side brought up issues like the informal import of goods including areca nuts, edible oil, poppy seeds, and black pepper, but no concrete solution has been found yet, according to Ojha. Sabnam Shivakoti, joint secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, pointed out that cross-border trade that was done traditionally due to social ties across borders is not the same as the organised commercial informal trade that is happening now on a large scale. “This has been affecting agricultural and industrial sectors as they have to compete with cheap imports.”According to Shivakoti, an import restriction on dairy products was announced in February 2024 to protect domestic farmers and the dairy industry, but that led to formal imports being diverted to informal channels.Trade experts said that as the Indian government is providing eight types of subsidies on agricultural products, as a result, Nepali products become less competitive even in the domestic market, raising the informal trade to Nepal. \nNepal and Lithuania established diplomatic relations in 2005, focusing on limited trade (including medical cotton and spices), exploring high-tech cooperation (particularly in cybersecurity and laser technology), promoting tourism, and collaborating on issues of global concern like climate change.\nEU launches a guide to facilitate Nepal's Pashmina export, supporting the processing facility and aiming to elevate exports to $75 million by 2026.\nAir pollution is a leading cause of respiratory illnesses, high blood pressure, and other health issues in Nepal, with over 600 people seeking care at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital on designated days, shortening Nepalese lives by an average of five years and negatively impacting public health, economy, and development.\nDespite a lack of addiction, 19-year-old Amit vapes; Nepal's government bans e-cigarettes despite concerns that some may switch back to smoking, with 33 countries banning e-cigarettes and Nepal having no regulations.\nPre-monsoon rains and prevalent conditions increase concerns about an imminent dengue outbreak in Nepal, fueled by 57 districts reporting cases and an average weekly infection count of 50.\nThe Ministry of Health and Population plans to screen pregnant women for mental health problems, which have been emerging as a leading cause of maternal deaths.Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and prompt treatment will help cut down on maternal deaths that have been rising alarmingly of late.“We plan to start screening from Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital,” said Dr Gauri Shrestha, chief of the Safe Motherhood Programme at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “As part of the pilot, all pregnant women seeking service will be screened from the first and postnatal trimesters.”A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with the majority occurring during pregnancy.The report shows that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications.Nepal had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The report showed 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. The study was carried out in 2021.Every year, hundreds of women in the country succumb to preventable deaths from excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), which have been identified as chief causes of maternal deaths in Nepal.However, the 2021 study also shows that a significant number of maternal deaths are also caused by non-obstetric complications such as intentional self-harm.Of the 611 maternal deaths on which the study was based, 67 percent occurred during and after childbirth, according to the report.The census report shows 33 percent of the total maternal deaths occurred during pregnancy, six percent died during childbirth and 61 percent during the postpartum stage.Of the total maternal deaths, nearly a half (47 percent) occurred in Lumbini and Madhesh provinces. The report shows that 10 percent of the victims were 15 to 19 years old. Fifty-seven percent of the deaths happened in health facilities and 26 percent at homes. Of the total maternal deaths, 412 women (53 per cent) went to four antenatal care visits, and of the 173 women who died between seven to 42 days, 45 percent had received postnatal care.As part of its efforts to reduce maternal deaths, the Health Ministry has made it mandatory for women to make eight antenatal care visits and three postnatal care visits.Of the total maternal deaths, six percent (37 women) had undergone abortion or suffered a miscarriage. The report shows that 62 percent of the women took maternity services at state-run health facilities whereas 38 percent gave birth at private health centres.The report shows family members of 83 percent of women who died during or after childbirth tried to get hospital care. Forty-eight percent of those who did use hospital services did not deem it necessary to seek institutional care, according to the report.Delay in finding appropriate health facilities (57 percent), delay in reaching appropriate health facilities (33 percent) and delay in getting appropriate health services (40 percent) are three major causes of maternal deaths, the study shows. Of the total maternal deaths, 17 percent were attributed to all three aforementioned causes and 74 percent to at least one of three causes.The report suggested improving the quality of services and the referral system and making ambulances available for emergency calls as possible ways for identifying the risks on time. The report also suggested carrying out maternal death surveillance regularly to reduce preventable deaths.The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes including free institutional delivery service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. The ministry has also distributed misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. “As the annual health budget does not help us carry out screening of mental health programmes in many places, we are starting the programme as a pilot from the Maternity Hospital,” said Shrestha. “This programme will be expanded in the coming years to other districts, as it is impossible to prevent suicide of pregnant women without treatment of mental health problems.”Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nAt least 50 health workers including medical officers, health assistants and paramedics serving in health facilities of Kathmandu district have been trained to screen patients suffering from non-communicable diseases.The Kathmandu Health Office provided the health workers with a four-day training. The trained health workers will screen major non-communicable diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health problems, among others, in patients seeking healthcare at local health facilities of the district, according to officials at the Health Office Kathmandu.“Patients seeking healthcare services at the local units of Kathmandu will be screened for non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “Health workers will prescribe medicines for non-communicable diseases, counsel patients and refer them to a tertiary care centre if the problems are complicated.”Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.The study showed that the leading risk factor of death in 2019 was smoking, whose attributable death was 17.7 percent, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution 9.3 percent, diabetes 8 percent, high cholesterol, and kidney dysfunction, among others.The Ministry of Health and Population has included medicines for non-communicable diseases in the list of 98 free essential medicines, which it provides free of cost from state-run health facilities.The free medicines on the list include medicines for some non-communicable diseases—mental health, cardiovascular, respiratory illness and diabetes, among others.Officials say that even if the burden of non-communicable diseases surpassed communicable diseases years ago and medicines for some ailments are provided free of cost, many people do not know their disease conditions due to lack of screening at health facilities.The Health Ministry in the past had decided to provide free screening for certain non-communicable diseases to people above 40 years old. However, such services have not started in many health facilities.“Trained health workers will screen the patients visiting health facilities they serve at,” said Sapkota. “We hope that patients suffering from non-communicable diseases will be diagnosed on time, which will ultimately help in lessening the burden of non-communicable diseases.”Doctors say most people do not undergo testing unless it is an emergency and also do not know if they are suffering from a serious ailment. They say that a lot of lives will be saved if testing of non-communicable diseases is made free.Public health experts say the increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases is a global phenomenon but developing countries like Nepal have been facing a double burden. \nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York, promotes Nepali cuisine through his restaurant \"The Sewing Tin,\" blending traditional flavors with modern techniques, while sharing its stories and facing challenges as an outsider in the city.\nCeleus Baral, an environment science student with a passion for baking, runs an online shop and recently started selling at The Yellow House's Night Market, emphasizing sustainable practices and infusing her creations with her artistic sensibility and love for nature.\nPotato, a versatile and nutrient-rich staple food in Nepal, flourishes despite climatic changes and is consumed in various forms, including chips and fries, but excessive consumption of fried potatoes can have adverse health effects.\nChicken eggs, a rich source of essential nutrients, are widely consumed in Nepal due to their affordability and health benefits, including weight loss, reduced blood pressure, protection against infections, and prenatal bone strengthening.\nPiano Piano South, an Italian restaurant in Lalitpur, offers a tranquil ambiance with indoor and outdoor seating, a revised menu featuring Antipasti, Platti Principali, and desserts, accompanied by a curated wine selection.\nNepal offers significant attractions including the Mundhum Trek, Janaki Mandir, Kuri Village, Annapurna Base Camp, Bardiya National Park, Khaptad National Park, and the picturesque Limi Valley, providing a diverse range of cultural and natural experiences for visitors.\nReturning to his hometown Phidim after a long absence, the author witnesses its transformation from a quaint town to a bustling transit hub, marked by a loss of opportunities that has led to an exodus of its people.\nBara Imambara, built in 1784 in Lucknow, is a historic complex featuring the Rumi Darwaza, Asafi Mosque, Asafi Hall with Asaf-ud-Daula's tomb, Bhool Bhulaiyaa labyrinth, and Shahi Baoli stepwell, showcasing architectural brilliance and Mughal-era artistry.\nNepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers in 2022, emphasizing the value of experienced trekking guides for navigating the treacherous terrains of Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu, with tips provided by Luckme Syangden and Manu Rai for the preparation, gear, and challenges encountered by female trekkers.\nFive women started Duluwa Outdoors in 2021 to inspire and enable women to travel alone in Nepal, addressing a gap in the industry and providing a space for connection and empowerment.\nTribhuvan Army Club’s Deepak Adhikari and Nepal Police Club’s Rajpura Pachhai won the men’s and women’s half-marathon titles of the 2024 Kantipur Half Marathon on Saturday.Adhikari, who was a runner-up in the 2022 edition, timed one hour seven minutes and 15 seconds to win the men’s 21.1 km race to claim his maiden Kantipur Half Marathon title.Rajpura Pachhai defended the title of the women’s 21.1 km half marathon.

Four people have been arrested, he said.The Spanish foreign ministry said that the consular emergency unit had been fully mobilised and the victims and their families were being assisted.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on social messaging platform X that he was “shocked by the news of the murder of Spanish tourists in Afghanistan”. There was no immediate indication of why the attack happened.Mountainous Bamyan is home to a UNESCO world heritage site and the remains of two giant Buddha statues which were blown up by the Taliban during their previous rule in 2001.Since taking over Afghanistan in 2021 the Taliban have vowed to restore security and encourage a small but growing number of tourists trickling into the country and sell tickets to access the Buddha statues.Friday’s attack was among the most serious targeting foreign citizens since foreign forces left and the Taliban took over in 2021.The Islamic State claimed an attack that injured Chinese citizens at a hotel popular with Chinese businessmen in Kabul in 2022. \nLai Ching-te, Taiwan’s incoming president, vows stability by maintaining the status quo with China amidst heightened military incursions and influence campaigns.\nRiots in New Caledonia have killed four, stranded Australians ration food, and prompted French police reinforcements to arrive and establish food and medicine supply teams.\nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe aspirations of multiple generations are tied to a nation’s development through experience, expertise, skill, new ideas and innovation. This lays the groundwork for a thriving society where each individual plays a vital role. For such a vision to come to fruition, it is essential to effectively utilise human resources. However, the question persists: How can a nation tap into the potential of its young workforce, ambitious achievers, learners, experienced retirees, migrant returnees and vulnerable populations primed for empowerment through education?Consider the management of police and military personnel on the verge of retirement, mainly those retiring in five years. In the past fiscal year, 5,961 police personnel chose voluntary retirement. One wonders what happens to their preparedness for combat and mindset regarding deployment after retirement and when retirement time approaches. The security mindset ingrained in police forces and militaries demands perpetual vigilance, rigorous training and an unwavering commitment to upholding public safety through proactive assessment and decisive action when required. There is a need to balance the seasoned and disciplined attributes they hone over the years.Comprehending the present challenges faced by students in Nepal is another aspect worth considering, as it can offer valuable perspectives on the employment scenario. Recent findings from the first-ever textbook audit report conducted by Education in Every Home, an organisation working on the education sector in Nepal, paint a stark picture: Only 75 percent children complete 8th grade, with a mere 27 percent advancing to 12th grade. How can the diverse youth receive the support they need from the government and society to enhance their thought processes and effectively utilise their potential when they don’t complete their education? Enhancing human resource management for those on the brink of retirement and promoting youth employment demands more than abstract notions. Practical steps are required to unite people of all ages. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and mentorship programmes is paramount. Moreover, it’s imperative to foster connections among eager learners, individuals seeking guidance and those who derive fulfilment from careers like police and military service. By valuing these professions and harnessing the spirit of youth, we can create a more dynamic and impactful community. Yet, beyond these efforts, we must explore innovative strategies to effectively manage human resources and combat unemployment. Tackling unemploymentThe unemployment problem can be tackled in two ways. First, the government can emulate the historical approach of Franklin D Roosevelt, who galvanised the “lost generation” to pioneer civilian conservation corps initiatives in forestry, flood control and infrastructure enhancements in the United States. As Homraj Acharya, a seasoned policy expert with extensive experience in US government and development projects in South Asia, contends, the Roosevelt approach left an indelible mark on the physical, psychological and employability facets of three million individuals enrolled in the programme. Their involvement in economic relief and conservation efforts offers a blueprint for modern initiatives tackling poverty and environmental concerns. Enrollees resided in camps, engaged in various projects and underwent rigorous training and education within the corps. This precedent offers a compelling model for addressing unemployment, poverty and environmental conservation.Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt’s visionary approach, Nepal could mobilise individuals nearing retirement age to establish a development brigade. This could enlist 50,000 individuals with approximately five years left until retirement, comprising 5,000 from the police force, 5,000 from the military and 40,000 from civilian sectors. The government can allocate additional funds to boost the salaries of police and military officers nearing retirement for joining the development brigade. These individuals can undertake infrastructure development, community enhancement, park innovation, river and lake clean up and conservation, road construction, solar panel installations, reforestation, herbs production and processing and unused productive land utilisation. This strategic initiative addresses unemployment and capitalises on valuable skills and expertise for national advancement. By offering meaningful employment opportunities in these sectors, Nepal can harness their skills and experience, reducing unemployment rates. This targeted approach would ensure continued workforce contribution and alleviate the financial burden on social welfare programmes, ultimately promoting more excellent economic stability and societal resilience.Second, to actively engage youth and students in meaningful work, introducing service learning—an educational approach—can inspire them to participate in community-based projects, nurturing awareness, empathy, critical thinking skills, leadership abilities, teamwork, cultural competence, communication skill and a sense of social responsibility. The mandatory service-learning project for high school students can be easily connected to the development brigade initiative, suggests Acharya. The programme, also known as community learning or experiential learning, can foster collaboration between universities, businesses, nonprofits and government entities, benefiting the local community. Through service-learning courses, students earn credits while undertaking hands-on experiences such as office work, fieldwork, journaling and reflection papers. They can expand professional networks, cultivate friendships, enhance well-being, build confidence, confirm career interests, and explore new fields of study. Introducing the concept of service learning, which can later evolve into the digital literacy brigade, can facilitate a smooth transition from acquiring practical skills to addressing unemployment for the youth and students of Nepal. As students engage in hands-on experiences during service-learning courses, they cultivate crucial skills for navigating the generational realm, enhancing employability and contributing to workforce readiness. This will ultimately benefit the country through a more skilled and capable workforce fostering economic improvement. Such initiatives provide practical solutions and promote a unified responsibility for societal progress. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and meaningful employment opportunities shall ensure that everyone, regardless of age or background, can meaningfully contribute to the nation’s advancement. By grasping the importance of intelligent human resource management and investing in the growth of citizens, Nepal can build a rock-solid base for a vibrant and challenging society. Here, every single member steps up to mould the shared future.Nepal is a development professional and co-founder of Education in Every Home. \nMore than two years after Russia invaded Ukraine, the West, remarkably, still lacks a unified strategy. Though it has supplied desperately needed weapons and ammunition, it has done little else to address Ukraine’s needs.What would an effective strategy look like? For starters, Western governments need to establish shared goals. Ukraine must expel Russian forces and recover all the territory that it has lost since 2014; Russia must be forced to pay war reparations to compensate Ukraine (the World Bank estimates that reconstruction will cost about $500 billion over the next decade); the thousands of Ukrainians who have been deported to Russia must be allowed to return; and the tens of thousands of suspected war crimes committed by Russian troops must be prosecuted and punished.The West can no longer get away with promising to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.” Rather than holding Ukraine back from attacking Russian strategic and military assets, it should welcome such strikes. Losing the war is the best thing that could happen to Russia. Historically, military defeats have usually led to reforms and a change in leadership – as happened after the Crimean War (1853-56), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), and the war in Afghanistan (1979-88). Vladimir Putin has re-introduced Stalinist-level repression and opted for eternal war, a project that is likely to end in his demise. While it is ultimately up to Russians to effect regime change, the West should welcome the prospect.Many believe that Russia has the advantage in a long war, simply because its population and economy are larger than Ukraine’s (though the United States was defeated in Vietnam and Afghanistan after long wars). Whatever the case, a longer war undoubtedly will cost everyone much more. As such, the West should return to former US Secretary of State Colin Powell’s Gulf War tactic of “shock and awe” to bring about a Ukrainian victory.That means delivering all the best conventional arms to Ukraine as soon as possible, rather than continuing the current drip-feed of old weapons. Nobody can put such weapons to better use than Ukraine’s skilful soldiers. If Ukraine were to lose, Russian forces would march further into Europe to fulfil Putin’s neo-Czarist ambition of restoring the Russian Empire. Since Ukraine’s people are fighting and dying to defend Europe, the least the West can do is give them all they need to win. Denmark and the Baltic states have set an example others should follow.Specifically, the West should furnish Ukraine with potent long-range weapons—such as ATACMS and Taurus missiles—as well as a strong air force, so that it can gain supremacy over the skies. With thousands of Westerners having volunteered to fight for Ukraine on the front lines, why shouldn’t Western pilots join, too? Ukraine needs proper air defense. Absurdly, the West has made Russia, rather than Ukraine, a no-fly zone.The eminent retired US Generals Ben Hodges and Philip Breedlove have long argued that Crimea is likely to be decisive. Similarly, in the mid-nineteenth century, Pavel Nakhimov, an admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy, observed that whoever controls Sevastopol (Crimea’s largest port) controls the Black Sea. Clearly, Ukrainian control of that city should be a major strategic goal. To cut Russia off from Crimea, Ukraine also will need to destroy the Kerch Strait bridges to the peninsula.To force Russia to pay war reparations to Ukraine, the West should confiscate the $300 billion of Russian central-bank reserves that it has frozen. Canada and the US have already adopted laws authorising such a move; they should follow through, and the European Union should follow suit. It is unconscionable that Russia can violate international laws with abandon and still have its property shielded in the West. As long as the war continues, the West will need to provide Ukraine with $100 billion per year—$50 billion at least in military assistance, $40 billion to finance the civilian government, and $10 billion in humanitarian assistance.While Western sanctions on Russia have had some bite, they must be strengthened. Owing to the existing sanctions, the Russian economy has not grown since 2014, and its export revenues fell by 26 percent last year. But to tighten sanctions further, all Western governments should impose prohibitive tariffs on all imports from Russia—as the EU is currently doing with respect to Russian agricultural goods. Western countries have already rescinded Russia’s most-favoured-nation status, and bounded tariffs permitted by the World Trade Organization are very high. Since Western countries trade so little with Russia, higher tariffs will no longer have any meaningful impact on their domestic inflation. And since the customs system functions well, enforcement problems would be minimised.During the Cold War, Western governments cooperated through the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom), headquartered in Paris. That body should be restored to ensure more effective control over sensitive exports to Russia. Personal sanctions also need to be coordinated, reinforced, and streamlined. All sanctioning jurisdictions should agree on similar rules, impose the same sanctions, and exchange classified information about the reasons for them.Meanwhile, Russians who condemn the war and withdraw from Russia should be delisted in all jurisdictions. Secret ownership in the West by sanctioned oligarchs should no longer be tolerated. Similarly, the West needs to start thinking about how to penalise Western companies that continue to work in Russia and support the Russian government with taxes and other benefits. One reasonable idea is that they be forced to pay penal taxes commensurate to what they pay to Russia.Finally, the EU should start accession negotiations with Ukraine, and NATO should use its 75th anniversary summit in Washington in July to extend a formal membership invitation to Ukraine. A large majority of NATO members already supported doing so at last year’s summit in Vilnius. There is no reason not to follow through this year as part of a broader unified Western strategy.-Project Syndicate \nThe three branches of the government function through a system of check and balance. When one of the executive, the legislative or the judicial branches exceeds its bounds, the others remind it of its constitutional limits. In the post-1990 democratic setup, the judiciary for one has by and large played a positive role in upholding democratic values that had repeatedly come under assault, particularly by the executives who refused to accept any limits on their powers. Yet of late some questionable verdicts of the top court in the country have raised the spectre of a ‘judicial supremacy’. On May 3, a division bench of the Supreme Court raised many eyebrows when it ruled that the Speaker of the Gandaki Provincial assembly should not be counted as an assembly member in the government formation process. So, in the 60-member assembly, even 30 members could constitute a majority. Back in March 2021, in a highly unanticipated decision, deciding what was essentially a petition challenging the party’s name, the court dissolved the ruling Nepal Communist Party. A couple of months later, the court even appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba the new prime minister. As there are disputes on government formation in nearly each of the seven provinces, the Supreme Court could time and again be asked to settle them, just like in Gandaki. That is not all. The decision on judging the legality of the recent split of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also now rests with the top court. What we repeatedly see is that the court is being asked to rule on what are essentially political disputes. If there was even a minimum level of understanding among our major political actors, many of the disputes in the provinces could have been settled among themselves. In other words, it is our major political actors who are inviting judicial activism. This in turn undermines the credibility of the judiciary. Yet that is only one worry. If our political actors continue to turn to the courts to handle all major and minor political disputes, then we should not be surprised if the third branch of the state starts acting more and more arbitrarily. There is then also the risk of the courts being cooped by other power centres, as is the case, say, in our neighbouring Pakistan or Myanmar. In order to uphold its image as a neutral interpreter of the constitution and other laws, the judiciary could do its bit by declining to hear cases of certain nature that are best decided through political dialogue, or through healthy discussions in the sovereign parliament. Our political actors should also learn to act more maturely. Yes, the kind of electoral system the country has is unlikely to ensure a high level of political stability. Yet our politicians cannot get away by putting all the blame on the system. They too must learn to show at least a minimum level of political maturity. Again, the democratic system only works through check and balance. If one organ of the state forgets its duties, the whole system destabilises.   \nAfter a months-long heatwave, the recent rainfall in Nepal brought much-needed relief and helped put out wildfires. Unfortunately, the rainwater, coupled with warmth, also created a favourable environment for dengue-carrying mosquitoes. As a result, dengue cases are already on the rise, with 57 districts reporting dengue infection, and over 50 cases were reported in a single week. Experts believe the worst is yet to come. Even though dengue has taken many lives in the past few years (20 deaths in 2023, 88 in 2022 and six in 2019) and infected many (52,000 in 2023, 54,000 in 2022 and 16,000 in 2019), it remains the most neglected virus. Authorities seem to care little either about its spread or severity. Nor do they try to understand the changing nature of the virus from climate change and rising temperatures through research and tests. A Dengue Action Plan is in place, but the government hasn’t been able to do enough to contain the spread of the virus except relying on traditional methods like surveillance of the virus, serotyping of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes, plus treatment, management and collaboration with local levels. Even the action plan acknowledges that the country’s dengue spread has gone out of hand, making it difficult to contain. Nepal is unable to undertake year-round surveillance and prevention programmes due to budgetary limits. The action plan clearly states that there’s no budget to deal with dengue throughout the year. This was bound to happen as the health ministry’s budget was reduced this fiscal year, discontinuing many programmes. Moreover, even the budget allocated for a particular fiscal year (for example in 2022-23) is used up before March/April, when cases usually surge. These months, as experts suggest, are crucial, as stopping the spread of the virus just when the cases are rising is the most effective way to cut down on the number of deaths and infections throughout the year. Apart from insufficient budget, the country also lacks entomologists, and no other ministry is held responsible for the work except health.The situation will only worsen the longer these challenges are overlooked. And removing the dengue menace should not be the sole responsibility of the health ministry. The finance ministry should allocate enough budget to drive dengue prevention measures for a whole year; the environment ministry can implement environmental policies to control the breeding sites of mosquitoes, and urge people to maintain sanitation and proper waste management; the urban development ministry must manage drainage systems and green spaces; while the transportation ministry needs to prevent the accumulation of stagnant water on roads. Only such a collective measure will help reduce dengue dangers.While continuing with awareness programmes, door-to-door campaigns and search-find-destroy drives should also be pushed on a regular basis. There is a strong case for learning from other countries. For instance, eDengue systems implemented in Malaysia could be used to report cases from rural parts of Nepal and detect severe cases for timely medical intervention. The onus is also on the public to take preventive measures on a year-round basis. Again, dengue is not something that only the government can control. If we don’t work together, many of us will needlessly suffer.  \nSenior leaders from seven major political parties—both the ruling as well as opposition forces—on Sunday made an unequivocal collective pledge to make maximum effort to promote the country’s investment and business climate. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, CPN (Maoist Centre) vice-chair Pampha Bhusal, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden, Rastriya Swatantra Party Chief Whip Santosh Pariyar, CPN (Unified Socialist) General Secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal and Janamat Party chair CK Raut, while airing their respective party’s views at the Kantipur Economic Summit-2024, also emphasised the need for the political forces and other stakeholders to work hand in hand in order to attract investment.It was just two weeks ago that top leaders of the country including Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepali Congress and KP Sharma Oli, chair of a major coalition partner CPN-UML, while addressing the two-day Investment Summit, committed to spare no effort to turn Nepal into an investment-friendly destination. Presenting Nepal as a country of huge potential, the leaders made the promises before 1,600-plus representatives from 55 countries in the government-organised summit. Realisation of the need for domestic as well as foreign investments and joint political commitments of rival political forces in itself is a positive gesture.However this is not enough. Nepal’s politicians have time and again made such promises but failed to translate them into results. For that, Nepal still needs political as well as policy stability and predictability. Various countries have made tremendous progress even when there is instability in government leadership. They did so by keeping development activities separate from politics and ensuring policy predictability, even if there are constant changes in governments. One big concern of the representatives from the business communities expressed at the Kantipur Economic Summit was the same. They said genuine investors seek policy predictability as a prerequisite before making a sizable investment. This is a valid concern and the policy makers must ensure so much.Yet the initiatives of the government and our politicians appear more superficial than substantive. Just ahead of the investment summit, the government amended some Acts through an ordinance to clear legal complexities for investment. It was the government’s intent to create an impression before the international participants that Nepal is serious about getting money from abroad. But the ordinances couldn’t be tabled in the first meeting of the House of Representatives on Friday due to the ongoing obstruction of the main opposition party Nepali Congress. There is a prolonged deadlock in Parliament. The ruling and opposition parties are in a face-off over a parliamentary panel to probe Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The minister is accused of involvement in multiple cooperative frauds. The House obstruction by the main opposition over the demand first made in the winter session has continued even after the commencement of the budget session on May 10. If our political parties cannot even come together to pass the national budget, it would be hard for foreigners to trust us with their money. The only way Nepal will attract quality investment and make a leap in its development endeavour is through a collective political effort to ensure policy consistency. For the country’s larger good, they must also be able to see beyond their partisan interests.  \nAs the midsummer mercury rises, storing fresh food remains a challenge. In a country where the usage of refrigerators remains limited to urban areas, there is a risk of food getting contaminated. Moreover, our general attitude towards food safety and preservation, especially in eateries, is casual. For instance, we see meat shops openly displaying raw meat items all day on tables and showcases, without the use of freezers. Sweet shops and restaurants are no better, as they are tempted to display their food items to attract customers. Even though the food might look appealing to our eyes when it is served in eateries, it is ultimately harmful to our health as many do not follow the proper food safety protocols. The open display of food items invites bacteria and dust contamination, apart from the obvious heat-related hazards, leading to the onslaught of various diseases, including cholera and food poisoning, apart from a lack of nutrition. Although Nepal has food safety regulations in place, the lack of implementation and monitoring continues to pose the risk of food-borne diseases to the public. The Food Act, 2023 (1967) prohibits the production, sale or distribution of adulterated foodstuff or sub-standard foodstuff. By adulterated foodstuff, the Act means \"foodstuffs rotten so as to be harmful to health, or prepared or kept in a filthy or toxic condition\". In January last year, Nepal implemented a new set of food safety regulations, which has provisions for the careful production, processing, packaging, handling, storage and supply purity of food. The regulations also have provisions for labelling the food, including its nutritional value.However, apart from poor implementation of such regulations, the monitoring of the regulations is almost non-existent. In rare instances when food inspectors from municipalities bother to monitor the food in eateries, there is a high chance of such eateries being found flouting the regulations. For instance, in Kathmandu, as in most parts of the country, food items, especially items like meat that get contaminated quickly, are laid out in the open and sold. This causes great health risks, but the authorities of all levels of government seem either oblivious to or uninterested in the issue. In Kathmandu Metropolitan City, for instance, the authorities' focus is on removing the food vendors altogether, guided by a flawed notion of gentrification rather than regulating them under tax and food safety regimes. In other parts of the country, hardly anyone bothers to check the quality of food provided to customers.The state cannot remain a mute spectator when the health of the citizens is put at risk due to the carelessness of vendors. Rather, the state should strictly maintain food safety standards regularly—not in an episodic pattern, such as during festivals or at the whims of authorities but as a standard practice. Some basic steps include making it mandatory for vendors to keep appropriate food items in freezers, use covering, and segregate food items to avoid cross-contamination. As the culture of eating out is becoming increasingly common, especially among young people, the state should actively enforce food preservation and safety regulations to keep the citizens healthy. \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   \nThe budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nPeople lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. \nThe third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit starts today. At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal. \nPolitical parties’ unhealthy activities to form provincial governments has taken the form of an ugly competition and increased the public’s frustration with the provinces. Separately, leaders of major political parties have started to blame the mixed electoral system for Nepal’s perpetual instability. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to political analyst Tula Narayan Shah to discuss these and other related issues.Nepali politics has entered yet another phase of endless bickering over power after the March 4 change of the ruling coalition. Politicians have resorted to every possible tactic to get leadership in provincial governments. How do you analyse this trend?I am not surprised. It is natural in the kind of parliamentary system that we practise. We adopted the parliamentary model in federal and provincial levels while the one at our local level is similar to the presidential system. Local unit chiefs and deputies are elected directly by the people and they can serve five-year terms. That has ensured stability there. Provincial governments on the other hand are destabilised when there is any change at the centre.Leaders have started blaming the electoral system for hung parliaments and instability. Is the problem in the system or with our leaders?Some senior leaders in major parties now blame the electoral system. Even the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Office of the Auditor General have recommended changes in the electoral model, arguing that the current one had promoted corruption in the country. I am not convinced. Politicians argue that no political party could garner a majority in this system and that led to instability. I rather hold politicians’ personal ambition and corrupt political culture responsible. General secretary of a major political party recently argued that it will be better for national politics to be driven by two political parties. Nepal conducted eight general elections (in 1959, in 1991, in 1994, in 1999, in 2008, in 2013, in 2017 and in 2022) under a multi-party system. Forget the 1959 polls. Of the three polls held in the 1990s, the Nepali Congress got majority in 1991 and 1999. Also, during those years, two parties—the Congress and the CPN-UML—dominated Nepali politics. Did a single-party majority and dominance of two parties provide stability? Not at all. Rather, personal rivalries of the Congress leaders invited instability. Fast forward to 2017 elections. The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance and jointly fought elections. They later merged to form the Nepal Communist Party, which had a comfortable majority. Again the rivalry of the top leaders within the party caused instability. These instances show that a majority for a single party doesn’t necessarily translate into stability.I rather see a conspiracy behind blaming the electoral system. In the 1990s, Nepal adopted the first-past-the-post system to elect all lawmakers. Around 70 percent national seats were controlled by two castes—Brahmin and Chhetri. In 2008, we adopted a mixed electoral system, which was a demand of the 2006 people’s movement, the Maoist insurgency and the Madhesh agitation. The proportional representation category significantly increased representation of women, dalits, Madheshi and indigenous communities in the legislature, whereas the representation of the males of Khas-Arya groups, who were historically ruling the country, decreased drastically.Who are those elected the most under the FPTP system?The FPTP electoral system has certain attributes that are more conducive to some groups than others. ‘High-caste males’ win more elections. Females have less of a chance. But dalits also have less chance even if the candidate is male. Those like contractors, landlords and businesspeople who can freely spend win elections. Likewise, those who are well-connected with the power centres in Kathmandu can influence elections. Chhetris and Thakuris were dominant in Panchayat politics. Brahmins got stronger after the 1990 political change. Also those who have access and visibility in media and other public forums have better chances of being elected under the FPTP.Some leaders who have these capabilities have won elections in different systems. There is one Madheshi leader, who won election in Panchayat, got tickets from Congress and won again in the multiparty system. Later he joined a Madhesh-based party and won. So, high-caste males and those with access to power corridors in Kathmandu want FPTP. Whereas, women, dalits and those from marginalised communities prefer PR.A general perception is that those who are directly elected are competent ones and can deliver whereas those from the PR category are there just for the sake of representation. Do you agree?Leaders didn’t pick the candidates properly under the PR category. They picked their loved or loyal ones or sold these seats for hefty monetary returns. Leaders from Madheshi and indigenous communities fought for this system. But the same Madheshi leaders kept the names of their wives, daughters and other family members at the top of the PR list. Thus leaders misused and defamed the electoral system. So, the debate should be focused on correcting the wrong practices, not scrapping the system itself.Provinces replicated all the wrong practices of the centre and did even worse.We adopted the same parliamentary system in provinces. So the same thing happened there. Conversely, local units are different as the system there is different. Therefore, we have to go for directly elected executive heads at the centre as well as provinces. Let’s elect the prime minister and chief ministers directly. That will give us stability. Senior leaders from the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre have proposed changing the electoral system but they haven’t proposed direct election of the prime minister and chief ministers. So, the solution is direct election of executive heads, as in Palikas. Scrapping of the PR system won’t help.What if a wrong person gets elected to the post and can’t be removed for five years?In a democracy, you have to trust the people. Nepali citizens are the ones who removed monarchy. Can’t they unseat a leader elected by their votes? In a direct election, even a person from outside the political parties may emerge. So, politicians are afraid because traditionally they exert control over candidacy and various other things through the parties. Many think of provinces as an unnecessary burden on state coffers. Is that the case?I don’t think so. State restructuring was one of the major demands of the Maoist insurgency, Madhesh movement and the 2006 People’s Movement. Why did they ask for it? Because Nepal was a heavily centralised state and it wasn’t inclusive. Federalisation of the state, inclusive electoral system and reservation quotas in civil service were the three components of state restructuring.But why did the provinces then fail to deliver and win public trust?The stakeholders spent around a decade deciding what type of provinces should be carved out. Even pro-federalists didn’t debate how to make the provinces functional. Those who lobbied in favour of the federal system have now become defensive. Some are silent. The political party [which is led by Upendra Yadav] that fought for the federal system has been leading the government in Madhesh for the past six years. But they haven’t given any relief to the common people through the provincial government. People have an impression that the provincial system has added corruption and it is only for the leaders and their cronies, not the common people.Are the leaders really corrupt or do they lack efficiency?Even the Maoist and Madheshi parties that promised to be different to the Congress and the UML couldn’t come up with a roadmap to make the federal system and state agencies more meaningful for the people. They only indulged in power politics, just like other parties. That frustrated the people.You recently travelled to various parts of Madhesh province. How are the sub-national administrations working and what is the public mood there?A society where people are aware, educated and active helps make leaders as well as administration accountable. Authorities are found to be working arbitrarily in the places where people can’t question their wrongdoing. We find relatively better administration in the mid-hill regions, where Brahmins and Chhetris have dominant presence as they have better understanding of the system, laws and other information. Such a mid-hill area expands from the eastern border to Lumbini Province. In this belt, people can raise questions and make the administration accountable. Women’s status is better while caste-based discrimination is less. Local units, schools, health posts, and administrative units work well. Conversely, these aspects are weak in Karnali, Sudurpaschim, inner Madhesh and in the northern belt as there is no critical mass capable of questioning the authorities.You should understand that there are two Madhesh belts. One is along the East-West Highway, second is the bordering area. The belt along the highway has a diverse social composition. There is dominance of the people who migrated from the hills. Development indicators are better and so is the presence of state agencies. The more you move south, the more you find homogenous populations of Madheshi origin. Traditional power relations haven’t changed there. Patron-client dynamics still stand. Certain individuals have key roles in elections and other important activities. They take the decision on behalf of other common people. We find similar practice in the northern belt as well but not in the mid-hill and highway areas.Many say local units perform better than provinces. What is the perception on the ground?Local level is equipped with needed authority. Provinces should be given powers to make them effective as per the spirit of federalism. The present system was designed by reluctant federalists. Therefore, what we need is a fresh debate on the reforms of provinces. There are two conflicting claims. A section of the society says provinces have misused their authority and failed to deliver. Others say the provinces need more authority for effective functioning.It is true that provinces have failed to use the authority they have. Provinces have their legislatures that prepare their budgets and their governments can implement it. Give me an example of an exemplary and innovative initiative taken by any of the seven provinces in the past six years. Madhesh Province started the ‘Beti Padhau Beti Bachau’ campaign but corruption doomed it. People started raising questions, “why do we need provinces, if the leaders there are to copy the same corrupt activities of the centre?”Madheshi leaders opposed the hill people’s dominance and discriminatory practices in the central administration. But the same Madheshi leaders aren’t promoting an inclusive system in Madhesh. Around 20 percent of the total Madhesh population are dalits. The government in the province has changed multiple times. But how many dalits have been ministers in the provincial Cabinets? There are 136 local units in Madhesh Province. But only one mayor and two deputy-mayors are from the dalit community. Just like a set of elite people has captured Kathmandu’s politics, another set of elites has captured the politics of Janakpur.How do Madheshi people look at provinces?People in Kathmandu, mid-hills, and some other places can be heard saying provinces should be scrapped. Common people in Madhesh don’t say so. But they have dissatisfaction with the parties who championed the federal system. They say, “our lives are the same even in the federal system”.How do you analyse the performance of two new parties in Madhesh—Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti?Overall, three parties emerged from the 2022 elections. The Rastriya Swatantra Party emerged from the areas with a dominant presence of hill people. The Janamat Party won from eastern Tarai and the Nagarik Unmukti Party from the western part of the southern belt. The Janamat says the agenda of discrimination against Madhesh is still relevant but they oppose the leadership of the Janata Samajbadi Party and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The old Madheshi parties spoke against Kathmandu’s discrimination but they themselves didn’t work to remove discrimination when they led the government in Madhesh. Besides, they didn’t speak against bad governance. Now, the Janamat’s agenda is to fight discrimination and bad governance, both by Kathmandu as well as the old Madheshi parties.The RSP’s emergence is against “the bad governance of the Congress and the UML”. Its major agenda is good governance. It doesn’t care about discrimination. But bad governance isn’t an agenda of Nagarik Unmukti. The party that emerged mainly after the Tikapur incident is against the discrimination of Tharu community. The dispute in the party is family-based and the outfit hasn’t taken the form of a political party. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nOur attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email \nWe understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal \nI am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25). I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London \nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nOn Friday, 55-year-old Shanti Devi Yadav of Janakpur was having her snacks in front of a community building at Aanptari Chowk in Narayanghat, Chitwan. Shanti Devi arrived in Narayanghat on the 19th day of walking all the way from her home for a cause. She is a member of the 22-member team that is marching from Bhardaha of Saptari district to Kathmandu to save the Chure region from illicit activities. The team is marching under the banner of Chure and Forest Conservation Campaign.The Chure range features a string of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west along the south of the Mahabharat hills. The range is around 20-30 km wide and 1,000 km long. Natural sources of water originating from the foothills of Chure are gradually drying up in the last few years, causing depletion of the first layer of the underground water in Bhawar (the area between Chure and the Tarai) and Tarai, experts say.The campaigners started the long march on April 28 in a bid to exert pressure on authorities concerned about the unchecked deforestation and haphazard extraction of sand and stones in the Chure region, which has resulted in an acute water crisis in Tarai.The campaigners, who walk around 35 to 40 kilometres daily, are on their way to Kathmandu, the national capital. They are scheduled to organise a sit-in at Maitighar, Kathmandu, to bring to light the worsening situation of Chure region.In Shanti Devi’s house in Pulchowk, Janakpur, a hand pump has been running dry at the start of March for the past seven years. “It neither rains in the winter nor in April/May,” Shanti Devi said. “Our settlement is facing a water crisis.”Nanda Mukhiya, aged 58, of the same settlement strongly believes they should put pressure on the government for a solution to the longstanding problem. Nanda is not well, yet he is more worried about the impending environmental crisis that the future generations will have on their hands rather than about his frail health.“I set off on the long march with a cache of medicines in order to preserve our water sources,” Nanda said. “Wells, ponds and hand pumps started drying up in the area. Our life in Madhesh is now difficult.”Sunil Yadav, the central coordinator of the Chure and Forest Conservation Campaign, said water sources in Tarai started drying up due to the destruction of Chure region. He claims that the government, all three levels of it, and the concerned authorities are not bothered about controlling unchecked deforestation in the Chure and Madhesh regions.Sunil, a permanent resident of Simraungadh Municipality-2 in Bara district, had worked in a motorcycle workshop in Kalaiya until eight years ago. He used to read news and articles on the deforestation in Chure region, its impacts and possible solutions. “I realised that there will be a crisis in Madhesh unless the rampant deforestation in Chure is not controlled,” he said.The campaign has launched the long march with a 12-point charter of demands. The campaigners ask for strong action against the forest officers who work hand in glove with smugglers, control of illegal extraction of river-bed materials from the rivers and streams in the Chure region, declaration of Madhesh as a dry zone, and concrete plans to control forest fires. They also demand that Dilip Mahato, an environmental activist who was killed for raising his voice against illegal extraction of sand and pebble, be declared the country’s first conservation martyr.Twenty-four-year-old Mahato, who had been protesting against illegal mining of Aurahi riverbed material, was dragged and killed by a tipper truck in the wee hours on 10 January, 2020.The campaign had organised a similar long march to Kathmandu last year demanding control of the pollution of the Sirsiya river that flows through Birgunj, a major business and industrial hub in Parsa district of Madhesh Province. The campaigners met high level government officers and ministers in Kathmandu. “The then home minister and industry minister had assured us they’d take initiatives for the control of water pollution in the river,” Sunil said. “But nothing has happened yet.”The Sirsiya river has become highly polluted due to the toxic industrial waste generated by several factories on the Parsa-Bara Industrial Corridor. The factories release untreated waste into the river, locals say, resulting in the waterway turning into an open sewer.In its 12-point demand, the campaign has included the issue of Sirsiya River this time as well. “The government does not have a suitable policy on the posting and transfer of forest officials. Some officers stay in the same area for years under political protection. They support smugglers instead of taking strong action against them,” said Sunil, urging all to join hands for the conservation of the Chure region.Of the 22 members in the long march, 13 are women. The long march will conclude after reaching Maitighar, Kathmandu, in a few days. The campaigners said they will launch an hour-long sit-in every day in front of the party office of major political parties and submit the 12-point memorandum.“This march is not for an individual,” Shanti Devi said, as she continued having her snack. “Despite hardships, I decided to participate to protect our society and the whole nation from an impending environmental crisis.” \nThe Ministry of Health and Population plans to install an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountainous districts, aiming to lessen postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort using an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.“Deaths of new mothers and newborn babies are high due to hypothermia [a condition that occurs when the body’s core temperature drops below 35°C] in the mountain regions,” said Dr Gauri Shrestha, chief of the Safe Motherhood Programme of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We hope that floor heating systems at birthing centres will help in reducing these deaths.”Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The report of the nationwide study shows that 21 children in every 1,000 live births die within a month. The figure was the same in 2016.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.Likewise, the report shows that as of 2022, in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications in Nepal. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016, for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.Every year, hundreds of women in the country succumb to preventable deaths, which include hypothermia, according to maternal health experts.Officials at the Family Welfare Division said they have proposed allocating the required amount in the new budget for the upcoming fiscal year.Floor heating systems will be set up in birthing centres of Solukhumbu, Tehrathum, Ramechhap and Sindhupalchok districts, Shrestha said. “This would be good to have in birthing centres of other districts as well but a slash in the health budget does not support an extension of the programme.”The health ministry has decided to start several programmes, including a ‘special newborn care unit’, in all district hospitals nationwide to reduce newborn deaths.For that, it has started training doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in the district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.Similarly, several measures have been taken to curb maternal deaths, including the distribution of non-pneumatic anti-shock garments.The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment is a low-cost first-aid device that limits persistent postpartum bleeding. The technology applies external pressure to a woman’s lower body to drive the blood flow upwards.Experts say the device reduces blood flow to the uterus and treats hypovolemic shock, an emergency condition in which a severe loss of blood or other fluids makes the heart unable to pump enough blood to the body. The special suit can keep a woman with postpartum bleeding alive for up to 48 hours. Without the suit, the woman may bleed out within 30 minutes. The device buys critical time to transfer a patient to a healthcare facility and provide her treatment. It is also lightweight, washable and can be reused, officials said.Excessive bleeding during or after childbirth is a major cause of maternal deaths in Nepal, which the authorities have been struggling to lessen for years. It is the largest direct cause of maternal mortality worldwide and is responsible for more than a quarter of the 300,000 estimated deaths each year. \nIn his political document, Ghanashyam Bhusal, general secretary of the ruling CPN (Unified Socialist), has described capitalism as the major obstacle in achieving prosperity and socialism in the country. Bhusal emphasises his party’s goal as establishing Nepal as a socialist society in his document that he will present at the party's 10th general convention scheduled to be held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 4.Bhusal, who is praised as a socialist thinker by many, states in the paper that socialism has been the goal of all thinkers, philosophers, sages and social reformers in history inspired by human ideals.The Constitution of Nepal, which is a compromise document of major political forces such as Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, CPN (Maoist Centre), Madhes-based regional forces and other fringe parties, defines Nepal as a ‘socialism-oriented’ country.However, some left-leaning commentators didn’t buy his argument. Dambar Khatiwada, a political analyst, said that Nepali politicians, mainly communist leaders, often try to advocate a “redundant political philosophy”. He argued such a tendency has rather restricted Nepal from progressing in a true sense.“They first need to define what capitalism means before criticising it,” Khatiwada told the Post.For Khatiwada, socialism is a political philosophy, whereas capitalism is the reality. “Should we live in fantasy or reality?” he said. “They must be clear about this at first.”Bhim Bhurtel, an expert on political economy, describes Bhusal’s statement on socialism and capitalism as rebranding the old philosophy with new rhetoric, “which is meaningless”.“The philosophical understanding of our communist leaders is like a vehicle driven by a novice,” Bhurtel told the Post. “Their statements presented in such party meetings and conventions don’t have any meaning because they don’t implement the same policies when they are in the government.”Bhusal has proposed a ‘progressive parliament and a corruption-free party linked to production’ in his political document.In the 24-page report, Bhusal claimed that this was the path to be followed by most of Nepal's Communists and Marxists.While analysing political and economic life, one can see the challenges it has posed to the revolution, reads his report. “Crony capitalism has determined the general conditions of our economic life today, while parliamentary democracy has determined the general conditions of our political life.”Bhusal has presented his arguments to prove the relevance of their move to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) by splitting the country’s largest communist party, the CPN-UML, in 2021.He said the party was formed with an aim to develop it as one of the country's leading political forces.“Our party was established with an objective to revive a genuine communist movement after serious ideological, theoretical and organisational deviation seen in the CPN-UML,” reads Bhusal’s political document.The CPN-UML split in 2021 after a prolonged factional feud between the establishment faction led by party chair KP Sharma Oli and the dissident side led by former prime ministers Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal.The political document presented by the party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal in the politburo and central committee meeting held on May 15 severely criticised the mother party, the CPN-UML.In the political document to be presented in the 10th general convention of the party, Unified Socialist chair Nepal has dubbed the UML “a right-wing opportunistic party”. “UML is a party that does not hesitate to destroy the constitution and democracy,” the document reads.In his 57-page document, Nepal tries to justify the party split.Then prime minister KP Sharma Oli had dissolved the previous Parliament twice. Oli’s unconstitutional move was one of the reasons for the party’s split as the dissident faction led by Nepal and Khanal strongly opposed Oli’s move. \nOver a month since its formation, the committee to select candidates for chairpersons and members of the two transitional justice commissions has yet to start its work.A Cabinet meeting on April 12 constituted a five-member committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former chief justice, to nominate the candidates for both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. Four of the members were picked by the government, while the National Human Rights Commission chairperson or any member he recommends is also on the panel.The constitutional rights watchdog, however, has refused to send its member saying that it needs a time-bound commitment from the government to endorse a bill to amend the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act.“We have not held a single meeting so far. I don’t think the committee will commence its work until the human rights commission sends its representative,” Arjun Karki, a committee member, told the Post.The committee was constituted last month despite reservations from the conflict-era victims of human rights violation and the human rights defenders who demanded an amendment to the Act before selecting the office bearers. The government, however, said formation of the committee was necessary as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.Following the court’s order, the victims and the human rights defenders demanded the government and the parties endorse the bill to amend the Act by the top court’s deadline before starting the selection process. However, the amendment bill couldn’t be endorsed within the deadline, prompting the government to form a committee based on the existing law.Following the committee’s formation, the victims and human rights defenders requested the government to halt the selection process until the Act is amended. They also urged the national rights watchdog to refrain from sending its representative.“Amending the Act is a pre-requisite to deciding on the transitional justice process. It is good that the selection committee is dormant now,” Suman Adhikari, founding chairperson of the Conflict Victims Common Platform, told the Post. “I hope the National Human Rights Commission doesn’t deviate from its stand.”There has been no discussion on the bill that is under consideration of the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of Parliament ever since a change in the ruling alliance on March 4. The Nepali Congress, which maintained that the bill must be endorsed through a vote when it was in government, has changed its stance after being pushed to the opposition side.The two commissions have been inactive since July 2022 after the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government had claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022 and the appointments be made based on the revised Act.However, nearly two years later, nothing has been achieved as the parties are split on several provisions of the bill. The truth commission has received 63,718 complaints while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases.“We have seen what types of people it selected the last time. I don’t understand why a tested and failed person has again been picked to make the recommendations,” said Adhikari.Stakeholders have also demanded consultations before any decision on the transitional justice process is made. However, the Mishra-led panel was formed without informing victims and human rights defenders. \nAfter weeks-long uncertainty following parliamentary obstruction and negotiations to open it, the ruling and opposition parties on Saturday agreed to form a parliamentary panel to probe the cooperative scam. The main opposition Nepali Congress had been obstructing the House since last month demanding a parliamentary probe into Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the cooperatives scam. Lamichhane’s name has been linked with several cooperatives based in Pokhara, Butwal and Chitwan. According to reports, he had taken millions of rupees from the three cooperatives. A meeting of the ruling and opposition parties held at the prime minister’s residence on Saturday evening agreed to form such a parliamentary probe panel whose terms of reference could be finalised on Sunday, according to the leaders present at the meeting. With this development, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s plan to take a vote of confidence on Monday will go ahead smoothly, said leaders. The formation of the parliamentary panel and understanding on the terms of reference will also pave the way for the resumption of the parliamentary proceedings and unveiling of the government’s annual budget on May 28. The meetings of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly will resume from Sunday, Padam Giri, the minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, told the Post.According to Giri, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who was demanding time to speak in the House and clarify his position on the allegations against him in the cooperatives scam, will speak at Sunday’s House meeting. Nepali Congress, which was preventing the home minister from speaking in the House, agreed to let Lamichhane speak and clarify his position on his alleged role in the cooperative funds embezzlement.According to a Congress leader, the name of Home Minister Lamichhane will not be mentioned in the ToR but the names of the cooperatives where he allegedly embezzled deposits will be stated. The party had been demanding a probe focused on Lamichhane. “We took this decision at the prime minister’s repeated requests in order to break the prolonged House deadlock. This will help with the tabling of various bills and in bringing the budget. Most importantly, this will foil [CPN-UML chair] Oli’s plan to dissolve the House and take the country into midterm polls,” the Congress leader said.“That is why we showed flexibility. The ToR of the proposed task force will now include the names of the cooperatives whose funds were embezzled by Lamichhane and his partners when he ran a television company,” said the leader.Though the Congress and other opposition parties had been demanding a parliamentary panel, the key ruling parties, the UML and the Rastriya Swatantra Party, were strongly against it.Ramesh Lekhak, chief whip of the Nepali Congress, said the meeting of the top leaders of the major political parties discussed the resumption of the House and a breakthrough was eventually made.“Now we all agree on the parliamentary committee’s formation. This is a positive development ... The law minister will coordinate the task force,” Lekhak said after the meeting.Leaders of ruling and opposition parties decided to form a four-member task force to prepare the ToR of the parliamentary committee. Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Minister Padam Giri from the UML, the party’s chief whip Mahesh Bartaula, and Shisir Khanal from the Rastriya Swatantra Party are its members, according to Lekhak. “We will try our best to conclude the ToR by Sunday evening when the task force convenes its first meeting,” Khanal told the Post. Giri represents the government, while three other leaders represent ruling and opposition parties. But there is no representation from CPN (Maoist Centre), the prime minister’s party.“I have called the first meeting of the taskforce at 8:00 am on Sunday. I am trying to finalise the TOR tomorrow itself,” Giri told the Post.Attending the Saturday meeting, which came at the initiative of Prime Minister Dahal, were Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, UML chair KP Sharma Oli, Home Minister Lamichhane and second-rung leaders of various parties.On Saturday, Speaker Devraj Ghimire had advised Prime Minister Dahal and UML’s Oli to reach an agreement with the Congress by Sunday afternoon.“If the House session does not resume by Sunday, the government will be forced to bring the budget through an ordinance,” Ghimire had said at a function earlier on Saturday. “So I have urged the top leaders to come to a conclusion at the earliest.” Ghimire has called the House meeting for 11:00 am on Sunday. “We will try to draft the ToR before the House meeting,” said Lekhak. On Saturday morning, Prime Minister Dahal met Congress leaders and later Speaker Ghimire, Oli and Lamichhane.Hundreds of cooperatives across the country are in trouble and some three dozen large ones have been declared as crisis-ridden. Cooperative owners and management have embezzled billions of rupees deposited by millions of people. The government has been under constant pressure to heed the demands of the protesting victims of cooperatives fraud from around the country. \nInternet service providers say they are awaiting the full text of the Supreme Court’s ruling to pay the taxes they raised from the public.The service providers (ISPs) raised nearly Rs4 billion in rural telecommunications development fees and royalty charges on maintenance from the public since the fiscal year 2017-18 but did not transfer the amount to the government.The ISPs have been arguing that the former parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had ordered the fees’ waiver.On May 13, the top court scrapped the writ petition filed by Worldlink Communications and ordered the ISPs to pay the government taxes that they had raised from the public.“We will obey the Supreme Court’s verdict. As the writ petition has been scrapped, we are discussing with the Nepal Telecommunications Authority on the amount that ISPs owe to the government and the payment modality,” said Binay Bohra, owner of the Vianet internet service provider.The tug-of-war between the ISPs and the government deprived thousands of people of the service when the Indian vendor on which the ISPs rely for the Internet bandwidth suddenly severed the link for hours.On May 2, Airtel, a leading telecom provider of India, cut upstream services to Nepal after the dispute between the government and ISPs over the payment dispute remained unresolved for months. The disruption started at around 5 pm and the services were restored after around five hours.According to the Internet Service Providers Association of Nepal, Airtel provides around 70 percent of upstream services to Nepal.Airtel agreed to restore the service after the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulator, promised to sort out the payment issue ‘responsibly.’For nearly two years, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology has reiterated that unless the ISPs pay the due taxes, it will not recommend the foreign exchange to be made available by the Nepal Rastra Bank to the service providers so they can forward the payment to upstream service providers.The ISPs have not paid the charges as the erstwhile parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had a few years ago ordered the government to exempt them from taxes on non-telecom components like web service, co-location, hosted service, disaster recovery, managed service, data centre, and cloud service.Following the order, in a letter dated July 15, 2018, the licensing department of Nepal Telecommunication Authority wrote to the Inland Revenue Department requesting that internet service providers not be subjected to telecommunication charges for non-telecommunication services.The committee said that internet service providers do not have to pay royalties and Rural Telecommunications Development Fund charges for three fiscal years: 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20.But the auditor general brought the issue to light.Nepal's constitutional supreme audit body pointed out that such fees, which the ISPs have raised from the public, should not be waived and instructed recovery of the charges. Following this, the government wrote to the ISPs to clear the dues.The current Public Accounts Committee has ordered the government to recover the dues from the ISPs.Nepali ISPs owe Airtel more than $30 million (Rs4.3 billion). They defaulted on payments for upstream services a year ago.The Indian vendors also threatened to suspend services starting January 1 this year if Nepali ISPs failed to settle the outstanding dues. However, following a change in government, the issue remains unresolved.The ISPs’ annual transactions near Rs27 billion, with the government earning more than Rs9 billion in revenue under eight headers.Around 10.6 million people use the internet in Nepal through 20 ISPs in the country, including the state-owned Nepal Telecom. ISPs say they provide direct employment to more than 15,000 people. \nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives is expected to run parliamentary proceedings impartially following democratic norms. In parliamentary tradition, after being elected, the Speaker dissociates himself or herself from the party that gave the election ticket to maintain neutrality.Speakers in Nepal, however, have often run into controversies. They have also been accused of failing to maintain neutrality while conducting parliamentary business. At times, they are accused of working at the behest of the mother party.The Speaker’s role becomes crucial in minimising inter-party rivalry that often leads to a political deadlock. Some Speakers such as Daman Nath Dhungana and Subas Nembang have successfully played that role as well.The incumbent Speaker Devraj Ghimire also faces the charge of failing to demonstrate an impartial role.On Saturday, Ghimire addressed a gathering organised by a provincial chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists where he said since Parliament had been held hostage, “some measures may need to be taken”. He went on to say that the government may be forced to introduce the fiscal budget through an ordinance should the House deadlock prolong.His controversial statement came ahead of political leaders’ consultations on the day as they tried to find a way out of the impasse. Soon afterwards, Ghimire attended a meeting convened by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief.The opposition leaders have fiercely criticised the Speaker mainly after the May 16 incident when the Congress and the UML lawmakers had a scuffle during the House meeting. A UML lawmaker, Ghimire formally disassociated himself from the party after being elected the Speaker in early 2023.Experts on parliamentary affairs say Speaker candidates must be picked carefully, analysing if they can do justice to the top position of the legislature. When the Speakers are selected on the basis of their relations with party leaders, they often take decisions to suit the leaders they are grateful to.Speaker is a crucial constitutional position, former Speaker Daman Nath Dhungana told the Post. But political parties often give the post to someone from the party so as to satisfy their aspirations.On May 15, UML chair Oli hinted that as Congress lawmakers had continuously been barring Home Minister Lamichhane from speaking in the House, the situation would be changed. Congress, the main opposition party, has been disrupting the House proceedings, demanding a parliamentary inquiry against Lamichhane in his alleged connections with cooperative funds embezzlement. \"It is unacceptable to us that only the Congress speaks in the meeting. Congress is not the only party in Parliament,” Oli said at the UML parliamentary party meeting on May 15. “Home Minister Lamichhane will speak at the parliament meeting tomorrow; if not, our party will speak.”The next day, Speaker Ghimire allowed Home Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and make his statement while Congress lawmakers were already chanting slogans. Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML. Speaker Sapkota had allowed Sharma to table the bill amid obstruction from the UML.The UML also accused Speaker Sapkota of aiding the party’s split. The UML at the time had urged the Speaker to sack 14 UML lawmakers, who defected to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) under Madhav Kumar Nepal. However, the Speaker refused to formalise the UML’s decision. The UML persistently protested in Parliament demanding Sapkota’s resignation as Speaker.In January 2019, Speaker Mahara was accused of siding with the ruling party during the passage of the National Medical Education Bill, even though the Congress had contested some of the bill's clauses. Additionally, he came under fire for not allowing Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to voice his opinion in the House before inviting then-prime minister Oli to speak on the contentious Guthi Bill. Ramchandra Paudel, a former Congress leader who became the Speaker after the 1996 midterm election, even faced impeachment for his role in Parliament. An impeachment motion was registered against him on September 23, 1998, for aiding the passage of a bill amid obstructions from the main opposition UML.In principle, the Speaker shouldn’t carry forward the House business even if a single parliamentarian raises his hand, says Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who has followed Parliament for more than two decades.The Speaker has the right to marshal security personnel against a parliamentarian if they disrupt the House proceedings, but s/he cannot carry forward the House business when there is an obstruction, Thapa told the Post. \nElated after clearing the advocate licensing exam, a young lawyer—adorned in a new black suit and white shirt—walks into the Bar but is told to “be seated behind the furniture railing”. Dispirited, the person walks into a bar where the bartender says, “You can’t practice law here”. Both the Bar and the bar serve as metaphors here, but they are significant in understanding the challenges young lawyers face after years of formal education and passing the bar exams following admission to the Bar. While the Bar admits them, it does not adopt or foster them. The junior bar has always felt orphaned by the Bar; therefore, it most likely will once more renew its demand to the Nepal Bar Association (NBA) to redress the plight of young lawyers in the biennial jamboree of lawyers being held on May 17, 18 and 19.Conference of lawyersThe NBA brings together lawyers from all over Nepal for a three-day conference every two years. The biennial conference is distinct from the annual general meetings held every year. One unique feature of the NBA is that compared to some other professional associations, it disjoints the elections to choose office-bearers from the convention of lawyers. This year, the conference is centred around two themes. The first theme, “Competent Lawyers, Dignified Bar”, a trade union issue, corresponds to the NBA’s objective to increase the public’s confidence and esteem regarding law practice. The second theme, “Restructuring of the Judiciary”, aligns with the broader public interest concern to increase faith in the judiciary and enhance the independence of the court and judges. Between the two themes, there are no prizes for guessing that the first, although more important for the junior bar, will receive less consideration than the second. This is because the second theme carries with it constitutional overtones, which effortlessly capture the interest of the lawyers. Lawyers will take part in an expressive debate on a range of topics, such as the hierarchy of Bar and non-Bar judicial appointees, the rationale behind the representation of the Chief Justice in the Constitutional Council, the judiciary-executive balance in the Judicial Council, the necessity of parliamentary hearing of judges, and the judicial performance of the Constitutional Bench. The conference must furnish realistic proposals for constitutional amendments. After all, if the Bar is strengthened to protect the independence of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will, in turn, be able to protect the Constitution. Barring politicsA lawyer is entitled to be a supporter or member of a political party or hold a specific political belief. Political allegiance should not be a cause to target a lawyer, nor should it be a reason to debar or discourage them from building a practice. Lawyers’ political leanings and inclinations inherently attach them to politics. However, the political influence that people trained in law are able to exert in public affairs, because they occupy more than one-third share among the three state-political organs, inquires into the political affiliation of lawyers and their proclivities an inquisitive exercise. The election for the barkeepers of the NBA, which is held every three years, conducted by dividing the candidates into panels organised openly under the tutelage of political parties, exacerbates the politics of party division and polarisation. Therefore, the question confronting the NBA today is whether its members should “practise law” or “practise politics”. The answer is obvious: The NBA cannot be an apolitical organisation, but at the same time, the practice of law should come before the practice of politics for the members of the Bar. Hence, rather than prioritising party politics, the NBA’s primary focus should be on the welfare of lawyers, continuing legal education, increasing the professional competency of its members, meritorious (and also inclusive) standards for judicial elevations, accountability of the judges and their independence and, of course, guidance and counselling for young lawyers. If the NBA can notch significant achievements on these fronts, its elections structured in party lines might be considered excusable. A Bar Association co-opted by political parties will neither garner the public’s confidence nor encourage young lawyers to participate in the Bar’s politics. Raise the junior bar Let’s circle back to the initial topic concerning the young advocate entering the Bar. Earlier last month, the Nepal Bar Council allowed entry to approximately 950 lawyers, mostly young graduates. On the one hand, it is encouraging to see more and more students showing interest in studying law and starting a career in law each year. On the other hand, a shrinking economy, inadequate employment opportunities, uncertainty regarding the future of a legal career, and the allure to migrate abroad for better jobs and living prospects are a few factors that discourage young graduates from building legal practice.Although young law graduates acquire knowledge of law in law schools, they have little understanding of how to establish the practice of law. The intervention of the Bar becomes necessary here, especially to ease the transition for young graduates from law school knowledge to practical legal skills. For the Bar, the first task is to bring all the issues to the table and establish a connection with the latest crop of young lawyers to understand their needs and concerns. An institutionalised and active junior Bar section is positioned to fill the connection gap. The second task for the Bar, running a mentorship initiative to cultivate the professional skills of young lawyers, is far easier to conceive than execute. But there is always a place to begin. The Bar should applaud the law firms already recruiting young lawyers and providing them exposure to legal practice. In addition, the Bar has to take the initiative to create a platform to bring together different generations of lawyers for collaboration and knowledge exchange. Lastly, the Bar can leverage its relationship with other industry and professional associations to increase internship and job opportunities and hold career expos. Young lawyers are future leaders of the Bar but are also integral to the legal practice at present. The Bar cannot afford for them to fail. The NBA’s biennial conference should not be limited to a speech festival but should place young lawyers at the centre of its declarations. The responsibility of the Bar lies in ensuring that the graduates who passed out after taking the Bar examination do not pass-out from the legal profession.   \nMedia literacy empowers individuals to critically analyse the complex media landscape, enabling informed decision-making and fostering active societal participation. Unfortunately, the Government of Nepal, media houses, civil society organisations and media development organisations don’t prioritise it. As a result, media literacy is thinly referenced in our legislative framework. The Constitution of Nepal 2015 articulates the right to opinion and expression (Article 17[2a]), the right to communication (Article 19), and information (Article 27) while not mentioning the phrase. However, these provisions indirectly advocate for media literacy. Similarly, the National Mass Communications Policy 2016, without using the phrase, indirectly calls for actions promoting the same. For instance, Objective 1.1 of the National Mass Communications Policy seeks to create a civilised and prosperous society by ensuring accountable mass media based on democratic principles and the right to freedom of expression. This involves integrating media literacy through promoting access to diverse information sources and promoting critical thinking skills.Critical thinking The National Census of Nepal 2021 (2078 BS) records Nepal's literacy rate at 76.3 percent, with disparities in literacy levels among different geographic regions, castes, creeds and ethnicities. The literacy rate itself tells about the status of media literacy in Nepal.Most of the population tends to accept media information at face value, lacking the ability or inclination to analyse its content critically. A section of the population, comprising social activists, media workers, teachers, businesspersons and professionals, applies critical lenses to the media’s content. Various factors influence media content, including ownership, advertising, political ideology, philosophical inclinations, diversity of media workers, corporate interests and soft power dynamics. In research for his Master of Philosophy thesis, Govinda Dhital has written that headteachers in secondary schools demonstrate high levels of media literacy across seven dimensions: Access, retrieval, understanding, use/communication, analysis, evaluation and creativity.The audience's response and feedback to media content also serve as indicators of media literacy. However, this engagement seems to have diminished over the past decade. Interestingly, scandals and gossip about political leaders and celebrities and stories related to love, sex and failed social relationships still receive engagement from the audience, especially on social media. Notably, short, entertaining videos on platforms like TikTok often garner more interaction than in-depth investigative news reports despite the latter requiring significant resources and efforts to produce.Another indicator of the general population's critical awareness is the extent to which people file complaints about media performance. According to the Press Council Nepal’s database, 221 complaints were registered against the media in 2079-80 BS (2022-23), compared to 203 complaints registered in the PCN in 2078-79 BS (2021-22) and 192 in 2077-78 BS (2020-21).Evaluating content Most people find it challenging to evaluate the credibility and reliability of various media sources, a critical aspect of media literacy. Many are unaware of the potential biases or affiliations of media houses with corporate entities, power holders or the government. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic, individuals took health decisions based on misleading information, exemplifying the lack of source evaluation skills. This led to a surge in the acquisition of Vitamin D capsules, giloy (gurjo) herbs and turmeric.People also fail to understand media techniques like framing, editing and using language or images to manipulate or sway opinions, indicating a low level of media literacy. During the campaign for the 2022 parliamentary elections in Nepal, social media users disseminated doctored photographs of politicians and exploited out-of-context video clips to confuse voters. Additionally, a 2021 study by Media Action Nepal found that out of 49,051 news articles surveyed, 1,817 contained false or misleading information.Ownership and influenceUnderstanding the commercial and political interests that may influence media content, including recognising when content is sponsored or influenced by advertisers or special interests, is another indicator of media literacy. This, too, is low among the majority of the audience. However, social activists, media professionals, educators, businesspersons and other professionals understand this dynamic. Anecdotal evidence from my conversation with them in several parts of the country reveals that some individuals actively cross-check information from local FM stations, as they can readily identify which stations are supportive to which political parties.Formats and genresAn important aspect of media literacy involves distinguishing between various types of media content, such as news, entertainment, advertising and opinion pieces and understanding the conventions and purposes of each. Unfortunately, many individuals struggle with this distinction. For instance, there are cases where people mistake a reputable news channel for an unfamiliar YouTube channel or perceive personal social media posts from journalists as official news from their respective organisations. This confusion extends to content creators, the audience cannot tell non-professional producers from professionals. The emergence of television personalities and journalists as YouTubers has led to further confusion, with their content being taken for official programming from their former television networks.Awareness about the unique aspects of digital media, including issues related to online privacy, security, digital footprints and the spread of misinformation online, is also minimal in Nepal. Access to digital security training and tools for media outlets and content producers in Nepal is limited, leaving them vulnerable to cyber threats. Moreover, most people lack awareness about the ethical responsibilities of media producers and consumers, including privacy, consent, intellectual property and the impact of media consumption on individuals and society.Media literacy effortsDespite the government's lack of prioritisation of media literacy, a few government institutions and non-governmental organisations have taken steps to strengthen it. For instance, the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) has initiated media literacy programmes mostly tailored to journalists. The Press Council Nepal (PCN) conducts interactive programmes on digital literacy that align with its objectives. Certain municipalities have also organised media skills training programmes that incorporate media literacy. Moreover, political parties and local governments have launched initiatives to guide their members on effective media relations. Furthermore, secondary school curricula include topics such as media introduction, the importance of communication, media and entertainment, information technology, digital technology, and cyber-security. These efforts collectively contribute to bolstering media literacy across various sectors of society.It is necessary to enhance media literacy in Nepal by integrating media literacy initiatives into the legislative framework and the national plan of action, including the periodic plan. Education and training programmes on media literacy must go beyond the circle of journalists. Moreover, it is imperative to promote critical thinking skills among media consumers via targeted programmes in partnership with academic institutions, government entities and civil society organisations. \nFrom historical myths to modern femtech apps, the focus of medical products aimed at women is often profit, not well-being. For centuries, women have been bombarded with a relentless marketing push for unnecessary medical products and services that often have questionable benefits for their health.From Victorian-era manuals promising control over a baby's sex to the booming modern-day female technology or femtech app market, the focus seems to be on creating a market of \"worried well\" women rather than addressing genuine health concerns.Women are known to spend far more on health compared to men, with more of women's health services subject to higher out-of-pocket expense—a healthcare cost gap that exacerbates gender-based pay inequalities. Scare-mongering medical marketing may be contributing to this problem by driving more women to unnecessary tests or treatments.Historically, doctors viewed women as the \"sicker sex,\" leading to a surge in medical advice manuals—many focusing on female reproductive health—as early as the 1820s. These manuals, often rife with misinformation, were a prime example of capitalising on women's anxieties. One of the most commercially successful popular medical books of the 19th century gave medical advice to women about how to influence the sex of their child through specific foods and conceptive practices.Another book in the late 20th century sold even more copies with a focus on this same topic. Even as numerous medical experts and research studies had long debunked the notion that the sex of infants could be influenced, products and services purporting to assist women in this flourished.Today this is still the case but in a different form: IVF clinics in some countries provide for women and couples who wish to have a child of a specific sex, by selecting embryos on this basis. It's a costly process: US fertility clinics charge around $4,500 for sex selection—on top of the cost of IVF, which sets patients back around $12,000-$14,000 per cycle.Menopause is another area heavily targeted by marketers. This natural life stage has long been a major focus of gendered commercial targeting—through advice manuals, hormonal balancing programmes and coaching services, and especially through hormonal and pseudo-hormonal products. In 2024, the market for menopause medical products was valued at around $758.5 million, outstripping other medical products marketed at women worldwide by more than double. In Australia, a major 2023 study found there are strong financial incentives to \"catastrophise\" menopause to drive women to purchase treatments. The authors from the Australasian Menopause Society, the Women's Health Research Program at Monash University and Jean Hailes for Women's Health, welcomed the fact \"that perimenopause and menopause are now being discussed publicly\"—but cautioned medical marketers to avoid \"catastrophising\" menopause, \"particularly in the advertising of goods and services, as it could have the unintended consequences of eroding women's resilience and stigmatising women as they approach midlife.\"While there is no doubt that some women suffer disruptive hot flashes and other symptoms in menopause, many do not at all, and known menopause symptoms are claimed to be found only in Western cultures. The globalisation of menopause marketing is therefore creating new markets of \"worried well\" women who otherwise might not consider they needed medicating. Researchers have referred to this as \"disease-mongering\". In the case of menopause products, it may be deeply problematic given the emerging evidence that hormone products taken by midlife women may influence their later risk of diseases of ageing such as dementia and stroke.The rapidly growing femtech industry is another area where some companies are cashing in on women's health—in a way that may not always benefit women as promised. Femtech is a form of women's health technology that has been rapidly growing since 2018. In 2023, the femtech app market was valued at approximately $30 billion and is projected to reach $135 billion by 2032—that is an expected compound annual growth rate of 16 percent.The rise of femtech apps seems like a step forward, offering support for issues like reproductive health or general wellness, which are often overlooked by traditional medicine. Femtech may provide support for some women's health issues that are currently underserved by medical services, such as endometriosis, women's ADHD, and seronegative chronic diseases that often result in women's \"medical gaslighting\".However, the huge profits generated by the femtech industry's expansion raise questions about whether such projects are primarily aimed at improving women's well-being or rather at maximising the potential of women's health concerns as an extractable market. There is growing concern that many women's health apps have inadequate privacy and security practices. Fertility apps, for example, often collect sensitive data about pregnancies and menstrual cycles—and sometimes then share it with others, exposing it to \"re-identification\" and data breach risks. These apps are not always transparent about the data they trade with and collect from other companies.-360info \nAs the midsummer heat threatens to bring a wave of the loo in the plains of Tarai-Madhes, all eyes are on the sky, expecting a spell of cloudbursts and rain. But once the monsoon enters in less than a month, we will be back to running for shelter. This year, Nepal, like much of South Asia, could experience above-normal monsoon rains, the result of La Niña, a condition associated with normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over much of South Asia. Technical experts at the 28 sessions of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum (SASCOF-28) held in the last week of April said the second half of the southwest monsoon season will likely develop La Niña. This will also mark the realisation of the fear of two extremes—of heat and rain—in South Asia this year.While we stand to make some windfall from the wet climate, especially in the agricultural sector, there is a huge cost attached to the onslaught of heavy monsoon rains—landslides and flooding. Each monsoon, we fear the worst disasters but make little preparation to deal with them. And if we do not prepare in advance, the bounty we expect from the monsoon will soon turn into bane. Last monsoon, Nepal witnessed 328 events of landslide, 166 events of heavy rain and 59 events of flooding, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). Ninety-six persons were killed in landslides, 19 in floods and eight in heavy rains. This means that our existing mechanisms of defence against destruction will probably not work. We might face similar or even bigger catastrophes this year, too, if we do not prepare well.But as of now, news reports about advanced preparation for disasters are hardly positive. If the unitary state of the past was inefficient in dealing with disasters, the federal state of Nepal has its own complications. While authorities at the NDRRMA complain of a lack of human and financial resources to deal with large-scale disasters, the local levels, which are the closest and the most accessible forms of the state to the people, have similar woes. The familiar problem of a lack of coordination between the three tiers of government stands to dampen our disaster preparedness and response actions.Another set of disasters that comes as part of the monsoon each year is water-related epidemics. Each monsoon enters with the risk of dengue, malaria, and cholera. And it is in these crucial times that our health care system does not function optimally, with health centres in several parts of the country failing to provide basic medicines and care. We cannot make lethargy a habit and wait for disasters. From daivi prakop (divine disasters) to prakritik prakop (natural disasters), we have made some advances in our understanding of disasters. It is now time to consider disasters manaviya prakop—the result of human actions—and intervene on time for risk reduction and long-term resilience. \nA tourist couple was injured in India’s Kashmir after militants fired on them late on Saturday night, police said, ahead of voting scheduled in the volatile region for India's ongoing election.The couple from the Indian city of Jaipur was evacuated to the hospital and the area where the attack took place was cordoned off, Kashmir police said on social media. The condition of the injured tourists is said to be stable, they said.India is in the middle of a marathon election with the remaining two seats in Kashmir going to polls on May 20 and May 25.Voters turned out in large numbers for polling in the first seat in Srinagar on May 13, reversing the trend of low vote counts in the first polls since Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed the region’s semi-autonomy in 2019.Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is skipping elections in Kashmir for the first time since 1996 saying it will support regional parties instead.Major parties in Kashmir, the National Conference and People’s Democratic Party (PDP), have focused on restoration of semi-autonomy in their campaigns.Analysts and opposition parties say the BJP is not contesting elections in Kashmir because it fears the outcome will contradict its narrative of a more peaceful and integrated region since 2019.In a separate incident, unknown militants shot dead former village headman and BJP party member Ajiaz Ahmad Sheikh in Shopian district on Saturday.The last major attack on tourists in Kashmir had happened in 2017 when a Hindu pilgrimage bus was targeted, killing eight people. \nPartly cloudy with possible light rain and snowfall in hilly areas of Koshi and Gandaki provinces, mainly fair weather elsewhere, and high temperature recorded in Nepalgunj while low temperature in Jomsom.\nAPF Women won their fourth straight Lalitpur Mayor Women's T20 Championship title by defeating Sudurpaschim Province in the final, despite Sudurpaschim's valiant chase led by Kabita Joshi's 67*.\nPrime Minister Dahal seeks to avoid using an ordinance to present the budget, but faces opposition from Nepali Congress, who may obstruct its passage in parliament.\nSeven years after signing the BRI agreement, Nepal and China are still struggling to finalize the implementation plan, with concerns over financing, security, and the need for national consensus.\nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nNepal's 2020 map included disputed territories (Kalapani, Limpiyadhura) under India's control, leading to tensions between the countries, despite a joint committee addressing boundary claims; Oli's mobilization of nationalistic sentiments and return to power played a role.\nClimate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepal’s agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.“The situation is alarming,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.“The survey was intended to see people’s perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,” he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. “Most of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,” said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. “If they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.”The survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nThe widening rift between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the cooperative scam has further complicated the parliamentary process at a time when the government has the compulsion to announce the fiscal budget on May 28. Despite multiple meetings and back-channel negotiations on Friday, the ruling and opposition parties failed to narrow down their differences over the formation of the parliamentary panel. Short of an understanding, meetings of both chambers of Parliament were put off until Sunday. While the National Assembly sitting was adjourned due to an obstruction by the main opposition, the House of Representatives meeting was deferred until Sunday through a notice.A senior Rastriya Swatantra Party leader told the Post that the House session was deferred by a day at the request of Nepali Congress leaders and informal talks between the Congress, the RSP and the prime minister were headed in the positive direction.“We do not want to derail the process of forming the parliamentary probe and we also do not want to introduce the budget through an ordinance,” the RSP leader who is engaged in multiple talks with leaders from ruling and opposition sides said. “We do not want to be seen as a destabilising factor.” A Nepali Congress office bearer told the Post that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s decision to seek a vote of confidence on Monday has made them suspicious. The opposition leaders have smelt a rat after the government’s decision to withdraw the bill related to political parties and frequent changes of the conditions by the ruling parties on the parliamentary probe as well as the resumption of the house session to discuss the government’s policies and programmes and the budget presentation have created suspicion.“Now we are sensing that the government is set to bring the budget through an ordinance if our protest continues,” the Congress official said. The main opposition party is yet to decide whether to obstruct the House on Monday. Prime Minister Dahal has invited senior Nepali Congress leaders for a meeting on Saturday morning. The largest party convened a meeting of opposition parties on Friday. According to Gyanendra Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the parties were one on forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. “But we have also raised the issue that opposition parties should allow Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to speak in the House and let him clarify his position.”Instead of taking the lead to resolve the deadlock in Parliament, the way the prime minister hurriedly seeks a vote of confidence has made the Nepali Congress suspicious. Prime Minister Dahal has decided to go for a floor test on Monday. He is seeking the vote of confidence of the House after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal on May 13 withdrew its support for the government following a split in the party.Some of the prime minister's recent activities did not help resolve the deadline inside the house, Nepali Congress general secretary Gagan Thapa said. The way the prime minister decided to hurriedly seek a vote of confidence and withdraw the bill related to the Political Party Act leads us to suspect that he wants to close the budget session of Parliament and present the budget through an ordinance.The prime minister's meeting with Congress leaders on Friday evening to discuss the latest political situation was deferred till Saturday morning.According to Thapa, the prime minister’s and the CPN-UML’s game plan will result in a loss for the Rastriya Swatantra Party.“Whatever the UML chair says for public consumption, his inner interest is different. The prime minister has his own interests. Finally, the Rastriya Swatantra Party will bear the brunt of these one after another conspiracy. I do not know how seriously the RSP is taking these developments, but if the UML and the Maoist Centre will try to go on a new course, the RSP stands to be impacted a lot,” said Thapa.Thapa said that his party’s position at the moment is to obstruct the House on Monday during the session in which the prime minister goes for a floor test.Suspicions are growing between the ruling and opposition parties over the issue of budget. If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, the ruling parties will go for the budget ordinance. It is up to the Nepali Congress, said Yogesh Bhattarai of the UML.If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, there is no option but to issue the budget through an ordinance.He added that they are hopeful of having positive talks and discussions with the Nepali Congress by Saturday.But the Nepali Congress is adamant on a probe against the home minister for his alleged involvement in Pokhara, Butwal, and Chitwan-based cooperatives. The parliamentary committee is needed to investigate the home minister, Congress spokesman Prakash Sharan Mahat said. Those who are in power and hold positions of authority should not be exempted from investigation.But the RSP has been refusing to form a committee targeting the home minister.“Why is the Nepali Congress only after three cooperatives at a time when 16 cooperatives are in crisis?” said Manish Jha of the RSP.The government has declared 20 cooperative firms as deeply crisis-ridden. The top managers of these cooperatives are either facing police charges or absconding.“Why are you only after three cooperatives?” Jha asked Congress leaders. “Though we cannot probe all 31,000 cooperatives, we can probe those in crisis.” Jha said that Congress leaders have no uniform opinions on how to resolve the cooperative crisis.“It’s been difficult for us to understand whose voice is authoritative in the Nepali Congress. The Congress office bearers have differing positions on forming the parliamentary committee and its terms of reference,” said Jha. “Who do we trust? We have urged the Nepali Congress leaders to come up with an official position on the party’s letterhead.” \nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has questioned the constitutional role and the impartiality of Speaker Devraj Ghimire following a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives.After Thursday’s incident, relations between the ruling CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the main opposition, Nepali Congress, could get more sour.“The Speaker should take the main responsibility for today’s incident,” Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said during a news conference after the scuffle between the opposition and ruling lawmakers. “The Speaker was following a leader’s order.” Thapa hinted that the Speaker was guided by the ruling CPN-UML. Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions. While speaking at a function on Wednesday, Oli had stated that Thursday’s Parliament meeting would proceed despite obstruction by the Nepali Congress. “Today we saw that happen,” said Thapa. “This means the Speaker was taking orders from the leader [Oli].”Thapa claimed that when his party’s vice-president, Dhanraj Gurung, was chanting slogans demanding a parliamentary probe, Oli approached and provoked him. Then the scuffle ensued, said Thapa.Thapa also declared that the Congress will not sit for talks with anyone until a parliamentary committee is formed. Some Congress leaders were earlier in talks with their Rastriya Swatantra Party counterparts and had exchanged terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary committee, but there was no further development due to their differences. Leaders said that Thursday’s scuffle has added to the uncertainty of the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam and Lamichhane’s alleged involvement.“We were about to agree on the terms of reference [ToR] of the proposed parliamentary committee with the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” said a Nepali Congress office bearer. “But there was a disagreement after the RSP refused to include the home minister’s name in the draft.”The ToR proposed by the Congress explicitly called for probing the role of the home minister in the cooperatives scam. But the RSP has been insisting on a probe into the entire cooperatives sector and not Lamichhane.   \nThe parliamentary meeting on Thursday that was expected to end the ongoing impasse ended up in a scuffle between the ruling and opposition lawmakers.The House meeting called for 11 in the morning was postponed until 4 pm in an attempt to find a meeting point among the parties over the formation of a parliamentary panel to probe Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s embezzlement of cooperatives funds. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal himself had held meetings with ruling parties and also the main opposition Nepali Congress to find a way out. However, the ruling parties and the Congress couldn’t agree on terms of reference of the parliamentary probe committee.The ruling parties agreed to constitute the parliamentary panel to investigate the embezzlement of savings in the cooperatives and recommend action against the individuals, institutions and companies benefited illegally. However, the Congress wanted the probe focused on Rabi Lamichhane, erstwhile managing director at the Gorkha Media Network, and others who illegally benefited from Supreme, Suryadarshan, and Swarnalaxmi, among other cooperatives. The ruling parties, particularly Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), did not agree to the proposal to focus only on the cooperatives where Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane is allegedly involved. “Our demand is to constitute a parliamentary committee to investigate the problems facing the cooperative sector, including Rabi Lamichhane’s involvement in the alleged fraud. The ruling alliance is not ready for it. It wants a panel that will broadly investigate the problems in the sector without addressing our concerns. The alliance is trying to divert attention from the main issue,” said Prakash Sharan Mahat, the Nepali Congress spokesperson explaining why there could be no agreement.The ruling parties, however, say the Congress, guided by a mala fide intent, has been insisting on an investigation committee focusing on three or four cooperatives. “We had just demands: first, our chairperson must be allowed to clarify on the allegations in Parliament. Second, as problems have been seen in several cooperatives, there must be a broader investigation,” said Manish Jha, an RSP lawmaker. “Why just focus on three or four cooperatives? Why not probe the cooperatives that are led by Congress leaders?”The meeting of the House of Representatives postponed for 4 pm was held two hours later. No sooner had the meeting commenced, the Congress started chanting slogans. Amid the obstruction, Speaker Devraj Ghimire read out the letters from the President’s Office regarding the authentication of a bill and addition of ministers from the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party. The situation got tense when Ghimire asked Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and address the meeting amid the protest of the main opposition.The Congress lawmakers had already gathered at the well and were raising slogans demanding a parliamentary probe into Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling funds of several credit cooperatives.After the Speaker allowed the minister to go to the rostrum, the Congress lawmakers and senior CPN-UML leaders, who were on the front row of the ruling bench, engaged in heated verbal exchanges. The situation escalated after UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress vice president Dhanraj Gurung engaged in an intense argument. Other lawmakers from the two sides subsequently joined the resulting scuffle. Even Prime Minister Dahal and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Rekha Sharma engaged in an argument with the Congress lawmakers.Both sides have pointed fingers at each other for the tensions. “The situation escalated after the Congress lawmakers tried to stand in front of the rows designated for the ruling parties in order to prevent Home Minister Lamichhane from heading to the rostrum,” said Sharma. “The Congress is responsible for the unparliamentary behaviour.” The UML has demanded an apology from the Congress, claiming its lawmakers misbehaved with Oli.The Congress, however, said the Speaker’s irresponsible move [of inviting the home minister to the rostrum] was responsible for the unpleasant incident in the House. “The Speaker is guided by partisan interests. It was wrong of him to invite the home minister to address the House when the opposition was obstructing the House,” said Mahat. The next House meeting has been called for 11 am Friday.Earlier, the meeting of the National Assembly was also adjourned until 1:15 pm on Friday following obstruction from the Nepali Congress.The main opposition has been obstructing the budget session of Parliament since the first day of the session that commenced on May 10. However, the opposition parties had allowed the President to table the government’s policies and programmes. The RSP has said they will not agree to any probe panel targeting its chairperson. “The probe panel will be formed only if there is an agreement to investigate the Congress President [Sher Bahadur Deuba] and his son,” said Jha. “To challenge our party, those who have been in power for decades need to come clean.” \nNepal’s two biggest parties are making scathing criticism of each other.Senior coalition partner CPN-UML and the main opposition Nepali Congress, which is the largest party in the House of Representatives, have trained their guns on each other over the recent Supreme Court verdict on a multi-billion-rupee land swap scam.After the Supreme Court on May 12 issued the full text of its verdict related to the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate, at the prime location of Birtamod in Jhapa, the Congress demanded an investigation into those involved in making the decision on the land swap.Terming the court verdict as historic, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa posted a statement on social media on Tuesday, saying: “It has now been proven that the then government’s decision was wrong … Therefore, there should be further investigation against those involved.”The Supreme Court on February 7 overturned the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government's decision. On April 26, 2021, the Oli-led government allowed the use of the land exempting the ceiling for the deal. However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oli’s Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific land’s detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the court’s final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new location’s production capacity. Technical experts’ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.“It [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,” Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. “The Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,” Oli said. “They once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.”When the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. “Abiding by the court’s ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,” Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives funds’ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhane’s most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. “The parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,” Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oli’s allegations against his party. When the Oli government amended laws related to land-swapping, Thapa of the Congress, who demanded an investigation into the Oli Cabinet’s decision, was a House member. Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.“Though one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,” Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli government’s decision in the court, told the Post. “In such instances, it’s the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.”King Mahendra’s implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step. The law fixed the ceiling of land possession by individuals at 28 bighas in Tarai districts. The land exceeding the ceiling would be nationalised. Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the law’s implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information. In Birtamod, Jhapa, the Giri brothers owned 500 bighas. Before the Land Reforms Act came into effect, the Giri brothers proceeded to register the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in order to safeguard the property. Land reform laws introduced later did not apply to the land as it had already been used for agricultural purposes. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel delivered the government's policies and programmes on Tuesday after the Nepali Congress lifted the obstruction in the House of Representatives. However, the disruption continued afterwards.President Paudel read out the policies and programmes of the government in the joint sitting of the federal parliament.The Congress then blocked the proceedings of both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly and did not let the assembly table a motion of expressing gratitude to the President for delivering the government’s annual paper.It is customary for Parliament to thank the President for reading out the annual policies and programmes. The parliamentary party meeting of the Congress on Tuesday morning, however, had decided not to allow Parliament to proceed after the head of state wraps up his presentation.The Congress later responded that the policies and programmes fail to address the problems of cooperatives’ victims. The main opposition has been protesting in Parliament, demanding a parliamentary probe into the issue of cooperatives around the country embezzling the deposits of hundreds of thousands of depositors. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane is the focus of the largest party’s fury for his alleged involvement in the cooperative scam. “Our position that the government has protected the people who have swindled cooperatives victims has been reconfirmed,” said Ramesh Lekhak, the chief whip of the Congress party, while talking to the media after the policies and programmes had been read out.The main opposition party was initially not ready to allow the smooth operation of the Parliament’s proceedings. The party even warned the government and the ruling partners that it would prevent President Paudel from presenting the government's policies and programmes should its demand go unheeded.The Congress has been disrupting Parliament, demanding a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane over allegations of cooperative funds embezzlement. Lamichhane has publicly refuted the charges and asked for a chance to make his case clear in Parliament.But the Congress has been preventing Lamichhane from speaking in the House. The Congress, which appeared tough against the resumption of parliamentary business, even the presidential appearance, had relented and agreed to let the President present the programmes. But it resorted to the obstruction soon after. In 2017, the CPN-UML, while in the opposition, had been obstructing parliamentary proceedings. It allowed then-President Bidya Devi Bhandari to present the annual policies. The opposition then protested the Cabinet’s decision to increase the number of local federal units in the Tarai in the midst of the elections. The party later obstructed the motion of thanks to the President.During Speaker Devraj Ghimire’s meeting with the party chief whips on Tuesday afternoon, before the President read out the government’s annual document, the Congress had announced its plan to continue to disrupt the House after the policies had been presented.“We will continue to interrupt the House until our demand is addressed,” Congress whip Sushila Thing told the Post. “As there is no parliamentary practice of barring the head of state to present policies and programmes, we too didn’t go that uncharted route.”The party will not allow other proceedings of the two houses for as long as it takes in order to get its demands addressed, Thing said.On Tuesday morning, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa and the party’s Chief Whip Lekhak met Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to discuss the issue of parliamentary obstruction. Dahal had requested the Congress leaders to allow a smooth functioning of the legislature. The Congress leaders also claimed that the prime minister seemed positive about addressing their demand.“While meeting our leaders, the prime minister seemed positive but he has not taken the necessary steps to honour the call of the main opposition,” Congress whip Thing said. Dahal’s openness to the formation of the probe committee was one of the reasons the Congress became ready to allow the President to present the policies and programmes. Shakti Basnet, the minister of energy, water resources and irrigation, claimed that the discussion between the government and Congress was headed in a positive direction.“Until late Monday night, the Congress was adamant on barring the President from presenting the policies and programmes. But on Tuesday, we reached an agreement to allow the President to do so,” Basnet, a Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, told the Post. “The government will similarly reach an agreement with the Congress on its demand for the probe committee.”According to the Congress leaders, Sunday's meeting between the prime minister and Congress leaders also concluded positively to address the party's demand. After the Congress leaders met Prime Minister Dahal, the party held the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday morning. The same meeting allowed President Paudel to confer the government's annual policies and programmes. The ruling parties and the main opposition have been discussing smooth operation of Parliament for the past few days. However, given the inflexible positions of both sides, Tuesday’s session was expected to face trouble.“The ruling parties and the opposition need to come to a logical conclusion to open the parliamentary business,” UML whip Sunita Baral told the Post. “It looks like both sides only have discussed the issue at their ease. What we need is negotiation to resolve the issues of both Parliament and the cooperative scam.”The constitution mandates the government to present its annual budget on Jestha 15 (May 28 this year). For this reason also, the ruling and opposition parties need to close their ranks, Baral added.The ruling parties are ready to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the issues plaguing the cooperative sector. However, they are reluctant to constitute a committee with the mandate to probe Lamichhane. The Congress, too, is positive about a broad inquiry into the cooperatives, but it deems investigating Lamichhane in particular a necessity after various probes by police and other government bodies established his involvement in the scams. The Congress had disrupted the winter session of Parliament before it was prorogued on April 14, with the same demand. The party has also been obstructing the new session of Parliament that commenced on May 10. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n\nA man, who was injured while putting out a fire at Tapeshwar community forest in Godawari Municipality-4, Badikhel, succumbed to burn injuries on Tuesday.According to Senior Superintended of Police Shekhar Khanal of Lalitpur District Police Range, Shankar Pahari died while undergoing treatment at the Kirtipur-based Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre.Another injured, Ramesh Pahari, is being treated at the hospital.Meanwhile, a fire at Ananda forest in Godawari Municipality-6, Lele is yet to be brought under control. A total of 65 patients have been moved to a safer place after the fire spread to the premises of the Anandaban Hospital. \nNepal’s food safety agency has banned the sales and imports of popular Indian spice brands MDH and Everest with an immediate effect, based on the findings from several countries that they contain ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing chemical. The quality watchdog has also decided to recall and seize products currently in the customs clearance process.The move follows bans by several countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Maldives, and scrutiny by the Australian authorities.“We decided to ban the spices of the two Indian companies with immediate effect based on scientific evidence from several other countries showing high levels of carcinogenic pesticide ethylene oxide in many spice mixes. This poses a cancer risk,” said Matina Joshi Vaidhya, director general of the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control.“We will allow their sale, imports and distribution once we get clearance from the manufacturing country that they are safe to consume.” Experts say the presence of ethylene oxide, which is a flammable colourless gas with a sweet odour, in the spices, is concerning, as varieties of the products of both companies are easily available in Nepal and are popular too.Ethylene oxide is primarily used to produce other chemicals, including antifreeze. In smaller amounts, it is also used as a pesticide and sterilising agent.Lymphoma and leukaemia are the cancers most frequently associated with occupational exposure to ethylene oxide. Stomach and breast cancers may also be linked to ethylene oxide exposure.Vaidhya said countries have their own acceptable limits for pesticide use. If products are found to exceed the limits set by the department, the department will direct relevant authorities to recall them from the market.The department accordingly issued a circular to agencies on Friday to recall the spices from the market. The quality watchdog has also directed the National Food and Feed Reference Laboratory to prioritise testing for ethylene oxide.Ganesh Agrawal, an official of Jay Ganapati Enterprises in Biratnagar, the distributor of Fish Curry Masala manufactured by Everest Food Products Pvt Limited, told the Post that they knew about the issue through news reports and had planned to stop selling the product. “The sales, however, are not significant.”Earlier this month, Hong Kong and Singapore banned the sale of MDH and Everest spice brands, citing the detection of carcinogenic pesticide ethylene oxide in several spice mixes.India is the world's largest spice producer, consumer and exporter. Zion Market Research estimates India's domestic spice market to be worth $10.44 billion in 2022, and the Spices Board said India exported products worth $4 billion during 2022-23.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 946.42 tonnes of various Everest brand spices from India and other countries, amounting to Rs120 million, in the last fiscal year ending mid-July 2023. Spice imports from India alone amounted to 478 tonnes worth Rs74.65 million. Similarly, the imports of the MDH brand spice amounted to 1,143.76 tonnes worth Rs637.21 million. From India alone, Nepal imported 1,141.96 tonnes of spice worth Rs635 million.Consumer rights activists say that authorities must take urgent action as the issue is related to public health.“As the products that were found to be hazardous to public health in Hong Kong and Singapore are widely available in Nepal too, it would be irresponsible to wait for a test report to prohibit their use,” Jyoti Baniya, chairman of the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights, told the Post in a recent interview.“It will be too late to wait for the report—we should not forget that this is directly linked to public health.”The quality watchdog said they have started inspecting the department stores and groceries to remove the banned spice. \nFor decades, cross-border trade between Nepal and India was traditionally done due to social ties spanning borders. The situation now is different. It’s now an organised commercial informal trade happening at a large scale, according to a research finding. Rice appears to be a key commodity ‘highly informally’ imported from India to Nepal. The research, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, shows that only 40 percent of rice is imported to Nepal from India through a formal channel.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, leading to a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports. In the current fiscal year, the government also introduced a 13 percent VAT on some vegetables, including onions and potatoes.With this variation, the price differences between Nepal and India become 18-20 percent, or rice in India becomes cheaper by at least 18 percent.The paper said that India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west. According to a separate report by the International Food Policy Research Institute, carrying or informally transferring goods has become a full-time profession for many poor families living close to the towns along the Nepal-India border.“Carriers,” many of them women, collect the goods on the Indian side and bring them in via the open border, escaping the formal customs entry points, sometimes on foot, sometimes on bicycles and motorbikes, and always at their own risk.Presenting the report titled ‘Insights into Informal Cross-Border Trade in Agri-Food Commodities in South Asia’, Dikshya Singh, programme coordinator at SAWTEE, a South Asian think tank based in Kathmandu, said the export duty imposed by India on rice in September 2022 followed by an export ban on non-basmati rice in July 2023, fueled the informal trade.The report said that rice, vegetables, chemical fertilisers, and seeds are other agricultural products and inputs that have been largely coming through informal channels.The study reveals that this informal trade is dominated by a small group of traders forming an oligopoly. Moreover, the study indicates that large-scale informal trade is controlled by mafia-style syndicates with political backing.Anand Bagaria, managing director of Nimbus Holdings, said Nepal needs proactive measures to deal with informal cross-border trade. “Since we cannot influence our neighbouring countries’ policies, Nepal needs to be clear about what could be the right balance between inflation, government revenue, and mitigating quality-related risks while dealing with informal trade.”Singh said Nepal heavily relies on informal trade to meet its need for agricultural inputs.The report attributes the illegal import of chemical fertiliser to the persistent shortage in Nepal and cheaper rates in India.The report showed that Nepal needs 800,000 tonnes of chemical fertiliser annually. The country has been able to import 400,000 tonnes formally, and an estimated 200,000 tonnes come through informal channels. According to the report, farmers in Nepal have been informally importing a variety of seeds that are not available locally, especially hybrid seeds of vegetables, mainly due to import restrictions and to avoid non-tariff requirements.SAWTEE conducted surveys at nine customs points, including Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Biratnagar, Nepalgunj, Kakarbhitta, Krishnanagar, Jaleshwar, Suthauli, Maheshpur, and Bhadrapur and the border crossings in their periphery.“The informal trade between Nepal and India is as big as formal trade,” said Paras Kharel, executive director of SAWTEE. Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary, said that gold and silver, areca (palm) nuts, onion and garlic, poppy seed, edible oil, and black pepper are informally exported to India from Nepal. “Informal trade is rising between Nepal and India because of the price differences caused mainly due tariff advantage and tariff differences and non-tariff barriers for formal export.”“The misdeclaration of exported goods from Nepal to India needs to be addressed,” he said. For instance, Nepal exports cabbage to India from Koshi province. As India has restricted the import of other types of vegetables from Nepal, traders are exporting other vegetables like okra, chayote, and chilli under the name of cabbage, Ojha said.Article 2 of the trade treaty between Nepal and India, and the agreement on cooperation to control unauthorised trade talks about controlling informal trade. “During the bilateral discussion, be it commerce level, inter-government committee meetings, or customs director-level meetings, either annually or bi-annually, they discuss informal trade. But there hasn’t been any serious discussion about controlling informal trade,” Ojha said.Nepal raised issues like the informal import of agricultural goods from India to Nepal, while the Indian side brought up issues like the informal import of goods including areca nuts, edible oil, poppy seeds, and black pepper, but no concrete solution has been found yet, according to Ojha. Sabnam Shivakoti, joint secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, pointed out that cross-border trade that was done traditionally due to social ties across borders is not the same as the organised commercial informal trade that is happening now on a large scale. “This has been affecting agricultural and industrial sectors as they have to compete with cheap imports.”According to Shivakoti, an import restriction on dairy products was announced in February 2024 to protect domestic farmers and the dairy industry, but that led to formal imports being diverted to informal channels.Trade experts said that as the Indian government is providing eight types of subsidies on agricultural products, as a result, Nepali products become less competitive even in the domestic market, raising the informal trade to Nepal. \nNepal and Lithuania established diplomatic relations in 2005, focusing on limited trade (including medical cotton and spices), exploring high-tech cooperation (particularly in cybersecurity and laser technology), promoting tourism, and collaborating on issues of global concern like climate change.\nEU launches a guide to facilitate Nepal's Pashmina export, supporting the processing facility and aiming to elevate exports to $75 million by 2026.\nAir pollution is a leading cause of respiratory illnesses, high blood pressure, and other health issues in Nepal, with over 600 people seeking care at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital on designated days, shortening Nepalese lives by an average of five years and negatively impacting public health, economy, and development.\nDespite a lack of addiction, 19-year-old Amit vapes; Nepal's government bans e-cigarettes despite concerns that some may switch back to smoking, with 33 countries banning e-cigarettes and Nepal having no regulations.\nPre-monsoon rains and prevalent conditions increase concerns about an imminent dengue outbreak in Nepal, fueled by 57 districts reporting cases and an average weekly infection count of 50.\nThe Ministry of Health and Population plans to screen pregnant women for mental health problems, which have been emerging as a leading cause of maternal deaths.Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and prompt treatment will help cut down on maternal deaths that have been rising alarmingly of late.“We plan to start screening from Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital,” said Dr Gauri Shrestha, chief of the Safe Motherhood Programme at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “As part of the pilot, all pregnant women seeking service will be screened from the first and postnatal trimesters.”A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with the majority occurring during pregnancy.The report shows that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications.Nepal had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The report showed 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. The study was carried out in 2021.Every year, hundreds of women in the country succumb to preventable deaths from excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), which have been identified as chief causes of maternal deaths in Nepal.However, the 2021 study also shows that a significant number of maternal deaths are also caused by non-obstetric complications such as intentional self-harm.Of the 611 maternal deaths on which the study was based, 67 percent occurred during and after childbirth, according to the report.The census report shows 33 percent of the total maternal deaths occurred during pregnancy, six percent died during childbirth and 61 percent during the postpartum stage.Of the total maternal deaths, nearly a half (47 percent) occurred in Lumbini and Madhesh provinces. The report shows that 10 percent of the victims were 15 to 19 years old. Fifty-seven percent of the deaths happened in health facilities and 26 percent at homes. Of the total maternal deaths, 412 women (53 per cent) went to four antenatal care visits, and of the 173 women who died between seven to 42 days, 45 percent had received postnatal care.As part of its efforts to reduce maternal deaths, the Health Ministry has made it mandatory for women to make eight antenatal care visits and three postnatal care visits.Of the total maternal deaths, six percent (37 women) had undergone abortion or suffered a miscarriage. The report shows that 62 percent of the women took maternity services at state-run health facilities whereas 38 percent gave birth at private health centres.The report shows family members of 83 percent of women who died during or after childbirth tried to get hospital care. Forty-eight percent of those who did use hospital services did not deem it necessary to seek institutional care, according to the report.Delay in finding appropriate health facilities (57 percent), delay in reaching appropriate health facilities (33 percent) and delay in getting appropriate health services (40 percent) are three major causes of maternal deaths, the study shows. Of the total maternal deaths, 17 percent were attributed to all three aforementioned causes and 74 percent to at least one of three causes.The report suggested improving the quality of services and the referral system and making ambulances available for emergency calls as possible ways for identifying the risks on time. The report also suggested carrying out maternal death surveillance regularly to reduce preventable deaths.The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes including free institutional delivery service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. The ministry has also distributed misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. “As the annual health budget does not help us carry out screening of mental health programmes in many places, we are starting the programme as a pilot from the Maternity Hospital,” said Shrestha. “This programme will be expanded in the coming years to other districts, as it is impossible to prevent suicide of pregnant women without treatment of mental health problems.”Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nAt least 50 health workers including medical officers, health assistants and paramedics serving in health facilities of Kathmandu district have been trained to screen patients suffering from non-communicable diseases.The Kathmandu Health Office provided the health workers with a four-day training. The trained health workers will screen major non-communicable diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health problems, among others, in patients seeking healthcare at local health facilities of the district, according to officials at the Health Office Kathmandu.“Patients seeking healthcare services at the local units of Kathmandu will be screened for non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “Health workers will prescribe medicines for non-communicable diseases, counsel patients and refer them to a tertiary care centre if the problems are complicated.”Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.The study showed that the leading risk factor of death in 2019 was smoking, whose attributable death was 17.7 percent, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution 9.3 percent, diabetes 8 percent, high cholesterol, and kidney dysfunction, among others.The Ministry of Health and Population has included medicines for non-communicable diseases in the list of 98 free essential medicines, which it provides free of cost from state-run health facilities.The free medicines on the list include medicines for some non-communicable diseases—mental health, cardiovascular, respiratory illness and diabetes, among others.Officials say that even if the burden of non-communicable diseases surpassed communicable diseases years ago and medicines for some ailments are provided free of cost, many people do not know their disease conditions due to lack of screening at health facilities.The Health Ministry in the past had decided to provide free screening for certain non-communicable diseases to people above 40 years old. However, such services have not started in many health facilities.“Trained health workers will screen the patients visiting health facilities they serve at,” said Sapkota. “We hope that patients suffering from non-communicable diseases will be diagnosed on time, which will ultimately help in lessening the burden of non-communicable diseases.”Doctors say most people do not undergo testing unless it is an emergency and also do not know if they are suffering from a serious ailment. They say that a lot of lives will be saved if testing of non-communicable diseases is made free.Public health experts say the increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases is a global phenomenon but developing countries like Nepal have been facing a double burden. \nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York, promotes Nepali cuisine through his restaurant \"The Sewing Tin,\" blending traditional flavors with modern techniques, while sharing its stories and facing challenges as an outsider in the city.\nCeleus Baral, an environment science student with a passion for baking, runs an online shop and recently started selling at The Yellow House's Night Market, emphasizing sustainable practices and infusing her creations with her artistic sensibility and love for nature.\nPotato, a versatile and nutrient-rich staple food in Nepal, flourishes despite climatic changes and is consumed in various forms, including chips and fries, but excessive consumption of fried potatoes can have adverse health effects.\nChicken eggs, a rich source of essential nutrients, are widely consumed in Nepal due to their affordability and health benefits, including weight loss, reduced blood pressure, protection against infections, and prenatal bone strengthening.\nPiano Piano South, an Italian restaurant in Lalitpur, offers a tranquil ambiance with indoor and outdoor seating, a revised menu featuring Antipasti, Platti Principali, and desserts, accompanied by a curated wine selection.\nNepal offers significant attractions including the Mundhum Trek, Janaki Mandir, Kuri Village, Annapurna Base Camp, Bardiya National Park, Khaptad National Park, and the picturesque Limi Valley, providing a diverse range of cultural and natural experiences for visitors.\nReturning to his hometown Phidim after a long absence, the author witnesses its transformation from a quaint town to a bustling transit hub, marked by a loss of opportunities that has led to an exodus of its people.\nBara Imambara, built in 1784 in Lucknow, is a historic complex featuring the Rumi Darwaza, Asafi Mosque, Asafi Hall with Asaf-ud-Daula's tomb, Bhool Bhulaiyaa labyrinth, and Shahi Baoli stepwell, showcasing architectural brilliance and Mughal-era artistry.\nNepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers in 2022, emphasizing the value of experienced trekking guides for navigating the treacherous terrains of Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu, with tips provided by Luckme Syangden and Manu Rai for the preparation, gear, and challenges encountered by female trekkers.\nFive women started Duluwa Outdoors in 2021 to inspire and enable women to travel alone in Nepal, addressing a gap in the industry and providing a space for connection and empowerment.\nTribhuvan Army Club’s Deepak Adhikari and Nepal Police Club’s Rajpura Pachhai won the men’s and women’s half-marathon titles of the 2024 Kantipur Half Marathon on Saturday.Adhikari, who was a runner-up in the 2022 edition, timed one hour seven minutes and 15 seconds to win the men’s 21.1 km race to claim his maiden Kantipur Half Marathon title.Rajpura Pachhai defended the title of the women’s 21.1 km half marathon.

Four people have been arrested, he said.The Spanish foreign ministry said that the consular emergency unit had been fully mobilised and the victims and their families were being assisted.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on social messaging platform X that he was “shocked by the news of the murder of Spanish tourists in Afghanistan”. There was no immediate indication of why the attack happened.Mountainous Bamyan is home to a UNESCO world heritage site and the remains of two giant Buddha statues which were blown up by the Taliban during their previous rule in 2001.Since taking over Afghanistan in 2021 the Taliban have vowed to restore security and encourage a small but growing number of tourists trickling into the country and sell tickets to access the Buddha statues.Friday’s attack was among the most serious targeting foreign citizens since foreign forces left and the Taliban took over in 2021.The Islamic State claimed an attack that injured Chinese citizens at a hotel popular with Chinese businessmen in Kabul in 2022. \nLai Ching-te, Taiwan’s incoming president, vows stability by maintaining the status quo with China amidst heightened military incursions and influence campaigns.\nRiots in New Caledonia have killed four, stranded Australians ration food, and prompted French police reinforcements to arrive and establish food and medicine supply teams.\nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe aspirations of multiple generations are tied to a nation’s development through experience, expertise, skill, new ideas and innovation. This lays the groundwork for a thriving society where each individual plays a vital role. For such a vision to come to fruition, it is essential to effectively utilise human resources. However, the question persists: How can a nation tap into the potential of its young workforce, ambitious achievers, learners, experienced retirees, migrant returnees and vulnerable populations primed for empowerment through education?Consider the management of police and military personnel on the verge of retirement, mainly those retiring in five years. In the past fiscal year, 5,961 police personnel chose voluntary retirement. One wonders what happens to their preparedness for combat and mindset regarding deployment after retirement and when retirement time approaches. The security mindset ingrained in police forces and militaries demands perpetual vigilance, rigorous training and an unwavering commitment to upholding public safety through proactive assessment and decisive action when required. There is a need to balance the seasoned and disciplined attributes they hone over the years.Comprehending the present challenges faced by students in Nepal is another aspect worth considering, as it can offer valuable perspectives on the employment scenario. Recent findings from the first-ever textbook audit report conducted by Education in Every Home, an organisation working on the education sector in Nepal, paint a stark picture: Only 75 percent children complete 8th grade, with a mere 27 percent advancing to 12th grade. How can the diverse youth receive the support they need from the government and society to enhance their thought processes and effectively utilise their potential when they don’t complete their education? Enhancing human resource management for those on the brink of retirement and promoting youth employment demands more than abstract notions. Practical steps are required to unite people of all ages. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and mentorship programmes is paramount. Moreover, it’s imperative to foster connections among eager learners, individuals seeking guidance and those who derive fulfilment from careers like police and military service. By valuing these professions and harnessing the spirit of youth, we can create a more dynamic and impactful community. Yet, beyond these efforts, we must explore innovative strategies to effectively manage human resources and combat unemployment. Tackling unemploymentThe unemployment problem can be tackled in two ways. First, the government can emulate the historical approach of Franklin D Roosevelt, who galvanised the “lost generation” to pioneer civilian conservation corps initiatives in forestry, flood control and infrastructure enhancements in the United States. As Homraj Acharya, a seasoned policy expert with extensive experience in US government and development projects in South Asia, contends, the Roosevelt approach left an indelible mark on the physical, psychological and employability facets of three million individuals enrolled in the programme. Their involvement in economic relief and conservation efforts offers a blueprint for modern initiatives tackling poverty and environmental concerns. Enrollees resided in camps, engaged in various projects and underwent rigorous training and education within the corps. This precedent offers a compelling model for addressing unemployment, poverty and environmental conservation.Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt’s visionary approach, Nepal could mobilise individuals nearing retirement age to establish a development brigade. This could enlist 50,000 individuals with approximately five years left until retirement, comprising 5,000 from the police force, 5,000 from the military and 40,000 from civilian sectors. The government can allocate additional funds to boost the salaries of police and military officers nearing retirement for joining the development brigade. These individuals can undertake infrastructure development, community enhancement, park innovation, river and lake clean up and conservation, road construction, solar panel installations, reforestation, herbs production and processing and unused productive land utilisation. This strategic initiative addresses unemployment and capitalises on valuable skills and expertise for national advancement. By offering meaningful employment opportunities in these sectors, Nepal can harness their skills and experience, reducing unemployment rates. This targeted approach would ensure continued workforce contribution and alleviate the financial burden on social welfare programmes, ultimately promoting more excellent economic stability and societal resilience.Second, to actively engage youth and students in meaningful work, introducing service learning—an educational approach—can inspire them to participate in community-based projects, nurturing awareness, empathy, critical thinking skills, leadership abilities, teamwork, cultural competence, communication skill and a sense of social responsibility. The mandatory service-learning project for high school students can be easily connected to the development brigade initiative, suggests Acharya. The programme, also known as community learning or experiential learning, can foster collaboration between universities, businesses, nonprofits and government entities, benefiting the local community. Through service-learning courses, students earn credits while undertaking hands-on experiences such as office work, fieldwork, journaling and reflection papers. They can expand professional networks, cultivate friendships, enhance well-being, build confidence, confirm career interests, and explore new fields of study. Introducing the concept of service learning, which can later evolve into the digital literacy brigade, can facilitate a smooth transition from acquiring practical skills to addressing unemployment for the youth and students of Nepal. As students engage in hands-on experiences during service-learning courses, they cultivate crucial skills for navigating the generational realm, enhancing employability and contributing to workforce readiness. This will ultimately benefit the country through a more skilled and capable workforce fostering economic improvement. Such initiatives provide practical solutions and promote a unified responsibility for societal progress. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and meaningful employment opportunities shall ensure that everyone, regardless of age or background, can meaningfully contribute to the nation’s advancement. By grasping the importance of intelligent human resource management and investing in the growth of citizens, Nepal can build a rock-solid base for a vibrant and challenging society. Here, every single member steps up to mould the shared future.Nepal is a development professional and co-founder of Education in Every Home. \nMore than two years after Russia invaded Ukraine, the West, remarkably, still lacks a unified strategy. Though it has supplied desperately needed weapons and ammunition, it has done little else to address Ukraine’s needs.What would an effective strategy look like? For starters, Western governments need to establish shared goals. Ukraine must expel Russian forces and recover all the territory that it has lost since 2014; Russia must be forced to pay war reparations to compensate Ukraine (the World Bank estimates that reconstruction will cost about $500 billion over the next decade); the thousands of Ukrainians who have been deported to Russia must be allowed to return; and the tens of thousands of suspected war crimes committed by Russian troops must be prosecuted and punished.The West can no longer get away with promising to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.” Rather than holding Ukraine back from attacking Russian strategic and military assets, it should welcome such strikes. Losing the war is the best thing that could happen to Russia. Historically, military defeats have usually led to reforms and a change in leadership – as happened after the Crimean War (1853-56), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), and the war in Afghanistan (1979-88). Vladimir Putin has re-introduced Stalinist-level repression and opted for eternal war, a project that is likely to end in his demise. While it is ultimately up to Russians to effect regime change, the West should welcome the prospect.Many believe that Russia has the advantage in a long war, simply because its population and economy are larger than Ukraine’s (though the United States was defeated in Vietnam and Afghanistan after long wars). Whatever the case, a longer war undoubtedly will cost everyone much more. As such, the West should return to former US Secretary of State Colin Powell’s Gulf War tactic of “shock and awe” to bring about a Ukrainian victory.That means delivering all the best conventional arms to Ukraine as soon as possible, rather than continuing the current drip-feed of old weapons. Nobody can put such weapons to better use than Ukraine’s skilful soldiers. If Ukraine were to lose, Russian forces would march further into Europe to fulfil Putin’s neo-Czarist ambition of restoring the Russian Empire. Since Ukraine’s people are fighting and dying to defend Europe, the least the West can do is give them all they need to win. Denmark and the Baltic states have set an example others should follow.Specifically, the West should furnish Ukraine with potent long-range weapons—such as ATACMS and Taurus missiles—as well as a strong air force, so that it can gain supremacy over the skies. With thousands of Westerners having volunteered to fight for Ukraine on the front lines, why shouldn’t Western pilots join, too? Ukraine needs proper air defense. Absurdly, the West has made Russia, rather than Ukraine, a no-fly zone.The eminent retired US Generals Ben Hodges and Philip Breedlove have long argued that Crimea is likely to be decisive. Similarly, in the mid-nineteenth century, Pavel Nakhimov, an admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy, observed that whoever controls Sevastopol (Crimea’s largest port) controls the Black Sea. Clearly, Ukrainian control of that city should be a major strategic goal. To cut Russia off from Crimea, Ukraine also will need to destroy the Kerch Strait bridges to the peninsula.To force Russia to pay war reparations to Ukraine, the West should confiscate the $300 billion of Russian central-bank reserves that it has frozen. Canada and the US have already adopted laws authorising such a move; they should follow through, and the European Union should follow suit. It is unconscionable that Russia can violate international laws with abandon and still have its property shielded in the West. As long as the war continues, the West will need to provide Ukraine with $100 billion per year—$50 billion at least in military assistance, $40 billion to finance the civilian government, and $10 billion in humanitarian assistance.While Western sanctions on Russia have had some bite, they must be strengthened. Owing to the existing sanctions, the Russian economy has not grown since 2014, and its export revenues fell by 26 percent last year. But to tighten sanctions further, all Western governments should impose prohibitive tariffs on all imports from Russia—as the EU is currently doing with respect to Russian agricultural goods. Western countries have already rescinded Russia’s most-favoured-nation status, and bounded tariffs permitted by the World Trade Organization are very high. Since Western countries trade so little with Russia, higher tariffs will no longer have any meaningful impact on their domestic inflation. And since the customs system functions well, enforcement problems would be minimised.During the Cold War, Western governments cooperated through the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom), headquartered in Paris. That body should be restored to ensure more effective control over sensitive exports to Russia. Personal sanctions also need to be coordinated, reinforced, and streamlined. All sanctioning jurisdictions should agree on similar rules, impose the same sanctions, and exchange classified information about the reasons for them.Meanwhile, Russians who condemn the war and withdraw from Russia should be delisted in all jurisdictions. Secret ownership in the West by sanctioned oligarchs should no longer be tolerated. Similarly, the West needs to start thinking about how to penalise Western companies that continue to work in Russia and support the Russian government with taxes and other benefits. One reasonable idea is that they be forced to pay penal taxes commensurate to what they pay to Russia.Finally, the EU should start accession negotiations with Ukraine, and NATO should use its 75th anniversary summit in Washington in July to extend a formal membership invitation to Ukraine. A large majority of NATO members already supported doing so at last year’s summit in Vilnius. There is no reason not to follow through this year as part of a broader unified Western strategy.-Project Syndicate \nThe three branches of the government function through a system of check and balance. When one of the executive, the legislative or the judicial branches exceeds its bounds, the others remind it of its constitutional limits. In the post-1990 democratic setup, the judiciary for one has by and large played a positive role in upholding democratic values that had repeatedly come under assault, particularly by the executives who refused to accept any limits on their powers. Yet of late some questionable verdicts of the top court in the country have raised the spectre of a ‘judicial supremacy’. On May 3, a division bench of the Supreme Court raised many eyebrows when it ruled that the Speaker of the Gandaki Provincial assembly should not be counted as an assembly member in the government formation process. So, in the 60-member assembly, even 30 members could constitute a majority. Back in March 2021, in a highly unanticipated decision, deciding what was essentially a petition challenging the party’s name, the court dissolved the ruling Nepal Communist Party. A couple of months later, the court even appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba the new prime minister. As there are disputes on government formation in nearly each of the seven provinces, the Supreme Court could time and again be asked to settle them, just like in Gandaki. That is not all. The decision on judging the legality of the recent split of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also now rests with the top court. What we repeatedly see is that the court is being asked to rule on what are essentially political disputes. If there was even a minimum level of understanding among our major political actors, many of the disputes in the provinces could have been settled among themselves. In other words, it is our major political actors who are inviting judicial activism. This in turn undermines the credibility of the judiciary. Yet that is only one worry. If our political actors continue to turn to the courts to handle all major and minor political disputes, then we should not be surprised if the third branch of the state starts acting more and more arbitrarily. There is then also the risk of the courts being cooped by other power centres, as is the case, say, in our neighbouring Pakistan or Myanmar. In order to uphold its image as a neutral interpreter of the constitution and other laws, the judiciary could do its bit by declining to hear cases of certain nature that are best decided through political dialogue, or through healthy discussions in the sovereign parliament. Our political actors should also learn to act more maturely. Yes, the kind of electoral system the country has is unlikely to ensure a high level of political stability. Yet our politicians cannot get away by putting all the blame on the system. They too must learn to show at least a minimum level of political maturity. Again, the democratic system only works through check and balance. If one organ of the state forgets its duties, the whole system destabilises.   \nAfter a months-long heatwave, the recent rainfall in Nepal brought much-needed relief and helped put out wildfires. Unfortunately, the rainwater, coupled with warmth, also created a favourable environment for dengue-carrying mosquitoes. As a result, dengue cases are already on the rise, with 57 districts reporting dengue infection, and over 50 cases were reported in a single week. Experts believe the worst is yet to come. Even though dengue has taken many lives in the past few years (20 deaths in 2023, 88 in 2022 and six in 2019) and infected many (52,000 in 2023, 54,000 in 2022 and 16,000 in 2019), it remains the most neglected virus. Authorities seem to care little either about its spread or severity. Nor do they try to understand the changing nature of the virus from climate change and rising temperatures through research and tests. A Dengue Action Plan is in place, but the government hasn’t been able to do enough to contain the spread of the virus except relying on traditional methods like surveillance of the virus, serotyping of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes, plus treatment, management and collaboration with local levels. Even the action plan acknowledges that the country’s dengue spread has gone out of hand, making it difficult to contain. Nepal is unable to undertake year-round surveillance and prevention programmes due to budgetary limits. The action plan clearly states that there’s no budget to deal with dengue throughout the year. This was bound to happen as the health ministry’s budget was reduced this fiscal year, discontinuing many programmes. Moreover, even the budget allocated for a particular fiscal year (for example in 2022-23) is used up before March/April, when cases usually surge. These months, as experts suggest, are crucial, as stopping the spread of the virus just when the cases are rising is the most effective way to cut down on the number of deaths and infections throughout the year. Apart from insufficient budget, the country also lacks entomologists, and no other ministry is held responsible for the work except health.The situation will only worsen the longer these challenges are overlooked. And removing the dengue menace should not be the sole responsibility of the health ministry. The finance ministry should allocate enough budget to drive dengue prevention measures for a whole year; the environment ministry can implement environmental policies to control the breeding sites of mosquitoes, and urge people to maintain sanitation and proper waste management; the urban development ministry must manage drainage systems and green spaces; while the transportation ministry needs to prevent the accumulation of stagnant water on roads. Only such a collective measure will help reduce dengue dangers.While continuing with awareness programmes, door-to-door campaigns and search-find-destroy drives should also be pushed on a regular basis. There is a strong case for learning from other countries. For instance, eDengue systems implemented in Malaysia could be used to report cases from rural parts of Nepal and detect severe cases for timely medical intervention. The onus is also on the public to take preventive measures on a year-round basis. Again, dengue is not something that only the government can control. If we don’t work together, many of us will needlessly suffer.  \nSenior leaders from seven major political parties—both the ruling as well as opposition forces—on Sunday made an unequivocal collective pledge to make maximum effort to promote the country’s investment and business climate. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, CPN (Maoist Centre) vice-chair Pampha Bhusal, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden, Rastriya Swatantra Party Chief Whip Santosh Pariyar, CPN (Unified Socialist) General Secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal and Janamat Party chair CK Raut, while airing their respective party’s views at the Kantipur Economic Summit-2024, also emphasised the need for the political forces and other stakeholders to work hand in hand in order to attract investment.It was just two weeks ago that top leaders of the country including Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepali Congress and KP Sharma Oli, chair of a major coalition partner CPN-UML, while addressing the two-day Investment Summit, committed to spare no effort to turn Nepal into an investment-friendly destination. Presenting Nepal as a country of huge potential, the leaders made the promises before 1,600-plus representatives from 55 countries in the government-organised summit. Realisation of the need for domestic as well as foreign investments and joint political commitments of rival political forces in itself is a positive gesture.However this is not enough. Nepal’s politicians have time and again made such promises but failed to translate them into results. For that, Nepal still needs political as well as policy stability and predictability. Various countries have made tremendous progress even when there is instability in government leadership. They did so by keeping development activities separate from politics and ensuring policy predictability, even if there are constant changes in governments. One big concern of the representatives from the business communities expressed at the Kantipur Economic Summit was the same. They said genuine investors seek policy predictability as a prerequisite before making a sizable investment. This is a valid concern and the policy makers must ensure so much.Yet the initiatives of the government and our politicians appear more superficial than substantive. Just ahead of the investment summit, the government amended some Acts through an ordinance to clear legal complexities for investment. It was the government’s intent to create an impression before the international participants that Nepal is serious about getting money from abroad. But the ordinances couldn’t be tabled in the first meeting of the House of Representatives on Friday due to the ongoing obstruction of the main opposition party Nepali Congress. There is a prolonged deadlock in Parliament. The ruling and opposition parties are in a face-off over a parliamentary panel to probe Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The minister is accused of involvement in multiple cooperative frauds. The House obstruction by the main opposition over the demand first made in the winter session has continued even after the commencement of the budget session on May 10. If our political parties cannot even come together to pass the national budget, it would be hard for foreigners to trust us with their money. The only way Nepal will attract quality investment and make a leap in its development endeavour is through a collective political effort to ensure policy consistency. For the country’s larger good, they must also be able to see beyond their partisan interests.  \nAs the midsummer mercury rises, storing fresh food remains a challenge. In a country where the usage of refrigerators remains limited to urban areas, there is a risk of food getting contaminated. Moreover, our general attitude towards food safety and preservation, especially in eateries, is casual. For instance, we see meat shops openly displaying raw meat items all day on tables and showcases, without the use of freezers. Sweet shops and restaurants are no better, as they are tempted to display their food items to attract customers. Even though the food might look appealing to our eyes when it is served in eateries, it is ultimately harmful to our health as many do not follow the proper food safety protocols. The open display of food items invites bacteria and dust contamination, apart from the obvious heat-related hazards, leading to the onslaught of various diseases, including cholera and food poisoning, apart from a lack of nutrition. Although Nepal has food safety regulations in place, the lack of implementation and monitoring continues to pose the risk of food-borne diseases to the public. The Food Act, 2023 (1967) prohibits the production, sale or distribution of adulterated foodstuff or sub-standard foodstuff. By adulterated foodstuff, the Act means \"foodstuffs rotten so as to be harmful to health, or prepared or kept in a filthy or toxic condition\". In January last year, Nepal implemented a new set of food safety regulations, which has provisions for the careful production, processing, packaging, handling, storage and supply purity of food. The regulations also have provisions for labelling the food, including its nutritional value.However, apart from poor implementation of such regulations, the monitoring of the regulations is almost non-existent. In rare instances when food inspectors from municipalities bother to monitor the food in eateries, there is a high chance of such eateries being found flouting the regulations. For instance, in Kathmandu, as in most parts of the country, food items, especially items like meat that get contaminated quickly, are laid out in the open and sold. This causes great health risks, but the authorities of all levels of government seem either oblivious to or uninterested in the issue. In Kathmandu Metropolitan City, for instance, the authorities' focus is on removing the food vendors altogether, guided by a flawed notion of gentrification rather than regulating them under tax and food safety regimes. In other parts of the country, hardly anyone bothers to check the quality of food provided to customers.The state cannot remain a mute spectator when the health of the citizens is put at risk due to the carelessness of vendors. Rather, the state should strictly maintain food safety standards regularly—not in an episodic pattern, such as during festivals or at the whims of authorities but as a standard practice. Some basic steps include making it mandatory for vendors to keep appropriate food items in freezers, use covering, and segregate food items to avoid cross-contamination. As the culture of eating out is becoming increasingly common, especially among young people, the state should actively enforce food preservation and safety regulations to keep the citizens healthy. \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   \nThe budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nPeople lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. \nThe third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit starts today. At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal. \nPolitical parties’ unhealthy activities to form provincial governments has taken the form of an ugly competition and increased the public’s frustration with the provinces. Separately, leaders of major political parties have started to blame the mixed electoral system for Nepal’s perpetual instability. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to political analyst Tula Narayan Shah to discuss these and other related issues.Nepali politics has entered yet another phase of endless bickering over power after the March 4 change of the ruling coalition. Politicians have resorted to every possible tactic to get leadership in provincial governments. How do you analyse this trend?I am not surprised. It is natural in the kind of parliamentary system that we practise. We adopted the parliamentary model in federal and provincial levels while the one at our local level is similar to the presidential system. Local unit chiefs and deputies are elected directly by the people and they can serve five-year terms. That has ensured stability there. Provincial governments on the other hand are destabilised when there is any change at the centre.Leaders have started blaming the electoral system for hung parliaments and instability. Is the problem in the system or with our leaders?Some senior leaders in major parties now blame the electoral system. Even the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Office of the Auditor General have recommended changes in the electoral model, arguing that the current one had promoted corruption in the country. I am not convinced. Politicians argue that no political party could garner a majority in this system and that led to instability. I rather hold politicians’ personal ambition and corrupt political culture responsible. General secretary of a major political party recently argued that it will be better for national politics to be driven by two political parties. Nepal conducted eight general elections (in 1959, in 1991, in 1994, in 1999, in 2008, in 2013, in 2017 and in 2022) under a multi-party system. Forget the 1959 polls. Of the three polls held in the 1990s, the Nepali Congress got majority in 1991 and 1999. Also, during those years, two parties—the Congress and the CPN-UML—dominated Nepali politics. Did a single-party majority and dominance of two parties provide stability? Not at all. Rather, personal rivalries of the Congress leaders invited instability. Fast forward to 2017 elections. The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance and jointly fought elections. They later merged to form the Nepal Communist Party, which had a comfortable majority. Again the rivalry of the top leaders within the party caused instability. These instances show that a majority for a single party doesn’t necessarily translate into stability.I rather see a conspiracy behind blaming the electoral system. In the 1990s, Nepal adopted the first-past-the-post system to elect all lawmakers. Around 70 percent national seats were controlled by two castes—Brahmin and Chhetri. In 2008, we adopted a mixed electoral system, which was a demand of the 2006 people’s movement, the Maoist insurgency and the Madhesh agitation. The proportional representation category significantly increased representation of women, dalits, Madheshi and indigenous communities in the legislature, whereas the representation of the males of Khas-Arya groups, who were historically ruling the country, decreased drastically.Who are those elected the most under the FPTP system?The FPTP electoral system has certain attributes that are more conducive to some groups than others. ‘High-caste males’ win more elections. Females have less of a chance. But dalits also have less chance even if the candidate is male. Those like contractors, landlords and businesspeople who can freely spend win elections. Likewise, those who are well-connected with the power centres in Kathmandu can influence elections. Chhetris and Thakuris were dominant in Panchayat politics. Brahmins got stronger after the 1990 political change. Also those who have access and visibility in media and other public forums have better chances of being elected under the FPTP.Some leaders who have these capabilities have won elections in different systems. There is one Madheshi leader, who won election in Panchayat, got tickets from Congress and won again in the multiparty system. Later he joined a Madhesh-based party and won. So, high-caste males and those with access to power corridors in Kathmandu want FPTP. Whereas, women, dalits and those from marginalised communities prefer PR.A general perception is that those who are directly elected are competent ones and can deliver whereas those from the PR category are there just for the sake of representation. Do you agree?Leaders didn’t pick the candidates properly under the PR category. They picked their loved or loyal ones or sold these seats for hefty monetary returns. Leaders from Madheshi and indigenous communities fought for this system. But the same Madheshi leaders kept the names of their wives, daughters and other family members at the top of the PR list. Thus leaders misused and defamed the electoral system. So, the debate should be focused on correcting the wrong practices, not scrapping the system itself.Provinces replicated all the wrong practices of the centre and did even worse.We adopted the same parliamentary system in provinces. So the same thing happened there. Conversely, local units are different as the system there is different. Therefore, we have to go for directly elected executive heads at the centre as well as provinces. Let’s elect the prime minister and chief ministers directly. That will give us stability. Senior leaders from the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre have proposed changing the electoral system but they haven’t proposed direct election of the prime minister and chief ministers. So, the solution is direct election of executive heads, as in Palikas. Scrapping of the PR system won’t help.What if a wrong person gets elected to the post and can’t be removed for five years?In a democracy, you have to trust the people. Nepali citizens are the ones who removed monarchy. Can’t they unseat a leader elected by their votes? In a direct election, even a person from outside the political parties may emerge. So, politicians are afraid because traditionally they exert control over candidacy and various other things through the parties. Many think of provinces as an unnecessary burden on state coffers. Is that the case?I don’t think so. State restructuring was one of the major demands of the Maoist insurgency, Madhesh movement and the 2006 People’s Movement. Why did they ask for it? Because Nepal was a heavily centralised state and it wasn’t inclusive. Federalisation of the state, inclusive electoral system and reservation quotas in civil service were the three components of state restructuring.But why did the provinces then fail to deliver and win public trust?The stakeholders spent around a decade deciding what type of provinces should be carved out. Even pro-federalists didn’t debate how to make the provinces functional. Those who lobbied in favour of the federal system have now become defensive. Some are silent. The political party [which is led by Upendra Yadav] that fought for the federal system has been leading the government in Madhesh for the past six years. But they haven’t given any relief to the common people through the provincial government. People have an impression that the provincial system has added corruption and it is only for the leaders and their cronies, not the common people.Are the leaders really corrupt or do they lack efficiency?Even the Maoist and Madheshi parties that promised to be different to the Congress and the UML couldn’t come up with a roadmap to make the federal system and state agencies more meaningful for the people. They only indulged in power politics, just like other parties. That frustrated the people.You recently travelled to various parts of Madhesh province. How are the sub-national administrations working and what is the public mood there?A society where people are aware, educated and active helps make leaders as well as administration accountable. Authorities are found to be working arbitrarily in the places where people can’t question their wrongdoing. We find relatively better administration in the mid-hill regions, where Brahmins and Chhetris have dominant presence as they have better understanding of the system, laws and other information. Such a mid-hill area expands from the eastern border to Lumbini Province. In this belt, people can raise questions and make the administration accountable. Women’s status is better while caste-based discrimination is less. Local units, schools, health posts, and administrative units work well. Conversely, these aspects are weak in Karnali, Sudurpaschim, inner Madhesh and in the northern belt as there is no critical mass capable of questioning the authorities.You should understand that there are two Madhesh belts. One is along the East-West Highway, second is the bordering area. The belt along the highway has a diverse social composition. There is dominance of the people who migrated from the hills. Development indicators are better and so is the presence of state agencies. The more you move south, the more you find homogenous populations of Madheshi origin. Traditional power relations haven’t changed there. Patron-client dynamics still stand. Certain individuals have key roles in elections and other important activities. They take the decision on behalf of other common people. We find similar practice in the northern belt as well but not in the mid-hill and highway areas.Many say local units perform better than provinces. What is the perception on the ground?Local level is equipped with needed authority. Provinces should be given powers to make them effective as per the spirit of federalism. The present system was designed by reluctant federalists. Therefore, what we need is a fresh debate on the reforms of provinces. There are two conflicting claims. A section of the society says provinces have misused their authority and failed to deliver. Others say the provinces need more authority for effective functioning.It is true that provinces have failed to use the authority they have. Provinces have their legislatures that prepare their budgets and their governments can implement it. Give me an example of an exemplary and innovative initiative taken by any of the seven provinces in the past six years. Madhesh Province started the ‘Beti Padhau Beti Bachau’ campaign but corruption doomed it. People started raising questions, “why do we need provinces, if the leaders there are to copy the same corrupt activities of the centre?”Madheshi leaders opposed the hill people’s dominance and discriminatory practices in the central administration. But the same Madheshi leaders aren’t promoting an inclusive system in Madhesh. Around 20 percent of the total Madhesh population are dalits. The government in the province has changed multiple times. But how many dalits have been ministers in the provincial Cabinets? There are 136 local units in Madhesh Province. But only one mayor and two deputy-mayors are from the dalit community. Just like a set of elite people has captured Kathmandu’s politics, another set of elites has captured the politics of Janakpur.How do Madheshi people look at provinces?People in Kathmandu, mid-hills, and some other places can be heard saying provinces should be scrapped. Common people in Madhesh don’t say so. But they have dissatisfaction with the parties who championed the federal system. They say, “our lives are the same even in the federal system”.How do you analyse the performance of two new parties in Madhesh—Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti?Overall, three parties emerged from the 2022 elections. The Rastriya Swatantra Party emerged from the areas with a dominant presence of hill people. The Janamat Party won from eastern Tarai and the Nagarik Unmukti Party from the western part of the southern belt. The Janamat says the agenda of discrimination against Madhesh is still relevant but they oppose the leadership of the Janata Samajbadi Party and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The old Madheshi parties spoke against Kathmandu’s discrimination but they themselves didn’t work to remove discrimination when they led the government in Madhesh. Besides, they didn’t speak against bad governance. Now, the Janamat’s agenda is to fight discrimination and bad governance, both by Kathmandu as well as the old Madheshi parties.The RSP’s emergence is against “the bad governance of the Congress and the UML”. Its major agenda is good governance. It doesn’t care about discrimination. But bad governance isn’t an agenda of Nagarik Unmukti. The party that emerged mainly after the Tikapur incident is against the discrimination of Tharu community. The dispute in the party is family-based and the outfit hasn’t taken the form of a political party. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nOur attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email \nWe understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal \nI am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25). I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London \nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.
