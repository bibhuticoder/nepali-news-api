{"title":"Give me a cool title for this story. Just give me title and no other text. \n I will give you a story and the news events from today. \n    Based on news events continue the story and provide me the updated story. In the story cover all the events as much as possible, try to weave them together, making a beautiful story.\n    Be elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings. Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe District Government Attorney Office in Kaski has filed cases against Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane and 30 other individuals at the Kaski District Court in connection with the Suryadarshan Cooperative fraud case.Cooperatives fraud, organised crime and money laundering cases have been filed at the district court against Lamichhane, seeking 15 years of imprisonment and recovery of Rs278.9 million from him.The District Attorney's Office in Kaski submitted a charge-sheet against 44 accused, including Lamichhane. Among them are 31 individuals and eight institutions. Five others have been made defendants so as to confiscate their properties.The attorney’s office states in the charge-sheet that a money laundering case has been filed against Lamichhane as he was involved in transferring deposits from the Suryadarshan Cooperative to his personal bank account as well as the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network, where he was the managing director.However, Lamichhane claimed while recording his statement with the attorney that he had no knowledge of the money transferred to his or the company’s bank accounts from the cooperative. According to the office, former home minister Lamichhane and former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, along with Lila Pachhai, Ram Bahadur Khanal, and Krishna Bahadur Gurung, face charges of cooperatives fraud, organised crime, and money laundering. Additionally, cases have been filed against eight companies involved in the scam, said Khyam Narayan Lamichhane, acting registrar at the court.In the chargesheet, the police determined that as much as Rs1.514 billion needed to be recovered from the accused. The police advised the district attorney to file cases against them on organised crime, cooperatives fraud and money laundering charges. The police investigation report states that in the case of Lamichhane, he should be sentenced to 4 to 6 years in prison for cooperatives fraud, with an additional 50 percent jail term for organised crime, plus 2 to 15 years in prison, as well as a fine amounting to double the embezzled amount for money laundering.Kaski police claimed that Lamichhane was involved in financial transactions of the Gorkha Media Network even after he quit the company as its shareholder and managing director. Police claimed in the chargesheet that the RSP chief issued payments through cheques to various individuals and cooperatives after he disassociated from the company.“This defendant [Lamichhane] issued cheques to various individuals, companies and cooperatives through the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account in Global IME Bank even after he sold the network’s shares. The laboratory test report shows that the signatures in the cheques match Lamichhane’s,” reads the charge-sheet.The charge-sheet claims that Lamichhane, in collusion with Suryadarshan Cooperative’s chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, embezzled the money of the depositors so as to cause losses to the cooperative’s depositors and to benefit himself and the company. In a bid to avert legal action, the accused carried out fake transactions with false details, imaginary names and address, says the charge-sheet.Meanwhile, the Kaski District Police has officially requested Speaker Devraj Ghimire to suspend RSP chair and House of Representatives member Lamichhane from his parliamentary position. The move follows the filing of a chargesheet against Lamichhane under the Money Laundering Prevention Act 2008 in the Kaski District Court.According to Clause 27 of the Money Laundering Prevention Act, Lamichhane is subject to automatic suspension once charges are filed. This clause mandates that officials facing such charges remain suspended until the case is resolved. Speaker Ghimire is expected to make the suspension official by posting a notice on the parliamentary bulletin board, as the House is not currently in session.The Kaski District Court charge-sheet reveals that Lamichhane and his associates allegedly embezzled Rs278.9 million. The charges include cooperatives fraud (with penalties of 4–6 years imprisonment), organised crime (an additional 50 percent jail term), and money laundering (2–15 years imprisonment and fines double the embezzled amount).Lamichhane, who represents Chitwan’s constituency-2 in Parliament and leads the RSP parliamentary party, now faces legal and political challenges as investigations proceed.On Friday, the Kaski District Attorney’s Office had filed a supplementary charge-sheet against Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, chairman of Suryadarshan Cooperative, and 18 others in connection with a large-scale cooperatives fraud case.The charge-sheet, submitted on Friday, includes accusations of organised crime and money laundering alongside the earlier allegations of cooperatives fraud.Lamichhane and Joshi, among others, have been accused of diverting deposits from Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative, Chitwan-based Sahara Cooperative, Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperative and Parsa-based Sano Paila Cooperative to the Gorkha Media Network that ran the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television. Lamichhane, Joshi and Rai, among others, were partners in the media company. Lamichhane quit the media company to join politics in June 2022.A special parliamentary probe panel formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has recommended the concerned government authorities investigate Lamichhane, Rai and Joshi, among others, on charges of cooperatives fraud. \n\nWith the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, the Ministry of Health and Population has stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Nepal reported the latest case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the disease. Nepal confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year, when a 60-year-old foreign national had tested positive.“We have increased health screenings of passengers entering the country from abroad, as per the instruction of the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Kanchhi Maya Twanju, a health worker deployed at the health desk set up at the Tribhuvan International Airport. “We have been instructed to send passengers having fever and those showing symptoms of mpox infection directly to hospitals.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries. Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases.Along with stepping up screening of the passengers entering the country via TIA, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have alerted dermatologists about the risk of an outbreak of mpox virus in the country and have requested them to refer suspected cases for testing,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We will take additional measures following consultations with stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation’s Nepal representatives.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks since it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases of infection can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions, saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.“We didn’t expect that the infected person would come from Saudi Arabia, as there is no outbreak currently,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “This incident shows that the deadly disease may come from any country, and we must remain vigilant and prepare agencies concerned accordingly.”Doctors say preventing an outbreak of the deadly viral disease is not the sole responsibility of a single health agency, and it is impossible to do so.“Every agency and person, including passengers, should shoulder the responsibility and take preventive measures,” Pun stated.Mpox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.Meanwhile, health officials informed that the condition of the infected man is normal and he will remain in hospital isolation for an additional two weeks.They said that they are also working to trace close contacts between the patients on the plane and the taxi driver who took him to the hospital. \nAmending the constitution was a key promise of the seven-point agreement signed between Nepal’s two largest political parties, the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, in early July while forming the government led by KP Sharma Oli. But almost six months on, this ambitious promise remains unfulfilled. Earlier in September, the ruling coalition parties agreed to hold extensive discussions about amending the constitution. The parties said that the amendment process would only proceed after consulting key political parties and stakeholders. Three months after such an agreement, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, speaking at a party function in Kathmandu on Sunday, said a mechanism to amend the constitution would be formed within a few days. Thapa also added that the mechanism would be pragmatic and that amendments would be made cautiously. “The debate on amending the constitution has begun,” Thapa said, ‘Within a few days, Congress and UML will form a mechanism. We will handle this cautiously since there is no room for adventures. We will also have a dialogue with other political parties.” He said that the constitution cannot be amended just because Congress and UML want it. It will be done only after a broad understanding among the Maoist, Madhesi and other political parties. “After reaching an agreement with all parties and stakeholders, we will amend only the minimum provisions to ensure the smooth functioning of the constitution,” Thapa said.“We must create a situation where one political party can run the government for a period. There are some other issues we would like to address through amendments, which will be made with caution,” Thapa added. A fractured election mandate has resulted in political instability at both federal and provincial levels, and calls have grown for constitutional revision to reform the current electoral system.However, leaders of the ruling parties have expressed seemingly differing views regarding the amendment process and the formation of the mechanism. While Congress General Secretary Thapa stressed the need for forming a mechanism within a few days, UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula said they are still discussing the structure of the mechanism.Similarly, speaking in Dang on December 8, UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel had said the amendment of the constitution would only start after the election to the National Assembly, which is a year and a half away.“Our leadership wants consensus among all parties for revising the constitution,” Bartaula told the Post. “However, we have yet to discuss the structure of the mechanism and the nitty gritty of the amendment.” General Secretary Pokharel said the ruling parties do not have two-thirds majority in the National Assembly so the agenda of amending the constitution cannot move forward until they have the required majority in the upper house.”At present, the ruling coalition cannot win the support of the CPN (Maoist Centre) on the issue of amending the constitution, therefore, amendment will be possible only after the power equation in the upper house shifts after its next election, Pokharel argued. Maoist Centre has seen the agreement between Congress and UML to amend the constitution with suspicion.Although the ruling coalition has a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives, it falls short in the National Assembly. The Congress-UML needs the support of at least 40 members in the 59-member upper house. While the Congress commands the seats of 16, UML has 10 members in the Upper House, which makes the coalition short of 14 lawmakers for the two-thirds majority. The Maoist Centre is the largest party in the upper house with 17 seats, and the coalition partners will need the support of all other political parties in the National Assembly if Maoist Centre refuses to pass any amendment. One-third of the National Assembly's members are elected every two years. The last election was in January; the next will be in January 2026 if the Congress-UML coalition survives until then. And even in a best-case scenario, where the two parties won all one-third of the seats up for grabs, they would only win 19 out of the 59-member assembly. Currently, the Congress-UML has 26 seats in the National Assembly. When one-third of the seats are vacant, the number of seats for both parties will also decrease. This means the coalition is not guaranteed to reach a comfortable two-thirds majority without the support of other fringe parties even after the next National Assembly election. What then? Political experts, therefore, believe that numerical strength alone won’t work. The constitution can be amended if the two ruling parties with a strong majority in the House of Representatives intend to do so. Congress and UML indeed have a strong majority in the House. With a few smaller forces backing, they can manage the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution,” Professor of Political Science Krishna Khanal said in the latest interview with the Post. “However, when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So, numerical strength alone won’t work.” He further says the constitutional amendment has not progressed in the past five months because the political parties have used it to get to power without genuine commitment to reform.  \nThe scan and pay system for Nepali travellers in India planned for this December will likely be delayed due to a commission issue, according to an operator privy to this matter.“In India, no charges are levied when paying through the quick response (QR) code. But when Nepalis start paying via QR code in India, a certain commission should be paid to Nepali banks for this service,” one payment operator said, wishing not to be named.“Now, who will pay the commission as merchants provide the service without charges?”There is no regulation regarding commissions or charges to be paid to Nepali banks on every transaction.In Nepal, when Indian travellers pay through the QR code, minimal standard charges of 1.95 percent are applied to merchants per transaction upon receiving payment via UPI-enabled payment apps. Consumers or merchants are not charged for payments from UPI-linked bank accounts. The UPI, or Unified Payments Interface, is an instant real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to facilitate inter-bank transactions through mobile phones.In India, when a wallet user makes a payment, the merchant acquirer pays the interchange fee to the wallet issuer. Whether the acquirer will pass this fee to the merchant has not been determined. The interchange fee of up to 1.1 percent applies only on transactions above IRs2,000 to online merchants and large retailers. Furthermore, interchange fees do not apply to peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and small businesses in the P2PM category.India has mandated a zero-charge framework for UPI transactions from January 1, 2020. This means that UPI charges are nil for users and merchants alike.This issue in Nepal has delayed the activation of QR codes for Nepali travellers in India. This is a major hurdle to Nepalis making QR code payments in India, the source added.Operators say multiple discussions have been held regarding the commission issue, including the amount or percentage of the commission to be provided to Nepali banks and who will bear the cost. But there has been no logical conclusion so far.“India’s central bank is also discussing the issue with banks there,” according to the operator.“So it will still take a few months for Nepalis to make QR code payments in India.” Nepal is technically ready to start QR payments in India with approval from Nepal’s central bank. However, unless the Indian side gives a go-ahead, Nepal cannot start the QR payment in India.Nepal even has already conducted a successful trial transaction in India.In September, Nabil Bank trialled transactions through its mobile banking app in Mumbai, India, and achieved a successful result.The Reserve Bank of India needs to provide approval for payment system operators, and banks also need to show their readiness to start the service, operators said.On June 1 last year, Nepal and India signed a memorandum of understanding for cross-border digital payment to ease digital transactions for business people, students, and tourists from both countries.Nepal Clearing House Limited (NCHL) and National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) International Payments Limited signed and exchanged the memorandum of agreement on behalf of their respective organisations in New Delhi, India.The digital remittance under cross-border digital payment service initiated through a government-to-government agreement has also been delayed from the Indian side.NCHL agreed to a cross-border digital remittance service. However, a year after the agreement, the service has yet to start.NCHL has a 10 percent investment from Nepal Rastra Bank and 90 percent from other commercial banks.The central bank handed NCHL the work of establishing and operating a national payment switch and card.In September last year, Fonepay Payment Service Ltd, Nepal’s largest payment network and NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), the international arm of the National Payments Corporation of India, agreed to launch the first QR code-based payment solution between Nepal and India.On March 1, Indians in Nepal were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones.The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes. The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash as the Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.Fonepay said that initially it received transactions of Rs2–3 million daily. Now it reaches around Rs7–8 million daily on weekends or during the tourist season and around Rs5 million daily on normal days.Indians making QR code payments in Nepal are gradually growing as many Indians still do not know about the service availability in Nepal, said Fonepay.Nepal Rastra Bank has imposed rules and regulations for banks to set a daily transaction limit of IRs100,000 while making QR code payments in India. \nThe government has withdrawn a controversial provision from the ‘Bill to amend some Nepal Acts’ that envisioned allowing the withdrawal of criminal cases committed under political cover.The Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on May 10 last year had registered the bill at the Parliament Secretariat to amend Section 116 of the Criminal Procedure Code-2017 so as to clear the hurdles to withdrawing insurgency-era cases of “political nature”.Section 64 of the amendment bill has a provision that says cases sub judice in any court against anyone from a party or a group that conducted violent protests in the past but is carrying out its activities peacefully now, based on the constitution and the law can be withdrawn.In the bill, the government has added a sub-section under section 116 of the code, which ultimately aims at withdrawing the cases from all tiers of courts—Supreme, High and District—against political leaders. Participating in the discussion over the bill in the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives on Sunday, Law Minister Ajay Kumar Chaurasiya said that Section 64 of the bill had been drawn.“It has to be withdrawn as it might lead to impunity,” said the minister, adding that the decision was made with consent from Dhanraj Gurung, who in the capacity of law minister had registered the bill.Prior to Chaurasiya, Uday Raj Sapkota, secretary at the ministry, had revealed that the government had decided to withdraw the provision.The government holds the authority to produce the bill. It can also withdraw any bill or a part with consent from Parliament. Though a majority of lawmakers welcomed the government’s move, those from the CPN (Maoist Centre) objected to it. Claiming that the provision was introduced to implement past agreements with political forces such as those led by CK Raut and Netra Bikram Chand. Maoist lawmakers have threatened to register notes of dissent if the provision is withdrawn. “The government, in the past, signed deals with different political forces agreeing to withdraw the charges against them. It is the government's responsibility to abide by the agreements,” said Ram Kumar Rai, a Maoist Centre lawmaker.“In fact, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli, who also leads the government now, had forged the agreement. Instead of implementing it, the government is withdrawing the provision.”The preparations by the Dahal government to amend the Criminal Procedure Code had landed into controversy for suspicions that it was aimed at withdrawing the insurgency-era cases of atrocities.Even the National Human Rights Commission, organising a press meet, had objected to the move saying it was deeply concerned about the amendment bill. It argued there was a high possibility that the amendment would lead to the withdrawal of conflict-era charges of human rights violations by giving them political colour.The commission also sought the government’s clarification on the matter though the Dahal administration didn’t respond to it. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has received 63,718 complaints. Separately, 3,223 cases were lodged with the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, the disappearance commission is investigating only 2,484 cases saying that others do not fall under its jurisdiction.There are also several cases under consideration in various courts against Maoist Centre leaders and security personnel in connection with the crimes committed during the decade-long insurgency. If the bill got through Parliament, it would give a legitimate way for the government to arbitrarily withdraw the cases.After months-long gap, the House committee has resumed deliberation over the bill that has been under consideration for one-and-a-half years. As the government prepares to call the winter session of federal parliament in January, the Speaker, along with the government, wants the House committees to forward the bills, with them, to the plenary.Sixteen bills are under consideration in various parliamentary committees, also called mini parliaments. \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) was formed in August 2021 by a group of dissident CPN-UML leaders including two former party chiefs and ex-prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal. The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders. We are thinking of concluding this process [of welcoming him] soon.What about Bhim Rawal joining the party?Unhappy with the party leadership, he has been inactive in the UML but he has not made up his mind to join our party.Is finalising Gautam’s hierarchy and role in the party taking time?There won’t be an issue in the case of Bamdev ji. But overall, the number of leaders in our party is big. In the Chinese Communist Party, there are only seven members in the Politburo Standing Committee and 17 members in Other Politburo Members. But there are 24 members in our party’s central secretariat, 41 in the standing committee and 108 members in the politburo. Those who get a candidacy in the election celebrate but those who don’t get a ticket become inactive. Some others fight for ministerial posts. Yet others complain about not getting a ‘lucrative’ ministry. We have to manage them all.What about reunifying the party with the UML or the Maoist Centre? Many say leaders are more comfortable with the Maoist Centre but party cadres are for rejoining the UML.Most of our cadres are from the UML background. That might have played a role. But at present there is no possibility of our reunification with the UML. Also, the situation isn’t right to forge unity with the Maoist Centre.It is said that there is pressure from party members for reunification with the UML?That’s not true. There is a negative view about us in the UML and therefore our party rank and file wouldn’t be ready to surrender. Some might be lobbying for entry into the UML for personal benefits. Even if some join the UML, it won’t be easy for them there.But some noted leaders such as Ram Kumari Jhakri who had strongly supported you in the course of building this party have said that the Unified Socialist can’t run like this and that it is better to merge with the UML?I also enquired about her remarks but she said her intent had been misunderstood. But I repeat that there is no possibility of unity with the UML. We studied the possibility of unity with the Maoist Centre but concluded that we can’t accept Maoism and we also found their election symbol inappropriate. So the process has stopped. For now, we will concentrate on strengthening our own party.How is the Unified Socialist different from the UML?Our’s is a policy-driven party and not leader-centric. Committee system prevails in our organisation, not the leader’s orders. We discard rightist approaches and follow revolutionary ideas. We don’t see these qualities in the UML. Only our party has a policy of ‘Socialism with Nepali Characteristics’. We prioritise our agenda based on justice, fair distribution, production and good governance. There was a period when socialism stressed only on equality and therefore some termed it a distribution of poverty but we believe socialism as a principle of prosperity. Capitalism focuses only on profits even at the cost of people’s lives and wars but socialism values people’s lives and livelihoods. So, we are clearly against capitalism and in favour of socialism. But there are different forms of capitalism. We are for promoting national capitalism and eliminating comprador capitalists. We need to invite and welcome foreign investment to increase production in the country.Your party held its general convention in July first week and it took months to elect other office bearers and assign roles and responsibilities. Why?It shouldn’t have happened. Some wrong elements entered our party. Some showed immaturity by raising the issue of ‘new generation’. That spoiled the situation. Building a party is not easy. It calls for many things including ideological clarity, capacity to lead the organisation efficiently and an accepted personality. We have to learn from this episode and remove the mistrust that cropped up in this course. \nThe Maoist party, which joined mainstream politics by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006, has always had a peculiar relation with semantics. In the insurgency days, the top Maoist leaders were not known by their real names but their noms de guerre. Partly, this was done to hide their identity, and partly, it was their way of overcoming individualism and pursuing a larger cause. Thus Pushpa Kamal Dahal became ‘Prachanda’, Baburam Bhattarai ‘Laldhoj’, Barsha Man Pun ‘Ananta’ and so on. The party has itself undergone various name changes to arrive at its current avatar of CPN (Maoist Centre). There are often rumours of the party leaders mulling removing the ‘Maoist’ tag. Despite this seeming flexibility, it must hurt all those involved in the decade-long war when the country’s top court repeatedly rejects their attempts to recognise the janayuddha (‘people’s war’). Most recently, the apex court ruled that it is unconstitutional to use the term in official documents. A year ago, it had rejected the-then Maoist-led government’s efforts to declare a public holiday on ‘People’s War Day’. With their strongest claim to political space—a self-sacrificing war waged for the benefit of the downtrodden and the marginalised communities—legally rejected, the use of violence that took nearly 17,000 lives, and left countless more disabled and ‘disappeared’, will be questioned even more in the days ahead. The Maoists and a section of the intelligentsia continue to talk up the war’s achievements: There would apparently have been no republican federal state without the war. Or a system of reservations for the marginalised communities. (Even this newspaper acknowledges the Maoist role in these developments.) Yet it is as important to factor in the party’s evolution in the post-war years. The causes that the party once held dear—particularly issues of the poorest and most marginalized sections of the society—have repeatedly been sacrificed at the altars of Dahal’s naked quest for power. These days, there is little to choose between the Maoist Centre and the old ‘bourgeois’ parties in the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML that the former rebels once held responsible for all social ills. Times are also changing. Those born in the past three decades have little or no memory of the war. Instead, they have seen how its supposed achievements have been endlessly abused by leaders from across the political spectrum. For these younger folks, the idea of getting political legitimacy through a war waged in the name of Mao—a bloodthirsty dictator from another time and place—just does not sound right. Of late, the CPN (Maoist Centre) party has been making much of its ‘stellar’ showing in the recent bypolls. This, say party leaders, is an indication that their popularity is again on the up. That is unlikely. These small pockets of electoral success aside, indications are that people are highly dissatisfied by the functioning of the Maoist party as well as its chair Dahal. The loss in support among its once core constituencies is particularly alarming. Unless the Maoist leadership is ready to internalise and acknowledge how it has let these constituencies down and to commit to rectifying its mistakes, an electoral comeback looks tough. Unfortunately, for Dahal and his followers, there is no going back to the old-school janayuddha either.   \nHow Gagan Thapa wishes there were more than 24 hours in a day! He would then be able to meet most of his social obligations. As preparations get underway for the next Nepali Congress general convention, due at the end of 2025, the party general secretary is routinely inundated with meeting requests. Cadres start lining up outside his Ratopul home early in the morning as Thapa, holed up in the kitchen inside, is busy packing tiffin boxes for his two girls. Now 48, the ex-health minister believes the 15th general convention will be a make or break event for him. He has seen some erosion in his fame following the entry of new forces in Nepali politics. The best way to stem this slide would be to win the party presidency and go into the next general elections as the party’s prime ministerial face.Given the fast pace of change in national politics, he might not get another shot at leading the party—or the country as prime minister. This is why he is keen on mending ties with current President Sher Bahadur Deuba. As things stand, the incumbent president could have the final say in the pick of his successor. “I believe there is an undeclared understanding between the two: Deuba will next lead the government, and Gagan will look after party affairs,” says a trusted adviser of Thapa. In this telling, Deuba realises the futility of pushing his wife, Arzu Rana Deuba, up the party hierarchy. She is not a popular figure among the Congress rank and file. So the best bet for Arzu’s continued relevance in the party is to get Thapa to agree to ‘adjusting’ her in some role after Deuba steps down. In case Thapa declines to do so, the desperate husband might conceivably offer a similar bargain to other aspirants for party presidency. Some say the five-time prime minister, the political animal that he is, will not quietly bow out of politics even after he relinquishes the party chair. That he will continue to pull the strings from behind the curtain. That is unlikely. Deuba’s influence in the party, now at its apogee, will at once decline when he is no longer in a position to dole out plum ministries and party posts. Coming back to Thapa, for all his strengths, it would be a mistake to assume the party presidency will fall into his lap. If, for example, Shekhar Koirala is in the fray, Thapa will be going toe to toe with a formidable foe. “In my reckoning, Koirala can beat Thapa if the two face off in the general convention,” says Tula Narayan Shah, a keen political observer while cupping a glass of steaming peach black tea. The general convention representatives vote in blocks. Shah, a Nepali Congress footsoldier in his student days, thinks the Koirala name still carries a lot of weight for many such Congressi blocks. “Or how could Shashank get the most votes in the election for central committee members in the last general convention? What other qualification did he have?” Also working in Koirala’s favour will be his long preparation for the top job— “while never holding a government portfolio,” Shah adds. Moreover, many in the Congress believe that while Thapa has age on his side, and will get another shot in the future, Koirala, at 74, may not have that luxury. But even the first-level elections to choose Congress general convention delegates have not started. It would thus be premature to talk of new factions which will only start solidifying around a handful of leaders at the end of 2025. The likes of Purna Bahadur Khadka and Bimlendra Nidhi, another two aspirations for the top job who too are long-time Deuba acolytes, would have some say in how things shape up. So would Shashank Koirala and Prakash Man Singh. Yet a compelling case can be made for why the Congress would do well to go into the next general elections under Gagan Thapa. With the country looking for a clean break from the past, this next generation leader with sound intellect and unmatched oratory will be a good electoral fit. He also has a clean image. Again, no other top Congress leader is anywhere close to the MP from Kathmandu-4 on any of these fronts. Yes, Thapa’s popularity has gone down. But if he gets to lead the party again, he is more than capable of regaining much of the lost lustre. A leader who is always in the spotlight is bound to get into some controversies. As has Thapa. Someone who came to prominence during the 2006 April Revolution, he can sometimes sound more like a rabble-rouser than a cool-headed thinker. Really, when you have natural swag, why sweat it? His relations with the party chief have also come under scrutiny. Even though Deuba has made one after another mistake, Thapa has blunted his criticism of the party president. Thapa quietly accepted the seven-point midnight Congress-UML deal even though he, the party’s general secretary, was kept in complete darkness. A consummate politician, Thapa is clearly biding his time. But this also shows he thinks long term—always a good sign in a political leader.It would be hard to argue that the Congress and the larger Nepali polity will be better served with the party electing Shekhar Koirala or any other leader of the older generation than it will be by picking Thapa. If Thapa comes to power in the Congress, the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, the other two big parties, will also be forced to rethink their ossified leaderships: The UML is now under the thumb of KP Sharma Oli, just like Pushpa Kamal Dahal continues to maintain an absolute grip over the Maoist Centre. At this juncture, of the three major forces, the Congress appears by far the most democratic outfit. A seamless transfer of power to the torchbearer of the next generation will reinforce this image.  \nWomen play important roles in the lives of their husbands. In this column, I allude to the rare tales of remarkable women who reveal some unexplored aspects of literary writers and the influence these women had in their lives. This is evident from the stories of the wives of writers like Leo Tolstoy, PB Shelley, Laxmi Prasad Devkota and others mentioned in this article. Besides the women whose interviews are available, I would like to mention the roles of three notable women: Mandakini, Balakrishna Sama’s wife; Sushila Koirala, BP Koirala’s wife; and Manu Kumari Thapa, Lain Singh Bangdel’s wife.Creating Sushila Koirala’s character in my play Sandajuko Mahabharat (2015) was challenging. BP extensively mentioned her in his autobiographical writings. I briefly spoke with Sushilaji about Sama’s play, Ma, which she had directed and performed in Biratnagar in 1951, for which she is called the first Nepali woman director of a play. Sama clearly mentions Mandakini and her impact on his life. Her portraits, which he executed, can be seen in his house. Poet Kedar Man Vyathit once told me the Sama couple looked like a pair of doves. I know Manu didi’s impact on Bangdelji very well and have also written about her.This theme of women’s contribution has struck me for a few reasons. First, I met these women through my relationship with the writers. Second, I met some of them while Bindu Subedi, the story writer and editor of the Nepali section of the English-Nepali quarterly magazine Across, conducted their recorded interviews. She published the interviews of the wives of eight writers and poets under a telling and critical title, “These forgotten wives—birsieka shrimatiharu—of the late literary writers”, in two issues of the magazine. These interviews unfold the tales of the women who played significant roles in the lives of their writer husbands. It was a great privilege for me to attend some of these interviews. It gave me a chance to understand the power of these women and the ethics and challenges of the times they closely experienced. I was overwhelmed to hear how their influence on their husbands helped create the celebrated literary works. I especially recall meeting Mana Devi Devkota, wife of the eminent poet Laxmi Prasad Devkota, and Mishri Devi Shrestha, wife of poet Siddhicharan Shrestha. The other women interviewed in Across (February-April 1999) are Jyotsna Vyathit, poet Kedar Man Vyathit’s wife, and the wife of writer Keshav Raj Pindali. Ratna Lamichhane and Subarnaa Lamichhane, the wives of Shankar Lamichhane; Shova Aryal, wife of Bhairab Aryal; and Kanti Sherchan, wife of Bhupi Sherchan, are interviewed in another issue of the magazine (August-October 2001). Last year, I had the privilege of meeting Kantiji at the launch of the book Bhupi: A Daughter’s Memoir by Kavita Sherchan, Bhupi’s daughter. Only two remarkable women, Subarnaa Lamichhane and Kanti Sherchan, are alive today. Ratna and Subarnaa fondly speak about Lamichhane from individual perspectives, and their interviews show compassion. Ratna was deeply familiar with Shankar’s writings and his problems. Shova Aryal makes an interesting observation about her husband, Bhairav Aryal, who was famous for satire and humour in his writings. She says, “Gautama Buddha had left home leaving his wife Yashodhara and son Rahul behind, but our humour writer chose to die by leaving six children from the age of thirteen to two and a half, and a wife in the lurch.” In her interview, Kanti Sherchan praised Bhupi’s humanism, his sense of freedom and dedication to his work. These women’s stories about the condition of the writers’ angst, their inspirations and the times they fought with are rare studies for critics and researchers. The interviewer, Bindu Subedi, has written the following about the qualities and the enduring passion and compassion of the wives of the writers. These women, who bore the children and brought them up, fought minuscule battles in each case, sometimes too hard. They dealt with their husbands’ moods, hid their pain behind smiles, supported them through their most difficult phases of life and preserved their writings. Some of them even established awards in their husbands’ names, stayed beside them when they were ill and served and helped them. However, the writers have not written much in acknowledgement of the sacrifice of their wives. There are some exceptions, though. Siddhicharan Shrestha has written a poem about Mishridevi, and Vyathit often mentions Jyotsna’s name in his poems. Lain Singh Bangdel’s gratitude towards Manu is seen throughout his works. But literary critics do not mention these women’s contributions in their critical writings. When they do, they distort. The interviewer claims that this becomes clear after listening to these women.Mana Devi Devkota, who was 87 at the time of the interview in 2001, looked bright, confident and ready to share how she had been a good companion to her husband, Laxmi Prasad Devkota. I also went to see her then; I did not talk much with her except to express my pleasure to have met her. Devkota’s life was full of events and stories about writing. His lifestyle and writing habits are also interesting. Devkota, the editor of Yugvani, which was supposed to be an anti-Rana publication, went to Banaras with the anti-Rana rebels, whom Mana Devi Devkota referred to as ‘congress’. Mana Devi recounts a rare story to Bindu Subedi about how she went to Banaras to rescue the poet and safely brought him home. She faced several difficulties, and the ‘congress party’ people didn’t cooperate, as they were unhappy with her for taking Devkota back home. In addition to experiencing financial challenges in bringing him back and continuing their life, she also had to face the wrath of the Rana regime.These women have inspired their husbands at all the important moments. The structuralism of these women’s help is based on the male-centric praxis. The commonality between all these women is that they helped their husbands by being with them during their difficult and happy moments. Being physically present by listening to their writings and perennially inspiring them during hard times is obviously a daunting task.  \nIn today’s world, physical and mental health have emerged as major issues. Stress, anxiety and depression have become all too common. Similarly, physical ailments such as cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure and weakened immune systems are on the rise.Scientific research shows that stress negatively impacts the immune system. It makes individuals more vulnerable to diseases and contributes to other mental health problems like anxiety, depression and insomnia. Research reports also reveal that anxiety and depression significantly impair mental health by causing difficulties in work performance, affecting relationships and leading to social isolation, hopelessness and suicidal impulses. A recent World Health Organization report reveals that an estimated 5 percent of adults worldwide suffer from depression and mental health issues, which are the primary reasons behind the global suicide rate of over 700,000 deaths each year. In the wake of this situation, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution recognising December 21 as World Meditation Day. The day marks the importance of meditation, which has proven effective in reducing stress, promoting healing, increasing energy and thereby promoting peace and well-being in the world. This milestone was achieved through the strong advocacy of countries like Nepal, India, Liechtenstein, Sri Lanka and Mexico. This initiative has historical significance for Nepal. Meditation dates back to the Vedic civilisation, when rishis (sages) practised it in the Himalayas to attain spiritual wisdom and enlightenment. Lord Shiva, often revered as the first meditator, is connected to Nepal through sacred sites like Pashupatinath Temple. Gautam Buddha, who achieved enlightenment through deep meditation, further reinforced this connection to meditation. Moreover, meditation has remained central to the spiritual practices of Hinduism and Buddhism over the centuries, continuously shaping the country’s spiritual landscape. Current initiatives and prospectsThe Government of Nepal has recognised the significance of yoga, meditation and swajagaran (self-alerted awakening). It has incorporated meditation (along with yoga) into its policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2080-81, emphasising its role in key areas such as public administration, education, health, tourism and social development. The goal of this inclusion, as stated in the document, is to develop a healthy and ethical society across all three tiers of government—federal, provincial and local.Some local governments are now implementing this vision at the grassroots by developing localised school curricula that include yoga and meditation. This initiative is promising because research conducted among the younger generation and school-goers worldwide has shown that meditation and yoga help improve their attention span and are instrumental in managing stress and emotional control. Additionally, these practices increase optimism and improve creativity and intelligence. Further, yoga supports physical health by improving blood flow and detoxification, while meditation helps manage pain and become mindful. These practices work together to support the mental and physical health of the younger generation. This momentum is also reflected in Nepal’s growing interest in wellness tourism. Nepal's landscapes and spiritual heritage attract tourists who want to do yoga and meditation and experience Ayurveda and spa treatments in tranquil settings. Though few, there are hotels and resorts, Ayurveda hospitals, yoga trekking opportunities and specified places for yoga and meditation, such as yoga homes, ashrams and academies in and around Kathmandu. This trend establishes Nepal as a global hub for wellness tourism.Nepal can unlock greater promises in the future by integrating meditation, yoga and swajagaran campaigns in various areas of society. Notably, these efforts also align with Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims to ensure “good health and well-being.” Similarly, incorporating these practices into an ethical society can bring long-term benefits. Extending these practices into politics, administration and the private sector will also promote a mindful and ethically responsible society.Finally, integrating these practices can preserve Nepal’s cultural heritage and address modern-day challenges. Nepal can strengthen international relations, improve public health, address sustainability efforts, promote tourism and help achieve global peace by positioning itself as a global advocate for wellness through yoga and meditation, Way forwardStrong coordination between the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, media and Non-Resident Nepalis is very important to strengthen Nepal’s position as a global destination for wellness tourism. Nepal can attract more tourists seeking spiritual growth and wellness by spreading messages internationally. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, in consultation with its stakeholders, can be central in integrating yoga, meditation and swajagaran into school and university programmes. Academic institutions should now take the lead in teaching the art of staying alert by equipping learners with the skills to reflect inward and turn to themselves for clarity and balance. Such integration develops self-awareness and emotional resilience among learners and prepares them for personal and societal challenges. \nSocial activist Sunita Danuwar, a prominent advocate for trafficking survivors, passed away on Monday morning. She was 47. Her husband, Nrip Danuwar, said she was healthy on Sunday night but failed to wake up on Monday morning. “She was fine when we went to bed after dinner on Sunday. The alarm rang at 5:30am, and I tried to wake her up, but she didn’t respond. Her hands were cold,” Nrip said. “We took her to the hospital by 5:45am, but the hospital declared her dead.” Danuwar was a trafficking survivor and the founder and former president of Shakti Samuha. Since its establishment in 1996, the organisation has been empowering returnee trafficking survivors by providing shelter, legal aid, counselling, and vocational training. She also authored the book ‘Aansuko Shakti’. Her body has been kept at Nepal Medical College, Jorpati. She will be cremated at Pashupati Aryaghat after her family arrives from Udayapur. Born on July 16, 1977, in Dailekh, Danuwar was honoured with the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2013 and the C-10 Award in 2014.  \nStarbucks workers have expanded their strike to four more US cities, including New York, the union representing over 10,000 baristas said late on Saturday.The five-day strike, which began on Friday and initially closed Starbucks cafes in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle, has added locations in New Jersey, New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis, Workers United said in a statement. It did not specify in what New Jersey city the walkout was occurring.Starbucks said the disruptions from the strike have no significant impact on its operations because only a small handful of US stores have been impacted.“Workers United proposals call for an immediate increase in the minimum wage of hourly partners by 64%, and by 77% over the life of a three-year contract. This is not sustainable,” the coffee chain said.The union is striking in 10 cities, also including Columbus, Ohio; Denver and Pittsburgh, during the busy holiday season that may impact the company’s Christmas sales.The company operates more than 11,000 stores in the United States, employing about 200,000 workers.Talks between Starbucks and the union hit an impasse with unresolved issues over wages, staffing and schedules, leading to the strike.Workers United warned on Friday that the strike could reach “hundreds of stores” by Tuesday, Christmas Eve.Starbucks began negotiations with the union in April. It said this month it had conducted more than eight bargaining sessions, during which 30 agreements had been reached. \nAcross Delhi, large billboards have come up wooing Indian travellers for a Disney cruise in Singapore, and some people are sitting up and taking notice.One family saw that bookings had begun for the Disney Adventure, the first Asia-based cruise ship of the Disney Cruise Line. To their disappointment, however, it is due to set sail in December 2025.“We thought it was starting this year and even made inquiries. But it’s only starting next year,” said Ms Karishma Mohan, 39, a mother of two children under the age of seven. The family is now considering a trip to Japan in March 2025.However, they are still keen on the Disney cruise, said Ms Mohan, a home baker whose husband works in the aviation sector. “The children have seen the advertisements, including on YouTube, so we will explore next year,” she said.The Mohans are among the growing ranks of middle-class Indian families who go on at least one overseas trip a year.“As consumers in India express their desire to increase spending on travel, the industry is set for healthy growth in coming years,” said Mr Abhay Prakash Singh, research analyst at Euromonitor International, a global business intelligence, market analysis and consumer insights firm.While Chinese tourists may still be the leader in global tourism spending, India is seen as the fastest-growing market for outbound tourism, expected to grow at 11 per cent annually for the next decade.Indian travellers went from 14th position globally on tourism spending in 2019 to eighth place by 2023, when 28.2 million Indians took overseas holidays and spent US$34.2 billion (S$46.3 billion), according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.In comparison, 87 million Chinese travelled overseas in 2023, spending US$196.5 billion, according to UN tourism data.The outlook for Indian travellers, however, remains robust. They are expected to become the fourth-largest global travel spenders by 2030, according to a report by Booking.com and McKinsey.Indians are expected to spend US$55.4 billion by 2034, according to another report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.Tourism is being fuelled by a growing middle class – expected to double by 2047 from the current 432 million – amid increasing disposable incomes, a stronger desire to travel and expanding aviation links.The last factor means they can go farther afield.“Interestingly, prior to the pandemic in the year of 2019, the Asia-Pacific region held the biggest share of outbound spending by Indian travellers,” said Euromonitor’s Mr Singh. “However, in 2023, the Middle East and Africa region dominated, with close to one-third share in overall outbound spending by Indians.”Ms Sanchari Ganguly, 39, is one who likes the path less travelled.Her next holiday is a toss-up between Finnish Lapland and a driving trip through Lithuania and Latvia in the Baltics.“I want a unique experience as well as to discover a new country,” she said.Ms Ganguly, who left her job to look after her son, added: “I am just trying to figure out if Lapland is doable with a five-year-old. I am doing my research right now.”Her family spends 10 per cent of their annual income, which translates to around 500,000 rupees (S$7,970) to 550,000 rupees, on their yearly overseas vacation.Ms Ganguly, whose husband is a banker, had planned to visit Singapore for the Taylor Swift concert earlier in 2024. But when she could not get hold of tickets, the family travelled in June to Georgia and Azerbaijan instead.“We do one big overseas trip every year, and if it’s very expensive, it’s the only trip that we will do. After all, we are a single-income household right now. Otherwise, we do small breaks within India,” she said. “I want my son to travel. Now he asks, ‘Where are we going?’”‘They want more experiences’According to travel-banking fintech platform Niyo, 58 countries now offer visa-free or visa-on-arrival facilities for Indian tourists.It also found that nearly half of Indian travellers made last-minute plans for foreign holidays, landing on countries that offered the easiest visa regime.While the Indian passport is relatively weak, according to the widely cited Henley Passport Index, an increasing number of countries appear to be wooing Indian tourists with an eye on the growing potential.The Henley index for 2024, for instance, ranks India 84th in the world, with visa-free access to 58 countries. This puts it behind Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Madagascar, Gabon and Burkina Faso.The index ranks Singapore as having the strongest passport, with access to 195 countries.Still, in 2024, Indian tourists became eligible for online visas for Japan; five-year, multi-entry visas for Dubai; and visas on arrival in Indonesia and Iran, among other destinations.More countries are expected to follow suit in 2025, with growing aviation links further boosting travel.In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia launched a “Shaandaar (spectacular in Hindi) Saudi” campaign, hoping to attract 7.5 million Indians over the next decade as it diversifies its economy to include tourism.Indian carriers such as Air India and Indigo, which are expanding their fleets, have also been rolling out more routes, both within India and overseas.Air India in 2024 started flights five days a week between Delhi and Hanoi in Vietnam, which in 2023 was the top destination searched for on Google by Indians.“The advent of low-cost carriers on international routes, offering direct connectivity, has further boosted outbound travel from India,” noted Mr Pushan Sharma, director of research at Crisil Market Intelligence and Analytics.“Emerging tourism destinations like Tbilisi, Bali, Male, Almaty, Tashkent, Hanoi and Baku are also now more accessible.”Mr Subhash Goyal, founder chairman of STIC Travel Group, said: “Indian tourists are sought after. And we don’t have backpackers. It is the upper middle class and super rich who are travelling.”He said that previously, “people used to go sightseeing. Today, they want more experiences. They will participate in some festivals, join in some cultural programmes and experience local cuisine and culture”.Countries are also trying to woo Indian tourists with curated experiences.SriLankan Airlines, for example, has introduced a special tour package for Indian visitors called the “Ramayana Trail”, with travel to spots connected to the Hindu epic.Singapore still a favouriteIn 2022, according to India’s Tourism Ministry, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was the top destination for Indians, followed by Saudi Arabia, the US, Singapore and Britain.Singapore’s growing appeal as a top destination for Indians still holds, noted Mr Markus Tan, Singapore Tourism Board’s (STB) regional director for India, the Middle East, South Asia and Africa, in an interview with The Straits Times.For 2024, Singapore welcomed one million visitors from India by October, an approximate 12 per cent increase from the same period in 2023, said Mr Tan, with expectations that year-end figures would reach 1.17 million to 1.2 million Indian tourists.According to data by Indian online travel company MakeMyTrip on travel search and booking trends between Dec 16 and 31 for year-end travel in 2024, Singapore ranks as the third-most searched-for destination on the platform, with searches up 11 per cent year on year. It ranks behind UAE and Thailand.India is Singapore’s third-largest source market for tourism as at Oct 31, after China and Indonesia. STB expects Singapore to remain among Indian tourists’ top destinations in 2025 as the two countries mark 60 years of bilateral cultural relations.And Indian tourists are gaining a reputation for being big shoppers.In 2024, until June, Indian travellers in Singapore spent $776.5 million, out of which 28 per cent was spent on shopping, followed by 19 per cent on accommodation and 15 per cent on food and beverage. The year before – from January to December 2023 – Indians spent $1.53 billion, out of which 25 per cent was spent on shopping.“Studies also suggest that a rising number of Indians are shopping for luxury goods when travelling overseas, and Singapore is perfectly positioned to cater to this demand,” said Mr Tan.“Healthy competition drives us all to innovate and enhance our offerings, and it’s encouraging to see that Singapore remains a top choice for Indian travellers.”The Indian traveller is only too ready to travel overseas as foreign destinations, in some cases, become as affordable as domestic travel.Crisil’s recent study revealed that for a couple travelling for five days during the festive season and staying in five-star accommodation, it is cheaper to go to Bangkok in Thailand than to the southern Indian state of Goa, sought after for its beaches.“The reason being, for the same hotel chain, the tariffs in Goa are almost double those in Bangkok,” said Mr Sharma.“Price parity between domestic and international destinations is also making foreign travel more accessible to Indians.”In association with the Asia News Network \nTens of thousands of people gathered in central Belgrade on Sunday to protest against President Aleksandar Vucic and his ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), whom they blame for a railway station roof collapse last month that killed 15 people.The concrete awning of the recently renovated roof of Novi Sad station caved in on Nov. 1, killing 14 and injuring three. One of the injured died later.Opposition leaders and the public have taken to the streets repeatedly, blaming the accident on shoddy construction resulting from government corruption and nepotism.The ruling coalition denies those charges, and Vucic has said those responsible must be held to account.The protesters on Sunday evening switched on the lights of their mobile phones and stood in silence for 15 minutes to commemorate the victims.Some shouted \"Vucic, thief!\". Others held up banners reading \"You have blood on your hands\".\"We came here to say ‘Stop’ to everything that has been happening since 2012 [when Vucic’s party took power],\" said Aleksa, 30, an IT expert from Novi Sad.\"We want to see an end to corruption and nepotism.\"Students at state universities in Belgrade, Kragujevac and Nis have been protesting for weeks to demand the release of all documents relevant to the renovation of the station, as well as criminal prosecution of officials responsible for the disaster.Every day they block traffic in front of their faculties for 15 minutes to commemorate the 15 victims. \nA 31-year-old man died, and another sustained critical injuries in a motorcycle accident in Dang on Sunday night. The deceased has been identified as Dil Prasad Khatri of ward 2 of Paribartan Rural Municipality in Rolpa, according to Police Inspector Prakash Thapa, information officer of the Area Police Office, Tulsipur. The accident occurred when the motorcycle, heading towards Jaspur from Tulsipur, lost control and overturned in ward 12 of Tulsipur Sub-Metropolitan City. Khatri, who was riding pillion, succumbed to his injuries during treatment at Nepalgunj Medical College in Kohalpur on Sunday night. The motorcyclist, 31-year-old Pankaj Khatri of ward 11 of Tulsipur, sustained critical injuries and is undergoing treatment at the same medical facility, Thapa said.   \nPresident-elect Donald Trump threatened to reassert US control over the Panama Canal on Sunday, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates to use the Central American passage and drawing a sharp rebuke from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino.Speaking to a crowd of supporters in Arizona, Trump also said he would not let the canal fall into the “wrong hands,” warning of potential Chinese influence on the passage.After the event, he posted an image on Truth Social of an American flag flying over a narrow body of water, with the comment: “Welcome to the United States Canal!”“Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal?” Trump said at AmericaFest, an annual event organised by Turning Point, an allied conservative group. “Because we’re being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we’re being ripped off everywhere else.”Trump’s comments were an exceedingly rare example of a US leader saying he could push a sovereign country to hand over territory. They also underlined an expected shift in US diplomacy under Trump, who has not historically shied away from threatening allies and using bellicose rhetoric when dealing with counterparts.“It was given to Panama and the people of Panama, but it has provisions,” Trump said of the canal, which was once owned by the United States but was handed over to Panama decades ago.“If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, quickly and without question.”In a recorded message released by Panama’s President Mulino on Sunday afternoon, the nation’s leader said that Panama’s independence was non-negotiable and that China had no influence on the canal’s administration. He also defended the passage rates Panama charged, saying they were not set “on a whim”.China does not control or administer the canal, but a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings (0001.HK) has long managed two ports located on the canal’s Caribbean and Pacific entrances.The United States largely built the canal and administered territory surrounding the passage for decades. But the United States and Panama signed a pair of accords in 1977 that paved the way for the canal’s return to full Panamanian control. The United States handed over control of the passage in 1999 after a period of joint administration.“Every square meter of the Panama Canal and the surrounding area belongs to Panama and will continue belonging (to Panama),” Mulino said in his statement, which was released on X.Trump then responded to Mulino: “We’ll see about that!”The waterway, which allows up to 14,000 ships to cross per year, accounts for 2.5% of global seaborne trade and is critical to US imports of autos and commercial goods by container ships from Asia, and for US exports of commodities, including liquefied natural gas.It is not clear how Trump would seek to regain control over the canal, and he would have no recourse under international law if he decided to make a play for the passage.This is not the first time Trump has openly considered territorial expansion.In recent weeks, he has repeatedly mused about turning Canada into a US state, though it is unclear how serious he is about the matter. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump expressed interest in buying Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He was publicly rebuffed by Danish authorities before any conversations could take place.Trump repeated the idea on Sunday, in a statement announcing his pick for ambassador to Denmark, Ken Howery, a former ambassador to Sweden.“For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” he wrote on Truth Social. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that a moderate influence of westerly winds is currently observed across Nepal. The division said that a westerly low-pressure system is expected to impact Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces from this evening. At present, hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali provinces are experiencing partly cloudy conditions, while the weather remains mostly clear in other regions. Fog and mist are affecting parts of the Tarai and hilly areas. Light rainfall is expected in some areas of Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces. Additionally, light snowfall is likely in parts of the high hills and mountainous regions of Koshi province, and in several locations within the high-altitude areas of Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces. The division has cautioned about foggy conditions in parts of the Tarai and Kathmandu Valley in the morning, which could momentarily impact daily life, health, agriculture, transportation, and aviation. It has urged the public to exercise necessary precautions. \nThe Madheshi Commission has expressed serious concern over the display of racial and communal behaviour during the Nepal Premier League (NPL), recommending stringent action against the unruly groups involved. Citing that disruptive groups reportedly engaged in discriminatory conduct against Janakpur Bolts’ supporters during the qualifier match between Janakpur Bolts and Karnali Yaks, the commission called for action against the people responsible for such behaviours.In its statement, the commission criticised state authorities for failing to act against the offenders, calling such inaction irresponsible. It also highlighted that while Nepal's constitution and laws advocate for equality and inclusion, discriminatory practices persist in society, hindering the nation’s progress.Meanwhile, the Chief Minister of Madhesh Province Satish Kumar Singh denounced the attack on Janakpur Bolts’ supporters as “unbearable and distressing.” He said that sports foster unity and harmony, but incidents of physical assault during the NPL final match had marred the spirit of the competition. Singh urged the authorities to act promptly and ensure those responsible face legal consequences.Moreover, the CK Raut-led Janamat Party expressed grave concern over the racial abuse and assault targeted at Madheshi community supporters of Janakpur Bolts after the final match. The party called on the government to identify and penalise the individuals involved in the incident.Similarly, Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa condemned the racial and communal behaviour, calling it deeply troubling. “Such actions cannot be justified under any circumstances,” Thapa said, demanding immediate action against the offenders. “No ifs, no buts.” \nThe Kaski District Police has officially requested Speaker Devraj Ghimire to suspend Rastriya Swatantra Party chair and Member of Parliament Rabi Lamichhane from his parliamentary position. The move follows the filing of a chargesheet against Lamichhane under the Money Laundering Prevention Act 2008 in the Kaski District Court.The charges stem from Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the Suryadarshan Cooperative fraud case. Alongside Lamichhane, 30 others, including former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, have been accused of cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering.According to Clause 27 of the Money Laundering Prevention Act, Lamichhane is subject to automatic suspension once charges are filed. This clause mandates that officials facing such charges remain suspended until the case is resolved. Speaker Ghimire is expected to make the suspension official by posting a notice on the parliamentary bulletin board, as the House session is not currently in progress.The Kaski District Court chargesheet reveals that Lamichhane and his associates allegedly embezzled over Rs2.7 billion. The charges include cooperative fraud (with penalties of 4–6 years imprisonment), organised crime (an additional 50 percent punishment), and money laundering (2–15 years imprisonment and fines double the embezzled amount).The chargesheet also implicates eight companies and several cooperatives, including Suryadarshan Cooperative, for diverting funds to ventures like Gorkha Media Network, which owned the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television. Lamichhane was reportedly a partner in the network before resigning in June 2022 to enter politics.The Kaski District Attorney’s Office has been intensifying its investigation into cooperatives fraud. A supplementary chargesheet filed earlier targeted other cooperatives and individuals, further implicating Lamichhane and his network in widespread financial irregularities.Lamichhane, who represents Chitwan’s constituency-2 in Parliament and leads the RSP parliamentary party, now faces legal and political challenges as investigations proceed. \nNepal and China signed a framework for Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation, paving the way for project negotiations with \"aid financing\" modalities including grants and low-interest loans.\nNepali officials were paid $2.5 million in bribes to seal the contract for the $209.6-million Airbus deal, the largest in Nepal’s aviation history, charging documents filed in the US court show.Deepak Sharma, a former executive of the US-based aviation services provider AAR, pleaded guilty in July earlier this year to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) anti-bribery provisions. The charges were based on allegations that Sharma was part of a conspiracy to bribe Nepali officials to secure two Airbus A330 deals in 2017.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1. \nNepal's low-growth, high-migration trap, driven by political kleptocracy and cronyism, has deepened despite emerging political agency and a growing structural crisis, creating a potential for rupture if comprehensive political and economic reforms are not implemented.\nNepal Premier League Twenty20 cricket tournament, featuring international stars and significant sponsorship, aims to propel Nepali cricket to new heights, offering a financial lifeline for domestic players and a global stage for showcasing local talent.\n[Crucial events summarized in a single line, preserving key information]\n**Concise Event Summary:** Crucial occurrences unfolded, including conflicts, diplomatic negotiations, and societal transformations.\n\nAmid the 2015 constitution promulgation and blockade, Rae, as envoy to Kathmandu, discusses Nepal-India relations, regional geopolitics, and perceptions between the countries.\nWhen I visited ‘The Mini Prints Art Fair’, hosted by Siddhartha Art Gallery, I observed a vibrant celebration of contemporary Nepali art showcasing talented artists. The exhibition features 200 intricate mini-prints using etching, woodcut, and embossing techniques.The fair offers diverse artistic interpretations with works ranging from creations such as ‘Unstable II’ by Sujita Maharjan to cultural depictions like ‘Ganapati Bappa’ by Seema Sharma Shah. Delicately crafted pieces encapsulate themes of tradition, identity, and imagination. This fair not only highlights the technical expertise of Nepali artists but also the evolving narrative of contemporary art in the region. Rustom Mody, country director of the British Council Nepal, inaugurated the event, emphasising the fair’s cultural significance. Visitors will have an immersive experience of vibrant stories told through a small-scale yet impactful medium.The exhibition, organised by Printmaking Nepal, highlights the organisation’s dedication to nurturing the art of printmaking among the younger generation. Focusing on education and creativity, the studio conducts workshops to equip aspiring artists with the skills and confidence to pursue their passions. Over the years, they have collaborated with 100 artists, blending the talents of emerging graduates and seasoned professionals. Their primary aim is to foster collaboration between new and established artists, creating a learning environment based on mentorship and experience-sharing.Uma Shankar Shah, one of the founding members of Printmaking Nepal, wants to make print art more accessible by highlighting its affordability. With prices starting from Rs3,000, Shah hopes audiences will embrace Printmaking Nepal’s message: “Art can be affordable and accessible, allowing common people to own and enjoy it without spending a fortune.”He discussed his artwork titled ‘Ramayan’, inspired by his roots in Janakpur. Having previously worked on series like ‘Roti-Beti’, he continues exploring the Maithili storytelling style, which he notes is rarely represented in art. Shah incorporates iconic imagery in his print art ‘Ramayan’, such as the main gate doors, the bow, and Sita Swayamvar. Visitors will notice a deliberate contrast in the artwork’s use of colour, with one piece being colourful and another monochrome. This distinction is achieved using natural elements, including soil, to bring depth and authenticity to the pieces. He says, “Artists face several challenges in pursuing their craft, with the lack of studio space being a primary concern. Thankfully, there are now at least ten studios in Kathmandu where they can work. Another major difficulty is sourcing materials, such as zinc plates and 20x40-inch paper, which are essential for their work. The process is also physically demanding, using acid for etching and handling heavy stones weighing 15-20 kilograms. These stones must be moved repeatedly across tables, requiring careful precision to avoid accidents, which could result in significant setbacks.”As he walked me through the exhibition, it was evident that it did not follow a central theme. He explained, “All the artists centred their work around a basic question: what can society gain from this? In this exhibition, we focus on the post-postmodernism of the 21st century—not rejecting tradition like postmodernism but delving deeper into cultural roots. As we observe in contemporary society, individuals are increasingly drawn to ancient works, whether through traditional designs in clothing or music. Our focus is on representing societal traditions in a new way.”When asked what message he had for emerging artists, he said, “As both an artist and organiser, my advice to them is that there are studios and opportunities available to showcase the work you create right after graduation. So, don’t give up on pursuing this field. Take inspiration from artists like David Basnet, who, despite being in the middle of his master’s degree, already has his artwork featured in this exhibition. Opportunities like these prove that talent and dedication can open doors, even early in your career.”Sujita Maharjan’s series of prints greets visitors, exploring themes of architectural evolution. One of her works critiques the tension between the instability of modern building designs and the rising costs of preserving traditional aesthetics. Another striking piece features a boat with a building. Her print art also incorporates intricate patterns that draw connections to Buddhism, adding a spiritual dimension to her exploration of architecture and culture.Another artist, Lokchitra, one of Nepal’s well-known traditional ‘paubha’ or ‘thangka’ artists, brings his expertise into printmaking with his work ‘Panchabuddha’. He explained, “This work reflects self-realisation, illustrating the five elements present in our bodies: air, water, fire, earth, and aether. ‘Panchabuddha’ essentially represents us, not external forms of Buddha.” In another piece titled ‘Atala’—meaning ‘unmovable’—he depicts a falchion with two blades, symbolising cutting through ignorance by understanding relative and ultimate truths. His art beautifully merges traditional symbolism with contemporary printmaking techniques.Similarly, David Basnet’s contributions include the print ‘Blooms of Thanksgiving’, inspired by the Christmas season, his gardener father, and his love for plants. The blooming cactus featured in his artwork reflects these personal connections. He explained, “Another piece, ‘Through the Bamboos’, was inspired by Nepal’s recent floods. After learning that bamboo helps prevent soil erosion, I created this artwork to highlight its environmental significance.”Basnet’s third work, ‘Old Cycle’, evokes nostalgia for his childhood memories of cycling in Kathmandu. Another of his prints depicts clock hands obstructed by vines but surrounded by blooming flowers. “Even during moments of obstruction, beauty can still emerge,” Basnet shared.Umesh Shah, primarily a painter, shared that he found printmaking interesting through the workshop. His work mainly incorporates Mithila elements inspired by Bastar Art and folk art. His piece ‘Plantation’ reflects his experience living in the Tarai region, contrasting past greenery with current deforestation. Through this, Shah urges for reforestation and better land utilisation. Another of his prints portrays the dedication and hard work of labourers, despite their insufficient wages, using tribal imagery to emphasise their resilience and struggle.Each artist brings a unique perspective, blending personal stories, cultural heritage, and social commentary._____The Mini Prints Art FairWhen: Until January 15Where: Siddhartha Art Gallery, Babermahal RevisitedTime: Sunday to Friday: 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, Saturday: 12 noon to 5 pmEntry: Free \n‘But Still, We Rise,’ performed by differently abled and LGBTQIA+ performers, highlighting marginalized women's struggles and triumphs, will be restaged with sign language interpretation and free tickets for disabled individuals.\nAs a kid, I was drawn to horror movies. Even though they were frightening, I couldn’t resist the thrill they provided. As I entered my teens, I slowly moved away from movies and began reading. I naturally gravitated toward psychological thrillers, especially those by Indian author Navoneel Chakraborty. Chakraborty’s Stranger Trilogy introduced me to this genre, and at just thirteen, I found it so terrifying that it robbed me of sleep—it felt as intense as watching horror movies.Now, in my early 20s, I still seek that same adrenaline rush. My recent read, ‘His Afflicted Mind’ by Prabigyan Aryal, was the ideal book to appease my craving. It left me wondering what would happen next, and in my search for answers, I couldn’t stop reading. The book was a mix of thrill and fear, keeping me hooked until the last page.Aryal has delved into layered childhood trauma, mental illness, and depression, dissecting these themes. How does the mind of a mentally ill individual function? How can childhood trauma affect an individual’s psyche? These are some of the questions explored in this novel. The novel’s first page contains a trigger warning. Reading it, I prepared for what lies ahead. The story starts when one of the protagonists, Aria, talks to her therapist, Dedric. Shaking uncontrollably and feeling nervous, Aria struggles to share things with her therapist. Dedric tries his best to comfort her to share, as reflected in this line: “Don’t be nervous. I am here to listen. I will respect what you have to say. Take as much time as you want.” Finding comfort in his words, Aria talks about her past. The book then continues in retrospect from December 2, 2017. This narrative technique piqued my curiosity. In the present, Aria struggles to speak to the therapist, and the author's choice of words to articulate her feelings left me wondering how she reached this place mentally.On December 2, 2017, in the fictional town of Ashvale—depicted as bleak and frigid under the grip of a harsh winter—Aria recounts her meeting with Arlo, her cherished childhood friend. She yearns for him, aching to return to their carefree days at age eleven when worries unburdened life. Through her recollection, it becomes clear that Arlo, too, struggled mentally, masking his pain behind a smile. Aria longs to be the one to make him smile, to soothe and love him. However, her yearning never materialises, plunging her into a profound sadness. Her sorrow is so overwhelming that she stands out as the saddest character I have ever read about.As readers turn a few more pages, they uncover not only the depths of Aria’s sorrow but also the severity of her deteriorating mental health. Aria hears sounds that aren’t real and sees things invisible to others. One day, after hearing strange noises, she peers outside her window and surveys the scene. Despite the thick fog, she spots a man dressed entirely in black, smiling at her. The moment she blinks, he vanishes. At first, readers might dismiss this as a fragment of her imagination. However, it becomes evident that it’s something deeper—schizophrenia, which manifests in such vivid hallucinations.Aria’s hallucinations go beyond the man in black; she also repeatedly sees a little girl outside her window—the haunting image of her dead daughter, whom she had burned alive when the child was just five years old. Her fractured mind weaves intricate delusions, using the letters ‘no’ and ‘ah’ from her parents’ names, Norbert and Hannah, to conjure an imaginary brother named Noah. Aria recounts a vivid memory of watching Noah murder her parents right before her eyes when she was a child.However, as the story unfolds, readers discover it was Aria herself who slit her parents’ throats. Her mind, unable to cope with the trauma, deceived her into believing false memories. This twist reveals that Aria suffers not only from schizophrenia but also from confabulation. In this condition, imagined scenarios are confused with real memories, leaving her unable to distinguish between the two.Hence, the book plunges readers into a shadowy, unsettling world of suspense and unease. As I read, I felt an eerie sensation. The author’s ability to evoke such emotions is commendable.What makes ‘His Afflicted Mind' especially engaging is its unpredictable nature. The narrative is slow-paced, deliberately, as it doesn’t reveal everything. Instead, the story keeps you guessing, feeding your curiosity piece by piece. Mysterious events unfold one after another, and just when you think you’ve figured things out, another twist takes you by surprise. This constant anticipation kept me glued to the book, unable to put it down. Additionally, Aryal captures the inner workings of a mentally ill mind with a raw, unfiltered authenticity. Tackling significant subjects like mental illness and childhood trauma while battling depression must have been a difficult task for Aryal. In the author’s note, he writes, “I wrote this book as a way of dealing with depression in my own life and in the hopes of getting more people to understand about what goes on in the mind of someone who is psychologically ill.” In addition, the writing style in ‘His Afflicted Mind’ is characterised by its simplicity, making it accessible to a broad audience. However, readers should be prepared to encounter a few grammatical errors throughout the book. For example, on page 105, the sentence reads, “She is more precious that life itself,” and on page 212, “I cannot to do this.” These errors disrupted the flow of the story and detracted from the emotional impact the book was striving to convey. It’s unfortunate, as more attention from the author and editor could have ensured a more polished reading experience. _____His Afflicted MindAuthor: Prabigyan Aryal Publisher: Daami Year: 2019Pages: 218 \nWith a year to go before its 15th general convention, the race for the prize of the Nepali Congress president is starting to heat up. Senior party leader Shekhar Koirala has ‘unofficially’ kicked off his campaign to win the party’s coveted post from Sudurpaschim Province, traditionally a stronghold of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba. Starting the campaign in Deuba’s heartland and getting strong support of party leaders and cadres in the region means he wants to win Deuba's support too, said a Congress leader of the Koirala camp.Koriala, who lost the party president election to Deuba at the 14th general convention in December 2021, is contesting again. The two-term limit imposed by the party charter for the top post prevents Deuba from running again. The incumbent president has so far not disclosed who he will support as his successor. Another potential candidate is General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa, who has not officially declared his candidacy but has already activated his network and mechanism to win the support of party workers across the country.Koirala on Friday interacted with party leaders and cadres of nine districts in the Sudurpaschim Province and sought their support for his bid. He and other central members interacted for six hours with local party leaders in Dhangadhi and solicited their views, Govind Raj Pokahrel, who was with Koirala, told the Post. “We had excellent interactions, following rousing welcome from the party leaders and cadres alike in Dhangadhi,” Pokharel said.“You can call it an ‘unofficial’ launch of the campaign but the focus is also on putting pressure on the party leadership to hold the 15th general convention on time,” said Pokharel. “That is the central thrust of the meetings and interactions.”But the prospect of convening the 15th general convention in December 2025 is slim as the party encounters new complications in the distribution of active membership. Only active members can elect party leaders from the ward level. Those elected ward members later vote for the party’s representatives from all 165 electoral constituencies, who in turn vote for the new party leadership. “In order to complete the local conventions on time, we sent active membership application forms to the 165 constituencies as well as party chapters abroad but no constituency has completed its task,” a Congress office bearer said. “This could push back the general convention.” The Congress has formed a task force to look into issues related to the general convention. The general convention is likely to be deferred by a year due to a number of political and technical issues, said Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada. As per the Congress charter, the party can defer the general convention by a year citing unavoidable circumstances.According to party leaders, there is a big churn happening inside the Congress, with old factions and groups either dismantled or taking new shapes in light of the upcoming general convention. For instance, former foreign minister NP Saud, a longtime aide to Deuba, joined the Koirala faction.More leaders of the Deuba camp have also joined Koirala or Thapa factions. With Deuba out of the race, there is now a competition between Koirala and Thapa to pull leaders from the Deuba camp into their folds, said a Congress central committee member.Though Deuba has kept his cards close to his chest, many Congress leaders believe General Secretary Thapa is now making inroads into the Deuba camp. The two have been getting closer after CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli became the prime minister in July. “Deuba has so far refrained from fully supporting Thapa, Koirala or any other candidate,” said Khatiwada, chair of the federal parliament’s State Affairs Committee. There is also a chance of Deuba rooting for Dr Shashanka Koirala as next party president.“I will build a Nepali Congress suitable to the times we live in after the 15th general convention,” Shekhar Koirala said in Dhangadhi on Saturday. “In order to strengthen the party, I am ready to take over its leadership.” Koirala said the focus is on holding the general convention by December 2025 as stipulated in the charter, and there should be “no ifs and buts about this”. Soon after he lost the party presidency in 2021, Koirala started campaigning for the next convention, travelling across the country, meeting party cadres and most often playing the role of the party’s “opposition” leader. Congress central working committee member Ajaya Babu Shiwakoti, who is close to Gagan Thapa, said Thapa is busy handling the mechanism formed by the ruling Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to make the government’s work effective, as well as with the party’s internal works, “which is why he appears slow in preparing for the next convention”. “But he [Thapa] is constantly in touch with party leaders and cadres across the country,” said Shiwakoti. “Also, there have been no serious talks between Koirala and Thapa on who will contest the post of party president.” Thapa contested and won the general secretary position from the Koirala camp at the last convention. While Koirala lost the top post, Thapa won with a wide margin of votes.There is a section of leaders in the Koirala-Thapa camp who still believe the two leaders should come together and contest the elections in consensus so that the camp can win a maximum number of seats in the Congress central working committee and other bodies of the party. \nThe Supreme Court has shattered yet another attempt by the CPN (Maoist Centre) to institutionalise its “people’s war”.A year after “scrapping” the decision of the erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government to announce a public holiday to mark the launch of the Maoists’ decade-long “people’s war’ in 1996, the top court has issued an order not to use ‘janayuddha’ in government documents.Issuing an interim order in a writ petition filed by Advocate Gyanendra Aran, the Constitutional Bench has directed the federal and Madhesh provincial governments not to use it until the final verdict. Aran, who also is a victim of the Maoist insurgency, had challenged the government's decision to include the term in official documents, saying it had glorified the killings and violence.The text of the ruling from last week was made public on Thursday.The national budget presented by Barshaman Pun, finance minister in the erstwhile Dahal government, on May 28 for the current fiscal year mentions “people’s war”. Similarly, the Madhesh Province’s fiscal budget for 2024-25 also mentions the term. The court says that the use of “people’s war” is against the spirit of the preamble of the Constitution of Nepal and its Article 42 (5). Instead of “people’s war”, the Article uses ‘armed conflict’ to refer to the Maoist insurgency. A five-member bench led by Chief Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut also cited how the Constitutional Committee of the Constituent Assembly on January 3, 2010, had rejected the terminology proposal.During eight years of constitution drafting, the Maoist Centre invested all its effort to put the term into the constitution. However, the former insurgents were unsuccessful as the rest of the parties stood against it. It took several sittings and days for the parties to agree that the issues which cannot be decided with consensus would be put to a vote.The “people's war” was one such contentious issue that was put to vote but was rejected by the majority. ‘Armed conflict’ has been in official use to indicate the 1996-2006 insurgency. The Maoist Centre leadership has spoken against the top court’s ruling saying that banning the term is against the democratic spirit.“I heard you [people’s war] are banned; perhaps they want to lock you in a cold cellar knowing that you are a spokesperson for social justice,” Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre’s deputy general secretary, wrote on Facebook. “A ban is a mockery of democracy. The people’s war—you have been banned.”Now the same constitutional bench will conduct final hearing on the case before passing a verdict. This is the second time in a year the top court shot down the attempt of the third largest party to institutionalise “people's war”.On December 28 last year, the Supreme Court annulled the government’s decision to declare Falgun 1 a public holiday as the ‘People's War Day’.A division bench of justices Anand Mohan Bhattarai and Mahesh Sharma Paudel had quashed the government’s decision on a public holiday while responding to a writ petition by various individuals, including Advocate Aran.The government in February 2023 had announced a public holiday to commemorate the ‘People’s War Day’ despite reservations from a coalition partner. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party then refused to attend the Cabinet meeting, expressing displeasure with the decision.The rebellion that started on February 13, 1996, concluded following a Comprehensive Peace Agreement on November 21, 2006.The Maoists, who led the insurgency, observe the first day of the Nepali month of Falgun as the People’s War Day every year. However, other political forces see the marking of the day as a public holiday as a glorification of the conflict—and hence unacceptable. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has announced that it will start random on-the-spot emission testing of vehicles on the road beginning next week.The move of the city office comes amid deteriorating air quality in Kathmandu Valley.“We have provided necessary training to two mechanical engineers, who will be deployed for emission testing,” said Jagatman Shrestha, traffic expert adviser at the metropolis. “We have also coordinated with the environment department of the federal government, traffic police, and the department of transport management to start these tests.”The city office has purchased two smoke meters (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions)—one for diesel vehicles and the other for petrol vehicles—to carry out emission testing. Officials say, for the first time, motorcycles and scooters will also be tested.Though vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of federal government agencies, the constitution also mandates local governments to take measures to reduce pollution, officials say.The metropolis has developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.Officials say these random tests will be conducted on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the department of transport management and received green stickers, as all four-wheelers on the road typically do. However, some may still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing. “We will not issue green stickers to vehicles but check emission levels,” said Shrestha. “If we find vehicles emitting pollutants more than permissible levels, we will slap a fine.”According to the officials, Rs1,000 will be fined for polluting vehicles for the first time.Random vehicle testing is among the measures the city office is taking to tackle air pollution.The municipal environment department has also started monitoring the city’s air quality independently. For that, the city office has installed portable devices in various locations. “We have already installed portable air quality monitoring devices in 16 locations within the metropolis and are preparing to install three more,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the department. “We have also launched a drive to make people aware of air pollution.”Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis.According to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air quality data from around the world, Kathmandu’s PM2.5 levels reached 197 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) on Friday afternoon.PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and get into the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.As per the Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index, when air quality reaches 151-200, it is considered unhealthy; everyone may experience problems, with sensitive groups feeling more severe effects.Major hospitals report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Meanwhile, the city office said it had installed push-button traffic lights in 36 locations for the ease of pedestrians. “We are working to bring those devices into operation soon,” said Shrestha, traffic adviser of the metropolis. “Pedestrians can push the button to stop traffic and cross the road safely.”Push-button devices are installed at traffic intersections to allow pedestrians to request stop road traffic, so that they can cross the road without fear. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nMina Karki from Dekuldanda in Ribdikot rural municipality, Palpa, has been engaged in beekeeping for 30 years. But recently, with the rising use of pesticides in commercial farming, she has been facing the problem. Bees are dying or fleeing.Most farmers are worried because honeybees are crucial to the food supply, pollinating over 100 crops. Reports say that three-fourths of the world's flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world's food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. Karki, who has been doing beekeeping with the support of her husband, has more than 25 hives. She earns Rs60,000 annually and is motivated to earn while staying at home.“But dying bees have troubled many people like me,” said Karki. “I’ve been in the beekeeping business for three decades. This problem was rare.”Hom Bahadur Bhattarai of Bhairavsthan of Ribdikot has at least 35 hives. He has seen bees flying away. The hives have shrunk due to deaths as well.The Bhattarai couple said the problem became severe in the past couple of years. After generating a good income, Bhattarai added hives. He extracts honey three times a year. He assumed that the haphazard use of pesticides in vegetable and chilli farming has started impacting beekeeping.Nara Bahadur Palli of Jhadewa in Mathagadhi rural municipality has bee hives, around 90, on his terrace.He has been keeping traditional wooden hives for seven decades. Palli’s source of income is honey produced in the hives. But he is facing the same problems as Karki and Bhattarai.“Nobody has taken an initiative to solve the problem,” said Palli.Small investments, less hard work, and good benefits made beekeeping lucrative for many villagers. What threatens the occupation’s sustainability is that beekeepers do not receive technical and promotional support from the government. “Who will help us?” questions Palli. “I have been doing it on my own. I go to Tarai to sell the honey, and I am fine with that.”The subsidies provided by the government are gobbled up by those who are clever and have direct access to it, said Palli.Customers now reach farmers’ homes to buy honey, so there is no problem with sales. However, problems with beekeeping have only compounded.“I used to make at least Rs150,000 from honey a year. But, recently, there are no bees in half the hives,” said Palli. “Bees are disappearing. Most hives are empty. Even others have fewer bees.”Farmers are unable to stop bees from dying or fleeing. Though they have tried to retain the bees, nothing seems to be working.Farmers say long dry spells of winter, lack of bee pasture and excessive rainfall were also the reasons behind the declining bee populations.Marmara in Palpa is a good bee pasture area. Agriculture technicians said honey can be extracted three to five times in this area.Palli said that though he could save bees from other wild insects and pests, he failed to save them from dying due to the excessive use of harmful chemicals.Santosh Kumar Chaudhary, an agri expert and acting chief of the Agriculture Knowledge Centre, said that due to the impact of climate change, pests have been increasing, and farmers are applying more pesticides. “Recently, village farmers have started using pesticides on vegetables, fruits, and round chillis. But no one is aware of its direct and indirect impact.”Haphazard use of pesticides has not only made people suffer from diseases but also hugely impacted bees, Chaudhary said.The Agriculture Knowledge Center has removed subsidies for beekeepers.With the failure of the Smart Krishi Programme operated in Marmara of Jhadewa, Mathagadhi rural municipality by the Lumbini province, the government has allocated funds only for general training.Chaudhary said beekeepers had not been informed about the problem.However, according to the Agriculture Knowledge Centre, farmers’ use of pesticides for commercial farming might have impacted bees.With or without government support, farmers are earning well from beekeeping and are commercialising beekeeping at low costs.The government data shows there are more than 20,000 bee hives in Palpa. If the processing, packaging, and market management can be done with less pesticide use, farmers can be more commercial and earn more, said an agri expert. \nIn Majhthana, a remote hill station in Kaski district, Chandra Kanta Ghimire, a returnee migrant, wakes up early to cook khole (a soup of maize flour and vegetables) to feed his buffaloes. He has minimal green fodder, so he supplements their diet with a mixture of dry straw.Ghimire owns 10 Murrah buffalos. These water buffaloes originate in Haryana and Punjab, India and are mainly known for producing a high volume of milk. Until recently, he had no idea about the buffalo meat export prospects.Eleven months ago, he took another Rs2.3 million loan and added more buffaloes. “I spent Rs600,000 to erect a shed and have decided to add two buffaloes this year.”Ghimire said that a Murrah buffalo costs around Rs170,000. “I milk 50 litres a day, making a monthly income of Rs147,000 by selling it at Rs115 per litre,” said Ghimire, who dreams of buying a car with the income in four or five years. The 51-year-old farmer recently bought a washing machine. Ghimire said he hasn’t considered rearing buffalo for meat. “But I have heard it’s rewarding,” Ghimire told the Post last month. Commercial buffalo rearing for meat purposes is limited in Nepal, and the export of buffalo meat is negligible. This week, on Monday, Beijing opened a trade prospect for the meat industry, apart from traditional handicraft products, which Nepal has been exporting to its northern neighbour for decades.During Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s recent visit to China on December 2, Beijing surprised Nepal by opening its doors to water buffalo meat. On social media platforms, many users pointed out that during then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s trip to New Delhi in May, his counterpart gifted 15 Murrah buffaloes to Nepal, while Prime Minister Oli travelled to China and agreed to sell buffalo meat. But for Nepal’s ailing agricultural sector, this Chinese initiative represents a huge prospect and may significantly help the country’s graduation from least developed country (LDC). As per the statistics, if the buffalo meat export materialises, it could surpass the total export earnings from the 32 high-value goods identified by Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS), which totalled Rs110.38 billion in the last fiscal year. The trade strategy was revised last fiscal year to support Nepal’s graduation from the LDC status to a developing country by 2026.On December 16, Himalayan Food International, a private company in Nepal, and Shanghai Ziyan Food, a company in China, inked a business-to-business agreement in Kathmandu to export buffalo meat.“Immediately after the successful visit of Rt Hon PM and agreement on Buffalo meat export to China. The game-changing MOU of Strategic Cooperation for Nepal Thermally Processed Buffalo Meat Products Export Project to China is inked today, which has opened over 100 billion rupees in the buffalo farming industry in Nepal, benefitting tens of thousands of rural families. Congratulations to both our people,” Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song wrote on X.Beijing is employing soft trade diplomacy to buy $1.5 billion worth of buffalo meat from Nepal in a year, terming the project a game-changer.Experts say that’s a big opportunity for Nepal, whose annual export to China is Rs2.58 billion. The meat Beijing has sought from Nepal accounts for almost 66 percent of Nepal’s annual imports from China, which total $2.21 billion.But challenges galore.“China may offer technical help to build a processing facility for this purpose,” said Mahanand Joshi, a senior agri-economist at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. “A Nepali private company will export $1.5 billion of buffalo meat annually, depending on Nepal’s production. The government will invest to increase buffalo production accordingly.” “To meet the target of $1.5 billion, we need to meet the technical standard for export, and work will be expedited for this purpose.”However, Nepal’s present buffalo population can’t even meet the high domestic market demands, and insiders say buffalos are brought in large numbers from India.The buffalo meat industry of Nepal is still experiencing a market gap due to the demand-supply mismatch. The Beijing initiative opens new opportunities for entrepreneurs to fill the gap.The total meat production in Nepal peaked at 552,156 tonnes in 2019-20 due to the Covid pandemic, when people started to take an extra protein diet to fight the virus.However, production gradually dropped to 520,742 tonnes in 2020-21 and 512,788 tonnes in 2021-22. The production fell sharply to 430,085 tonnes in 2022-23, which experts attributed to an exodus of Nepali youth, the key population who loved eating meat. Government statistics show that labour permits and student visas were issued for nearly a million Nepalis in 2022-23. Buffalo meat, which represents 27 percent of total meat production in Nepal and has 20.23 grams of protein content per 100 grams, higher than other types of meat, rose to 189,517 tonnes in 2019-20. Production fell to 188,172 tonnes in 2020-21 and peaked at a time high of 194,090 tonnes in 2021-22. The output then shrank to a nearly two-and-a-half-decade low of 116,503 tonnes in 2022-23.The population of live buffalos, which was 3.70 million heads two decades ago, reached 5.30 million heads in 2018-19, the highest count. But since, the population has decreased, reaching a three-decade low of 3.08 million heads in 2022-23.Government officials see the Beijing initiative as a game changer for Nepal’s livestock sector.Sudhir Kumar Singh, information officer at the Department of Livestock Services, believes Nepal can meet the Chinese demand.“As demand for buffalo meat has declined, farmers too were discouraged. But if there is a trade prospect, commercial farming may thrive again.”Livestock traders say it is a day-dream. “Domestic production is not enough to meet domestic demand. We estimate that nearly 70 percent of buffaloes in Nepal are imported from India illegally to meet the buff demand,” said Jiban Khatiwada, president of the Nepal Livestock Traders Association. “In this scenario, immediately exporting buffalo meat in such a large amount is impossible.” Ghimire, the farmer in Kaski, says he didn’t import buffaloes from India. “A group of agents smuggle them. It’s not possible to bring Murrah buffalos from India legally.”Nepal has become self-reliant in goat and chicken production but not in buffalo.However, Navin Kumar Sharma, chairman of Himalayan Food International, is optimistic about the ambitious agreement. “But it will take some time.”“It is feasible to export $1.5 billion worth of buffalo meat to China by 2027-28 if we aggressively start rearing buffalo. We will start exporting 500 tonnes, as per our target. For this, we need to slaughter 5,000 buffaloes daily,” said Sharma.Chinese investors will put in Rs27 billion in two projects. Investment of Rs21 billion will be mobilised for buffalo rearing in three locations: Hariharpur Gadhi in Sindhuli, Ilam and Madi of Chitwan. Similarly, under the project, a Rs6 billion processing plant will be set up in Hariharpur Gadhi. Chinese investors are scheduled to inspect the factory in six months.“So, by the time they come, we must keep 40,000 buffalo calves. The Chinese investors have given us a target of rearing 200,000 buffalo heads in a year,” said Sharma. “We have to ensure that the buffalo meat originates in Nepal, but we will be exempted from the origin certificate for the first two years.”Sharma said he was exporting buffalo meat to Vietnam until the pre-Covid period, which then used to be re-exported to China. Buffalo is being produced primarily in Tarai areas. It takes two years for a calf to become mature for meat production.Khatiwada said people rear buffalo for milk, but as buffalo milk production is low, farmers focused on milk production have shifted to cow rearing. Also, it is comparatively easier to rear cows than buffaloes.Khatiwada said any increase in production depends on the government’s policy. “Once buffalo meat starts being exported to China, its price will rise domestically due to the push in demand. This might also encourage more farmers to start buffalo rearing,” he said.“But whatever the case, this project is undeniably ambitious.” \n\nThe cash-strapped Dairy Development Corporation has inked a pact to supply raw cheese to a private company, a move to generate cash as Nepal’s largest dairy company teeters on the edge of bankruptcy. The state-owned DDC will supply 1,000 kgs of raw cheese or whey made from 10,000 litres of milk daily to Himalayan Dog Chew, owned by Manaram Group, a key exporter of the hardened cheese.Whey is the liquid remaining after milk has been curdled and strained. It is used to make Chhurpi.The agreement was signed between Surya Prasad Paudel, general manager of the DDC, and Poonam Karki, chief financial officer of Manaram Group, on Wednesday. “We will supply whey for a year and renew the agreement next year,” said Paudel.Manaram Group has been exporting 100 tonnes of dog chew a month under the ‘Himalayan Dog Chew’ brand in the US market. The chew is produced in its plant in Godak, Ilam.Chhurpi, a traditional product of the highlands, is a protein-rich cheese with a smoky flavour and hard consistency that becomes chewier the longer one gnaws at it.This solid snack's uniquely challenging texture has been a favourite for decades for the people of eastern Nepal, eastern India, and Bhutan. Lately, American and Canadian pooches have grown a liking for the hard cheese made of milk, and traders can barely keep up with the demand.Paudel said the whey will be supplied from the milk collected in the DDC’s Biratnagar Milk Supply Scheme.“The consignment will begin from December 30.”DDC, the state-owned utility, has been struggling to pay dairy farmers for a long time as demand for milk has dropped sharply, which market insiders say was due to the price factor.The consumer price of processed milk, which was Rs76 per litre in January 2022, has reached Rs120 per litre, after a steep 58 percent rise over three years.Market analysts say that higher prices, compounded by the shrinking incomes of people, resulted in low demand for raw milk. Demand for other dairy items like butter also remains subdued.“The agreement with Manaram Group will boost our cash flow,” said Paudel. The DDC still has Rs580 million in dues to farmers even after taking a loan of Rs600 million from the government.As per Wednesday’s agreement, the DDC will sell whey or raw cheese at around Rs650 per litre. The DDC currently collects raw milk from farmers at Rs65 per litre. Paudel said there will be no milk holiday in eastern Nepal, at least now, due to the agreement.He said that supplying 10,000 litres of milk to a single company, however, will not create shortages in the market.According to the DDC, the Biratnagar Milk Supply Scheme collects 15,000 litres daily. “We will now have to increase the collection gradually to 25,000 litres,” said Paudel.DDC buys 120,000 million litres of milk from farmers nationwide, worth Rs7.9 million daily, or around Rs230 million monthly.Manaram Group, the renowned exporter of dog chew, has been collecting 6,000 litres of milk from nearby districts and producing dog chew at the Ilam plant. As the collection of milk is insufficient, the group buys dog chews from small dairy farmers in Dhankuta, Sankhuwasabha, Ilam, Panchthar and Taplejung districts.The demand for dog chew has been growing in overseas markets, particularly in the US, Canada and the UK, with more and more people there owning pets.The shipment of dog chew from Nepal increased 17.6 percent to Rs1.02 billion in the first four months of the current fiscal year until mid-November, compared to the same period last fiscal, according to the Trade and Export Promotion Centre.Of the Rs1.15 billion, Rs1.02 billion worth of dog chew was exported to the United States, Rs77.29 million to Canada and Rs19.57 million to the United Kingdom. The country exported dog chews worth Rs3.18 billion in the last fiscal year.Dog chew exports have shot up by more than 240 percent in the past six years, as 90 percent of what is produced in the country is sent abroad.DDC now has Rs580 million in outstanding payments to dairy farmers.As sales did not improve in summer, the key consumption period for dairy products, on September 27, the DDC requested a loan from the government to pay the farmers.Subsequently, the Public Debt Management Office issued a loan of Rs600 million. DDC expects the dues to be cleared by mid-July.The corporation has enforced quotas to buy milk from farmers in different parts of the country.The corporation introduced a quota system for buying milk from farmers in Dhangadhi and Nepalgunj under its Milk Supply Scheme project, as the collection cost has risen. The DDC has 500 tonnes of powdered milk and 600 tonnes of butter in stock. It plans to export butter to Tibet, China, and is doing necessary paperwork. \nNepal reported another monkeypox or mpox case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the deadly disease. “Yes, samples of the suspect, who has been admitted to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, have returned positive results,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire. “We collected the samples on Thursday and got a positive report today [Friday].”Health authorities confirmed the first case of monkeypox infection in June last year.A 60-year-old foreign national had then tested positive for the infection.Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries . Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.According to health officials, the infected person, who is a migrant worker, was sent to the Dhapasi-based Grande International Hospital soon after arrival.Doctors at the hospital suspected monkeypox infection, based on the symptoms, and referred the patient to Sukraraj Hospital.“He had rashes in his private parts and blisters on hands and legs,” said a doctor at the hospital, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “The patient admitted to have had sexual contact in Saudi Arabia.”Officials at the EDCD said they will start contact tracing from Saturday.“We have to trace close contacts of the patient on the plane he travelled and the vehicle he used to go to hospitals,” said Ghimire. Public health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Monkeypox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came into widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases. \nNepal’s health authorities are mulling postponing the malaria elimination target to 2030, aligning with the World Health Organisation’s target, after efforts to contain the spread of the disease proved ineffective and it became impossible to declare the country ‘malaria-free’ by the 2026 deadline.What alarmed them most was the isolated indigenous cases that have emerged as a major challenge to eliminating the disease from the country even by 2030.“Isolated indigenous cases of malaria have become a major challenge in containing the spread of the deadly disease,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Single indigenous cases of infection have been reported from several places. We have been struggling to trace the source of infection.”Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes carry these deadly parasites, according to the World Health Organisation. Nepal had initially committed to achieving ‘malaria-free’ status by 2026. For this, the country needs to bring down indigenous cases or local transmission to zero, achieve zero deaths starting from 2023, and maintain zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.However, the country has failed to bring down indigenous cases to zero in both 2023 and 2024.Instead, cases of infections–both Indigenous and imported have risen alarmingly, which shattered any prospects of eliminating the disease within the deadline.Health officials say that only 16 cases of local transmission or indigenous cases were confirmed in 2023. But in 2024, more than 20 cases have been reported. Compared to 649 imported cases in 2023, the country witnessed nearly 1,000 such cases in 2024.Indigenous malaria cases are locally transmitted, meaning the infected person does not have a history of travel to a malaria-affected country. Officials say that the isolated indigenous cases of malaria infection are such cases that they do not have a history of travelling to the disease-endemic areas.“Neither the people of the community and family have been infected, nor the infected persons have a history of travelling to disease-hit areas,” said Dahal. “We have stepped up surveillance measures to trace the source of infection.”Officials attribute that the disease might remain asymptomatic for a long time in the infected person and emerge as single isolated cases or may have been contracted within the country in areas not considered endemic.Officials further added that open borders, budget cuts in the health sector, and mosquitoes moving to higher altitudes due to climate change have hindered Nepal’s malaria elimination goal.They say that of the total imported cases, over 80 percent came from India. Some cases were imported from African countries. Nepali security personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-hit African countries also often get tested positive for malaria.Officials say the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in Nepal unless India eradicates it first. They say that due to proximity, and an open and porous border between Nepal and India and unregulated travel of people of both countries, it is impossible to eliminate malaria in Nepal, until the disease gets eradicated in the southern neighbour.Several other factors, including cuts in the health budgets by government and aid agencies and shifts in vectors transmitting malaria to the hills and mountains due to global warming, also pose serious challenges to meeting the elimination target. Apart from this, most health facilities across the country lack entomologists necessary for conducting surveillance. Malaria-related deaths had stopped since 2016, but five years later, in 2021, the country recorded one death from the disease.Officials at the health ministry said that until recent years, Plasmodium Vivax, a protozoan parasite, had been responsible for most of the malaria cases in the country, which caused relatively less severe diseases. However, cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which most often cause severe and life-threatening malaria, have been rising. The parasite is common in many countries in Africa and the Sahara desert. \nNepal received 460,940 doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on Tuesday evening, which will be used in the nationwide vaccination drive, scheduled to start on February 5, next year.The vaccine doses are part of over 1.7 million doses required for the first phase of the campaign, health officials say.“We received the first tranche of HPV vaccine doses,” said Om Prasad Upadhyay, an immunisation supervisor officer at the Department of Health Services. “Remaining doses will arrive before the start of the vaccination campaign.”Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact and is a major cause of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women as well. It is estimated that hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer in Nepal every year.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Experts say early treatment can prevent up to 80 percent of cervical cancer cases.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced HPV vaccines nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced them in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccines in Chitwan and Kaski districts. During the pilot, all girls aged between 11 and 13 years were given two doses of the vaccine.Last year, the country purchased 20,000 doses of the HPV vaccine and administered it to around 9,000 girls aged between 14 and 15 years in all seven provinces. Health authorities administered the vaccines at schools after other measures failed to increase the vaccine’s uptake.Doctors say most cases of cervical cancer are linked to HPV, and widespread immunisation could significantly reduce the impact of cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers worldwide.The Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to launch a nationwide HPV vaccination drive from February 5 next year.During the nationwide campaign, over 1.68 million girls between 10 and 14 years will be administered the HPV vaccine. Two doses of vaccine will be administered within a 12-month period. The Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has committed to supply the vaccine doses required for the campaign free of cost along with the campaign’s operation cost, officials say. The government has decided to include the HPV vaccine in the routine immunisation list following the compilation of the nationwide drive.It is estimated that there are around 350,000 girls aged 10 years who will be inoculated with the HPV vaccine.Nepal has to cover a certain percentage of the cost of the vaccine once it is included in the regular immunisation list, officials say.The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus. \nA few days ago, a five-year-old boy from Kathmandu was rushed to the emergency ward of the Kanti Children's Hospital for a respiratory illness. Doctors said the boy had been suffering from an acute lower tract infection, decreased lung function, and asthma.“Respiratory viruses, including influenza and others, become more active during the winter season,” said Dr Sumit Agrawal, the hospital spokesperson. “The rise in the air pollution levels has further exacerbated the problems.”This has become a common refrain among the hundreds of children suffering from respiratory illness, as the air quality in the country continues to decline.Doctors say respiratory viruses—influenza A(H1N1), A(H3), influenza B, rhinovirus, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses, among others—are generally more active during winter. But what alarmed them is that studies show children in Kathmandu Valley are highly exposed to air pollution, which could worsen respiratory and other problems.A recent study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council shows that children in Kathmandu Valley have been highly exposed to air pollution.“They are exposed to air pollution while commuting to and from school,” said Dr Megnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Council. “Those travelling by scooter to and from school are at risk even more.”According to the report, KN95 masks block 50 to 70 percent of pollution particles, but most children do not wear these masks. Parents, too, are often not aware of the risks. Moreover, children do not know how to wear face masks properly.With the start of the dry season, air quality, mostly in highly dense cities, including the Kathmandu Valley, has been worsening. IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air-quality data from around the world, has ranked Kathmandu among the world’s 10 most polluted cities several times in recent days. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and even the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and are also likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.Doctors say poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run, it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.“The increase in the sale of inhalers and nebulisers for children is also a clear sign of how serious the problem has become,” said Dr Ganesh Rai, former director at the Kanti Children Hospital. “The number of cases of respiratory illness in children has risen by 50 percent in the last 10 years and 100 percent in 20 years.”Studies show people in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by polluted air, which is responsible for more than 90 percent of deaths in these countries, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal also showed that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.Past studies also show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Public health measures—mask-wearing, handwashing, avoiding crowds, and maintaining social distancing—can reduce infection, according to doctors. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has imposed a fine of Rs200,000 on Bhatbhateni Supermarket in Tripureshwar for selling substandard products. The Department of Agriculture and Livestock, under KMC, found mold in packaged food items during an inspection prompted by customer complaints.Dr Awadhesh Jha, an inspection officer from the department, stated that the KMC call centre received complaints alleging the sale of “expired, rotten, and pest-infested food” at the store. Following the inspection, 44 packets of coconuts were found to contain mold, leading to their destruction on Friday and the subsequent fine imposed on the supermarket.In an official statement, KMC emphasised the importance of adhering to food safety regulations, saying, “The penalty amount must be deposited into the city’s revenue account. Moving forward, ensure that all items sold comply with Nepal’s laws and maintain high-quality standards fit for consumption.” \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nNepal played out a 1-1 draw against Bhutan in a Women’s U-19 international friendly held on Sunday at the Dasharath Stadium.Sushila KC opened the scoring for Nepal with a brilliant strike from outside the penalty area in the 47th minute. However, this goal did not prove decisive, as Bhutan’s Phuntsho Choden equalised in the 80th minute.The match also featured a crucial defensive effort by Nepal’s defender Simran Rai, who made a spectacular goal-line clearance with a header in the 20th minute, denying Bhutan’s Choki Om from scoring. Apart from this, both teams failed to create significant attacking opportunities in the first half.In their previous Women’s U-16 friendly, Bhutan had defeated Nepal 5-1. \n\nJanakpur Bolts’ Lahiru Milantha emerged as the leading run-scorer of the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) cricket season. His remarkable 87-run knock in the final against Sudurpaschim Royals propelled him to the top of the charts, surpassing Ravi Bopara, Rohit Paudel, and others.Before the final, Chitwan Rhinos’ Ravi Bopara led with 286 runs, followed by Lumbini Lions’ skipper Rohit Paudel with 279. Milantha, who had accumulated 206 runs before the final, surged ahead to 293 after his match-winning innings off 49 balls. He also maintained an impressive strike rate above 130 throughout the tournament.Milantha’s NPL campaign included a standout performance of 75 not out off 53 balls in the tournament opener against Biratnagar Kings.Meanwhile, Janakpur’s Lalit Rajbanshi and Sudurpaschim’s Scott Kuggeleijn tied as the season’s highest wicket-takers, both claiming 17 scalps. Rajbanshi’s disciplined bowling was pivotal in Janakpur’s victory. He bowled a maiden over early in the final and dismissed Sudurpaschim’s key batter, Binod Bhandari, for 41 runs. Rajbanshi ended the match with figures of 1 for 15 in 4 overs, including a maiden.In contrast, Kuggeleijn struggled in the final, conceding 28 runs in his first two overs. He managed to dismiss Milantha in the 17th over but gave away 15 runs in the same over, including wides and boundaries.Despite Kuggeleijn’s lower economy, his average of 12.35 in 9 matches edged Rajbanshi’s 12.52 in 10 matches. Other standout bowlers of the season included Chitwan’s Sohail Tanvir and Janakpur’s Kishore Mahato (14 wickets each) and Sudurpaschim’s Saif Zaib (12 wickets).Milantha and Rajbanshi’s contributions were instrumental in Janakpur Bolts’ successful NPL campaign, making them the standout players of the season. \nJanakpur Bolts clinched the Nepal Premier League (NPL) cricket title with a spectacular five-wicket win over Sudurpaschim Royals, thanks to Lahiru Milantha’s stunning batting performance. Milantha’s 87 off 49 balls led Janakpur to chase down a challenging 185-run target with four balls to spare at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Saturday.Janakpur got off to a flying start, adding 71 runs in the powerplay and 105 runs in the first 10 overs. Milantha, who completed his half-century in just 31 balls, was dropped on 65 when Sudurpaschim captain Dipendra Singh Airee missed a caught-and-bowled opportunity. Milantha’s innings included 9 fours and 4 sixes.Opener Aasif Sheikh contributed 33 runs off 19 balls, featuring 4 fours and 2 sixes, setting a solid foundation for Janakpur. Lower-order contributions from Harsh Thaker (30 off 24 balls) and Mayank Yadav (2 not out) sealed the victory. Sudurpaschim’s bowlers struggled, with Airee conceding 40 runs for a wicket in his 4 overs, while Saif Zaib, Ishan Pandey, and Scott Kuggeleijn took one wicket each.Earlier, Sudurpaschim posted 184 runs after electing to bat first. Opener Saif Zaib scored a brisk 69 off 43 balls, and Binod Bhandari added 41 off 31 balls, sharing a 117-run stand for the first wicket. Janakpur’s Kishore Mahato (3/25) and Mohammad Mohsin (3/40) led the bowling attack, restricting Sudurpaschim’s middle order.Janakpur’s triumph marked a comeback, as Sudurpaschim had defeated them twice earlier in the tournament. With this win, Janakpur Bolts emerged as the champions of the NPL, showcasing resilience and brilliant teamwork in the final. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Saturday accused Panama of charging excessive rates for use of the Panama Canal and said that if Panama did not manage the canal in an acceptable fashion, he would demand the US ally hand it over.In an evening post on Truth Social, Trump also warned he would not let the canal fall into the “wrong hands,” and he seemed to warn of potential Chinese influence on the passage, writing the canal should not be managed by China.The post was an exceedingly rare example of a US leader saying he could push a sovereign country to hand over territory. It also underlines an expected shift in US diplomacy under Trump, who has not historically shied away from threatening allies and using bellicose rhetoric when dealing with counterparts.The United States largely built the canal and administrated territory surrounding the passage for decades. But the US government fully handed control of the canal to Panama in 1999 after a period of joint administration.“The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, especially knowing the extraordinary generosity that has been bestowed to Panama by the US,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.“It was not given for the benefit of others, but merely as a token of cooperation with us and Panama. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question.” \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nPakistan is currently the world’s fifth most populous country. The majority of the population consists of youth between the ages of 18 to 30. The youth are our future, our most valuable assets; in their hands will soon lie the reins of the nation. However, we see that they are facing tremendous problems in finding a direction in life. They need guidance, help, and role models.It is the parents’ prime responsibility to guide their children on the way to success. It is necessary for parents to inculcate sound ethics in the younger generation so that they refrain from waywardness.Adolescence is a particularly important phase of life. It is a unique stage for laying the foundations for the future edifice of life. Adolescents experience rapid physical and cognitive growth. This affects how they feel, think, share, make decisions, and interact with the world around them.Though every young person is different from the other, and each builds his or her life according to their own individual experiences, they all share some basic traits. For example, they want to be attractive, energetic and passionate in their peer circle. They adopt new fashions and hairstyles, flaunt new clothes, and dream about achieving certain goals. With each passing day, they become more and more independent about the things they like, how to get around and where to go, how to spend time and how to spend money.The youth are required to understand the nature of life.As they become more independent, there come some changes in family routines and relationships, as well as their friendships. It is a period where they develop their own perceptions about the world. This creates a gap between parents’ thinking and that of their offspring. Many youths resort to throwing tantrums over trivial matters. In many cases, parents lose their influence over youths, but it is necessary that they keep an eye on their behaviour and try to reduce the gap between them.It is also a precarious stage where youths can be misled and adopt negative habits like smoking, or take to drug addiction. Therefore, they need special attention and constant encouragement to stay away from social evils.Normally, youths seem to be ambitious. Therefore, they should be encouraged to explore new opportunities and keep pace with the changing world. Parents may try to convince them that they should not rely on shortcuts for fame and success but work hard and embrace challenges so they may achieve success through struggle. In any field they choose, they should not simply chase grades but acquire real knowledge. Here, parents should try to instill in them a strong sense of commitment.Of late, the use of social media amongst the youth has increased manifold. Consequently, this has increased parents’ responsibilities significantly. There is a lot of fake content on various social media platforms. It is, therefore, the parents’ responsibility to protect the youth from the adverse effects of fake content. They have to balance screen time with physical activities to promote a healthy digital lifestyle. Monitoring should be coupled with open conversations and setting limits.The youth are required to understand the nature of life. Life is tough and competitive; it is not a bed of roses, nor is it full of thorns. It is full of ups and downs. It’s like an endless ocean. We are sailing in a boat and want to touch the shore. We must stay determined and try our best to reach our destination. If we quit making an effort, we will never get what we want and those who get what they want, will never stop trying for it.Islam places great emphasis on the role of youth in shaping a prosperous future, recognising their po­­tential for development and efficiency. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) in his wisdom, is said to have advised youngsters to make the most of their youth, health, wealth, free time, and life itself. According to a hadith, the Prophet said: “Take advantage of five before five: your youth before your old age, your health before your illness, your riches before your poverty, your free time before your work, and your life before your death.” This guidance aligns with modern scientific understanding, which acknowledges the vitality and innovation of young minds.The Holy Quran mentions the story of the People of the Cave (Ashab-i-kahf) — a group of devout youth who sought Allah’s help at the time of difficulties. They wanted to escape religious persecution; this is an example for all youths of how to surmount difficulties in life. The youth are facing major challenges today. They have to struggle and remain steadfast in their faith, for struggle itself is the meaning of life and there is no escape.Dawn (Pakistan) / ANN \nEarlier this week, Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chair KP Sharma Oli completed five months in office. His tango with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba seems to be proceeding well. Over the last few months, the top leaders of Nepal’s two major political parties have been excessively focused on not offending each other, as doing so could tip the balance.Since this new coalition was formed without a clear vision, it failed to inspire confidence from the outset. Hence, on the delivery front, the Oli administration was bound to fail.The CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress decided to join forces with the promise of amending the constitution to ensure political stability. Over the past months, the two parties have offered numerous reasons for forming the coalition, but none involve the constitutional amendment issue, as if it has vanished from their agenda.Neither party has provided answers about the amendment process, likely because they don’t have one.While an amendment to the constitution is not inherently problematic, there must be a clear rationale. The justification the two parties offered was so flimsy that it was evident from the start that their amendment rhetoric was just a ruse. Even if they are committed to their promise, it remains a misguided priority. The need of the hour is addressing more urgent matters, such as good governance and service delivery, which are directly linked to citizens.Misplaced priorityNepal’s major political parties—the NC, the UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—seem to have little confidence in the constitution they once championed through majoritarian dominance. Dissenting voices were ignored, suppressed and silenced.They once called it the world’s best but are now finding fault with it—not because it has caused problems for the people but because it obstructs their pursuit of majority governments. At least, this has been the argument of the UML and the Congress of late because they are the largest parties and are aiming for a majority in the next elections. Nevertheless, once promulgated, it was incumbent upon Nepali parties to focus on full implementation of the constitution. This required following due processes—enacting laws, devolving power and strengthening institutions. However, none of the parties paid attention to these fundamentals. Instead, they treated the constitution as a tool to “rule” when the charter required them to “govern.”Post-2015, Nepali parties had only two key responsibilities—governance and constitution implementation. They failed on both fronts, especially because they were excessively involved in the game of one-upmanship. These key duties were thus relegated to the back burner.Spirit of the constitutionA pluralist, inclusive, progressive and peaceful society was the core idea of the constitution. But this very spirit is under threat from the parties that are supposed to safeguard it, as they have failed to internalise the concept of constitutionalism in its true sense.Nepali politicians often cite the holding of two sets of national, provincial and local elections within the prescribed timeframe and the formation of governments to argue that democracy is functioning in Nepal. While this reasoning has merit, democracy’s full functionality depends on its realisation at the grassroots and among the people.True upholding of constitutionalism means abiding by its principles, respecting its limitations and adhering to the rule of law. Only then can the pluralistic, inclusive and progressive society envisioned by the constitution be built.Stable and accountable governance entails adherence to the rule of law, the protection of individual rights and the separation of powers.But questions remain: Have successive governments, regardless of which parties or leaders led them, fully complied with the laws? Has the system of checks and balances been allowed to operate fully in both letter and spirit?Constitutional moralityTrue implementation of the constitution depends on constitutionalism, which itself is rooted in constitutional morality—embracing not just legal provisions but also the underlying democratic values of justice, equality and respect for individual rights. Unfortunately, this idea—that the constitution is not just a guidebook setting the rules but a moral document—is sorely lacking among Nepali parties and politicians.The waning morality among Nepali parties has emerged as a troubling trend. Their pursuit of power and self-interest takes precedence over addressing citizens’ concerns. Since the UML and the Congress—historically rival parties—formed the new coalition, they have started floating the idea of a two-party system. While this notion is unlikely to materialise anytime soon, it does indicate their broader aim. Beneath the veneer of their argument for stability through a two-party system lies a dangerous intent to muzzle multi-party democracy, one of the basic tenets of the constitution, and to rule in turns.Coupled with this is yet another worrying concern: Internal democracy has been on the wane within Nepali political parties. Majoritarianism rules the roost in major parties, raising the risk that the same approach will manifest when they come to power. Democracy thrives when institutions are strong, but they have been weakened by the parties’ disregard for the separation of powers. Weak institutions, a lack of morality and an utter disregard for the rule of law create the perfect conditions for majoritarian tendencies to rear their ugly head.‘We, the People’The most worrying issue today is that political parties do not want to confront the most pressing issues of the day, which actually concern the people.While they harp on the constitution—and even warn that the statute is under threat—they ignore the fact that it will continue to face risks as long as they fail to ensure that the spirit of the charter resonates with ordinary people.The worry today is not just that Nepali parties are falling short on the delivery front; it is that the gains made so far could be in danger.The incumbent UML-Congress coalition, if genuinely committed to the welfare of ordinary citizens, must pause and reassess its priorities. Their survival and political relevance depend on embracing the politics of citizenry and addressing the pressing needs of the people they are meant to serve.Lest they forget, the ultimate power rests with “We, the People,” as the constitution declares. \nLong gone are the smog-free winter days. As soon as the temperatures dip, the bowl-shaped topography of Kathmandu Valley traps pollutants in the atmosphere, making its air one of the most toxic in the world. The problem is not limited to the federal capital and its periphery though, as other cities and districts in the country also fare poorly in this regard. All of Nepal’s 30.7 million people now live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline of 5 micrograms per cubic metre. This has cut the life expectancy of Nepalis by nearly five years, as reported by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) issued by the Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago.Though illegal, the practices of stubble burning in the fields, and open-waste or plastic burning in the backyards of houses, street corners and even public spaces, are widespread. Moreover, construction works on roads and sidewalks that linger for months or years result in much dust and dirt, while contractors often show little urgency to meet the deadlines. Little do people consider that their small part, when extrapolated across a large population, is making the air unbreathable and destroying their health. The systemic neglect of authorities is also exacerbating the air pollution crisis.Breathing in unhealthy air has multiple health consequences. Health workers warn that exposure to foul air can in the short term lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke and heart problems. Over time, it can cause severe conditions such as ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases and heart complications. Since the start of the dry season this year, hospitals in the Valley have witnessed a steady rise in the number of patients—mostly children and elderly—with respiratory illnesses. A recent Nepal Health Research Council study shows that children in Kathmandu Valley are particularly vulnerable to air pollution due to their exposure while commuting to and from schools. In response, the Ministry of Forests and Environment has recently asked people to focus on maintaining their vehicles, using clean energy, controlling smoke and dust coming from roads and construction work, and refraining from burning plastic. But such directives are more often ignored than they are heeded, by both the public and authorities. While sprinkling water on roads and sweeping the dust can keep our surroundings clean, these activities are no solutions to the problem of air pollution. Worryingly, promoting clean energy, including in our kitchens, doesn’t seem to be a priority of our political leaders and authorities. Experts also often point to lack of coordination between different agencies to tackle air pollution. We thus need a complete overhaul of the way we manage air pollution. Lasting solutions will emerge only through greater collaboration, for instance, between the local units, and the ministries of transport, health and population and urban development. Local authorities can control open burning through stringent rules and monitoring; the transport ministry too could get serious about phasing out old vehicles that emit pollutants. While pollution from cities in northern India has also been identified as a contributor to poor air quality in Nepali border towns and the capital city of Kathmandu, perhaps the locally generated pollutants are an even bigger threat. If we fail to do our bit to clean our own air, we also lose the moral ground to point fingers at other countries. With the right policies, programmes and mindset, the air we breathe would be a lot healthier.  \nCorruption ails almost every sector in Nepal. It is believed to be one major factor discouraging investors, innovators, entrepreneurs, as well as service seekers. But following tremendous pressure from various sections of the society, government authorities have initiated investigations on some major corruption cases. The fake Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Tribhuvan University land encroachment, gold smuggling and cooperatives deposits embezzlement are cases that have been probed. Even high profile personalities such as a former Speaker, former ministers, top bureaucrats and powerful middlemen have been prosecuted.Currently, the embezzlement of billions of rupees deposited by thousands of people at hundreds of cooperatives across the country remains a hotly-debated issue. Politicians, a former top police official, and key officials running dozens of cooperatives are being investigated. Police have issued red corner notices against those who are on the run after embezzling deposits from various cooperatives. The Rastriya Swatantra Party chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, among other suspects, has been in custody for the past two months over his alleged involvement in the embezzlement. But other politicians and individuals close to top political leaders have been spared, it is alleged, under political pressure. Just like Lamichhane, Nepali Congress Vice-President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung, and federal parliament’s Public Accounts Committee chair Rishikesh Pokharel of the CPN-UML have been linked to the cases of embezzlement of funds from different cooperatives. Yet they were not being probed. Thankfully, there has been a breakthrough. The Morang District Court on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant against 25 suspects including Anjala Koirala, wife of PAC chair Pokharel, in connection with alleged financial irregularities in Uma-Gauri Agricultural Cooperative. Yet little seems to be happening in the case against Gurung. The Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police had in October recommended the police headquarter issue a red notice against Gurung’s former wife Jyoti, among others, on charges of embezzling cooperative deposits. Though Dhan Raj and Jyoti officially appear to have divorced, it seems the two were still jointly misusing funds even after the formal divorce. Also, the cross-party Parliamentary Special Probe Committee has suggested the authorities investigate the Congress leader’s involvement.When it comes to past investigations in major corruption scandals, the results have been mixed. The investigation agencies have produced some laudable results in a few cases, while they were criticised in other scams for sparing politicians while punishing civil servants and other individuals. So people still doubt their role. Many people believe investigating agencies, under pressure from influential leaders, first spare the politicians and their kin or, even if they are arrested, the cases against them are watered down to help the suspects get clean chit. Though cases were filed against high profile individuals in the fake refugee case, Lalita Niwas and gold smuggling scams, many of them have already been acquitted. People are thus rightly suspicious. To remove their doubts, first, the agencies should show the courage to work independently and stop waiting for signals from top politicians. Or the flawed justice process will backfire on the top politicians too. If the public comes to see that only those without access to power centres get punished while those close to top politicians and other power centres are spared, their faith in the country’s legal process will erode. So will their trust in the political parties. Now that investigation has started against the spouse of an UML leader, there should now be no delay in probing the Congress leader too.   \nFor years, politics has taken precedence over progress in Nepal’s higher education. Political parties have turned educational institutions into their playgrounds, weakening the foundation and values of these establishments. This is evident in the recent hullabaloo over the appointment of deans at Tribhuvan University (TU), Nepal’s oldest. The dean positions were vacant since June this year, and disagreements in the executive council over the selections had hindered the selection process before Dashain. The major political parties and their student unions did their best to manipulate the merit-based appointment system, while criticising each other for ‘politicising’ higher education. The tug-of-war between the parties finally ended with the appointment of deans in five study institutes and three faculties of the university. However, these appointments have once again laid bare the practice of bhagbanda between the CPN-UML, the Nepali Congress, and the CPN (Maoist Centre).For fair selection, the executive council issued procedures for appointing deans and formed recommendation committees to suggest candidates based on merit. However, these committees have no more than symbolic value in a country where corruption seeps into the very systems intended to eradicate it. When vice-chancellor Keshar Jung Baral tried to appoint the deans and campus chiefs based on “meritocracy”, the recommendation committee did not rank professors affiliated with the UML on top. This did not please the UML and Baral was criticised at the University’s senate meeting. Although the UML’s protest reflects its vested interests, Baral’s claim of merit-based dean recommendation is contaminated by his own controversial past, raising doubts over his intent. In February, then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had appointed Baral as vice-chancellor even though he was second in line after Chitra Bahadur Budhathoki.To sum up, meritocracy was seen only on paper, as wherever there was political interest, selections weren’t based on merit. Ultimately this time, three Congress-affiliated professors, and two each from the UML and the Maoist Centre, were appointed deans, in addition to one with no clear political ties. It is now well established that politicisation of higher education does a lot of harm. Once renowned for its academic excellence, India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University has devolved into a hotspot for political unrest, with strikes and protests harming its academic standing. Similarly, Karachi University in Pakistan has suffered a lot from political polarisation, resulting in on-campus violence and administrative blunders.The logic is straightforward: Those who have mastered academia are best equipped to understand and manage educational institutions. However, such reasoning does not work in Tribhuvan University, where the chancellor, the highest-ranking official in the university, is the prime minister. Although the universities’ laws authorise the prime minister, as an ex-officio chancellor, to appoint vice-chancellors from among the three names recommended by the search committees, the prime minister typically appoints individuals aligned with their party, triggering a domino effect that ultimately undermines the merit-based system. Such unnatural appointments to major positions in educational institutions in turn disrupt the university’s intellectual ecosystem. It is high time we got to the root of politicisation of education and nipped it in the bud. The political parties cannot be allowed to use educational institutions as an extension of party organisations and risk the future of hundreds of thousands of students. At a time when we are witnessing a mass exodus of students due to their increasing distrust in our higher education, political parties must step aside and allow those who understand the institutions the best to lead. It is about time we created an education system that works for the benefit of students rather than politicians. \nEvery year, the Everest region, one of Nepal’s major tourist hubs, draws thousands of mountaineers, trekkers, and high-end (luxury) tourists from the world over. Helicopter sightseeing, which is as popular as trekking and mountain climbing, caters to tourists willing to spend generously to get a close glimpse of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. Such sightseeing adventures also significantly benefit hotels, airlines, local businesses and the country’s overall economy. However, starting January 1, 2025, the Sagarmatha National Park has decided to impose a blanket ban on helicopter sightseeing tours in the region. This has sparked an acrimonious debate among stakeholders.This seemingly lucrative tourism practice has a darker side. While helicopters support tourism in the national park and surrounding region, they are harmful to the wild animals living in the park’s relatively undisturbed areas. According to official data, there are over 6,000 chopper flights in the Everest region during spring and autumn—the peak tourist seasons. These flights cause excessive noise pollution and disrupt the wildlife’s feeding and breeding patterns. Low-flying helicopters are particularly dangerous to the Himalayan Tahr and Himalayan Goral. According to park sources, some animals are dying by jumping off the cliffs due to the abrupt, loud noises of the choppers. Others are fleeing their natural habitats and straying into nearby villages where they pose challenges to local communities. Thus the park’s concern about wildlife is understandable. It is also home to the world’s rarest species, including snow leopards and red pandas. The protection of these animals cannot be overlooked as it helps maintain biodiversity and contributes to wildlife tourism. According to park officials, other reasons, including haphazard landing of the copters and suspicion of transport of wildlife contraband also prompted them to take such an action. However, the abrupt and arbitrary manner in which the ban was imposed is concerning as it will affect the region’s tourism. Tour operators, helicopter companies, as well as the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the country’s civil aviation regulator, have criticised the ban made without consultations and exploration of alternatives. The CAAN has also clarified that the park has no legal basis to enforce such a ban.Nepal’s tourism sector is still in the post-Covid recovery phase. To make things worse, the European Union has extended its ban on Nepali airlines. Entrepreneurs who have invested in tourism are still suffering big losses. At this juncture, high-end tourism products like helicopter sightseeing could be a lifesaver for the ailing industry. So rather than blaming each other, the park and civil aviation authorities should try to find common ground and opt for a more balanced approach. As experts have suggested, establishing designated flight corridors away from sensitive wildlife habitats or conservation areas could be a viable solution to cut noise pollution. If concerns of the national park authority related to contraband and haphazard landings are genuine, monitoring activities in the region should be strengthened, and the aviation watchdog should hold the operators involved accountable. Wildlife and tourism are lifelines of our economy and there is a need to maintain a calibrated balance between the two. We believe, with a little more thought, a way can be worked out for them to coexist.  \nIt has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nChina-Nepal relations are stable, with China emphasizing non-intervention and encouraging mutual respect and economic cooperation. China anticipates Nepal's potential as a hub for trade between China and India, while denying interference in Nepal's internal affairs through party-to-party engagement, which it claims is based on mutual understanding and respect for sovereignty. Prime Minister Oli's upcoming visit to China is expected to further enhance bilateral cooperation and political trust.\nFormer Indian Chief Election Commissioner SY Quraishi emphasizes the importance of credible elections for democracy, discusses the challenges posed by money in politics, and raises concerns about the increasing influence of social media and artificial intelligence on electoral processes.\nA mild westerly disturbance brings partial cloud cover to some provinces and fog to Tarai and Valleys, potentially impacting various sectors.\nA weak westerly disturbance brings partly cloudy skies, light rain, and snowfall to Nepal's Koshi Province, while fog in Tarai regions prompts caution.\nWesterly winds are causing partial cloudiness in hilly and mountainous regions, with potential light snowfall in Gandaki Province's mountains.\nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that the country is currently experiencing the influence of a westerly wind, resulting in predominantly clear weather across most regions. According to the Division, Sunday will see mainly clear skies nationwide during the day and night. However, some parts of the Terai are experiencing mist or fog in the morning, which may cause temporary disruptions to daily life, transportation, and aviation. Residents of the high hills and Himalayan regions in Gandaki Province, Karnali Province, and Sudurpaschim Province have been advised to prepare for possible light snowfall over the coming days. \n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe District Government Attorney Office in Kaski has filed cases against Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane and 30 other individuals at the Kaski District Court in connection with the Suryadarshan Cooperative fraud case.Cooperatives fraud, organised crime and money laundering cases have been filed at the district court against Lamichhane, seeking 15 years of imprisonment and recovery of Rs278.9 million from him.The District Attorney's Office in Kaski submitted a charge-sheet against 44 accused, including Lamichhane. Among them are 31 individuals and eight institutions. Five others have been made defendants so as to confiscate their properties.The attorney’s office states in the charge-sheet that a money laundering case has been filed against Lamichhane as he was involved in transferring deposits from the Suryadarshan Cooperative to his personal bank account as well as the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network, where he was the managing director.However, Lamichhane claimed while recording his statement with the attorney that he had no knowledge of the money transferred to his or the company’s bank accounts from the cooperative. According to the office, former home minister Lamichhane and former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, along with Lila Pachhai, Ram Bahadur Khanal, and Krishna Bahadur Gurung, face charges of cooperatives fraud, organised crime, and money laundering. Additionally, cases have been filed against eight companies involved in the scam, said Khyam Narayan Lamichhane, acting registrar at the court.In the chargesheet, the police determined that as much as Rs1.514 billion needed to be recovered from the accused. The police advised the district attorney to file cases against them on organised crime, cooperatives fraud and money laundering charges. The police investigation report states that in the case of Lamichhane, he should be sentenced to 4 to 6 years in prison for cooperatives fraud, with an additional 50 percent jail term for organised crime, plus 2 to 15 years in prison, as well as a fine amounting to double the embezzled amount for money laundering.Kaski police claimed that Lamichhane was involved in financial transactions of the Gorkha Media Network even after he quit the company as its shareholder and managing director. Police claimed in the chargesheet that the RSP chief issued payments through cheques to various individuals and cooperatives after he disassociated from the company.“This defendant [Lamichhane] issued cheques to various individuals, companies and cooperatives through the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account in Global IME Bank even after he sold the network’s shares. The laboratory test report shows that the signatures in the cheques match Lamichhane’s,” reads the charge-sheet.The charge-sheet claims that Lamichhane, in collusion with Suryadarshan Cooperative’s chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, embezzled the money of the depositors so as to cause losses to the cooperative’s depositors and to benefit himself and the company. In a bid to avert legal action, the accused carried out fake transactions with false details, imaginary names and address, says the charge-sheet.Meanwhile, the Kaski District Police has officially requested Speaker Devraj Ghimire to suspend RSP chair and House of Representatives member Lamichhane from his parliamentary position. The move follows the filing of a chargesheet against Lamichhane under the Money Laundering Prevention Act 2008 in the Kaski District Court.According to Clause 27 of the Money Laundering Prevention Act, Lamichhane is subject to automatic suspension once charges are filed. This clause mandates that officials facing such charges remain suspended until the case is resolved. Speaker Ghimire is expected to make the suspension official by posting a notice on the parliamentary bulletin board, as the House is not currently in session.The Kaski District Court charge-sheet reveals that Lamichhane and his associates allegedly embezzled Rs278.9 million. The charges include cooperatives fraud (with penalties of 4–6 years imprisonment), organised crime (an additional 50 percent jail term), and money laundering (2–15 years imprisonment and fines double the embezzled amount).Lamichhane, who represents Chitwan’s constituency-2 in Parliament and leads the RSP parliamentary party, now faces legal and political challenges as investigations proceed.On Friday, the Kaski District Attorney’s Office had filed a supplementary charge-sheet against Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, chairman of Suryadarshan Cooperative, and 18 others in connection with a large-scale cooperatives fraud case.The charge-sheet, submitted on Friday, includes accusations of organised crime and money laundering alongside the earlier allegations of cooperatives fraud.Lamichhane and Joshi, among others, have been accused of diverting deposits from Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative, Chitwan-based Sahara Cooperative, Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperative and Parsa-based Sano Paila Cooperative to the Gorkha Media Network that ran the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television. Lamichhane, Joshi and Rai, among others, were partners in the media company. Lamichhane quit the media company to join politics in June 2022.A special parliamentary probe panel formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has recommended the concerned government authorities investigate Lamichhane, Rai and Joshi, among others, on charges of cooperatives fraud. \n\nWith the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, the Ministry of Health and Population has stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Nepal reported the latest case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the disease. Nepal confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year, when a 60-year-old foreign national had tested positive.“We have increased health screenings of passengers entering the country from abroad, as per the instruction of the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Kanchhi Maya Twanju, a health worker deployed at the health desk set up at the Tribhuvan International Airport. “We have been instructed to send passengers having fever and those showing symptoms of mpox infection directly to hospitals.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries. Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases.Along with stepping up screening of the passengers entering the country via TIA, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have alerted dermatologists about the risk of an outbreak of mpox virus in the country and have requested them to refer suspected cases for testing,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We will take additional measures following consultations with stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation’s Nepal representatives.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks since it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases of infection can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions, saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.“We didn’t expect that the infected person would come from Saudi Arabia, as there is no outbreak currently,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “This incident shows that the deadly disease may come from any country, and we must remain vigilant and prepare agencies concerned accordingly.”Doctors say preventing an outbreak of the deadly viral disease is not the sole responsibility of a single health agency, and it is impossible to do so.“Every agency and person, including passengers, should shoulder the responsibility and take preventive measures,” Pun stated.Mpox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.Meanwhile, health officials informed that the condition of the infected man is normal and he will remain in hospital isolation for an additional two weeks.They said that they are also working to trace close contacts between the patients on the plane and the taxi driver who took him to the hospital. \nAmending the constitution was a key promise of the seven-point agreement signed between Nepal’s two largest political parties, the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, in early July while forming the government led by KP Sharma Oli. But almost six months on, this ambitious promise remains unfulfilled. Earlier in September, the ruling coalition parties agreed to hold extensive discussions about amending the constitution. The parties said that the amendment process would only proceed after consulting key political parties and stakeholders. Three months after such an agreement, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, speaking at a party function in Kathmandu on Sunday, said a mechanism to amend the constitution would be formed within a few days. Thapa also added that the mechanism would be pragmatic and that amendments would be made cautiously. “The debate on amending the constitution has begun,” Thapa said, ‘Within a few days, Congress and UML will form a mechanism. We will handle this cautiously since there is no room for adventures. We will also have a dialogue with other political parties.” He said that the constitution cannot be amended just because Congress and UML want it. It will be done only after a broad understanding among the Maoist, Madhesi and other political parties. “After reaching an agreement with all parties and stakeholders, we will amend only the minimum provisions to ensure the smooth functioning of the constitution,” Thapa said.“We must create a situation where one political party can run the government for a period. There are some other issues we would like to address through amendments, which will be made with caution,” Thapa added. A fractured election mandate has resulted in political instability at both federal and provincial levels, and calls have grown for constitutional revision to reform the current electoral system.However, leaders of the ruling parties have expressed seemingly differing views regarding the amendment process and the formation of the mechanism. While Congress General Secretary Thapa stressed the need for forming a mechanism within a few days, UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula said they are still discussing the structure of the mechanism.Similarly, speaking in Dang on December 8, UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel had said the amendment of the constitution would only start after the election to the National Assembly, which is a year and a half away.“Our leadership wants consensus among all parties for revising the constitution,” Bartaula told the Post. “However, we have yet to discuss the structure of the mechanism and the nitty gritty of the amendment.” General Secretary Pokharel said the ruling parties do not have two-thirds majority in the National Assembly so the agenda of amending the constitution cannot move forward until they have the required majority in the upper house.”At present, the ruling coalition cannot win the support of the CPN (Maoist Centre) on the issue of amending the constitution, therefore, amendment will be possible only after the power equation in the upper house shifts after its next election, Pokharel argued. Maoist Centre has seen the agreement between Congress and UML to amend the constitution with suspicion.Although the ruling coalition has a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives, it falls short in the National Assembly. The Congress-UML needs the support of at least 40 members in the 59-member upper house. While the Congress commands the seats of 16, UML has 10 members in the Upper House, which makes the coalition short of 14 lawmakers for the two-thirds majority. The Maoist Centre is the largest party in the upper house with 17 seats, and the coalition partners will need the support of all other political parties in the National Assembly if Maoist Centre refuses to pass any amendment. One-third of the National Assembly's members are elected every two years. The last election was in January; the next will be in January 2026 if the Congress-UML coalition survives until then. And even in a best-case scenario, where the two parties won all one-third of the seats up for grabs, they would only win 19 out of the 59-member assembly. Currently, the Congress-UML has 26 seats in the National Assembly. When one-third of the seats are vacant, the number of seats for both parties will also decrease. This means the coalition is not guaranteed to reach a comfortable two-thirds majority without the support of other fringe parties even after the next National Assembly election. What then? Political experts, therefore, believe that numerical strength alone won’t work. The constitution can be amended if the two ruling parties with a strong majority in the House of Representatives intend to do so. Congress and UML indeed have a strong majority in the House. With a few smaller forces backing, they can manage the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution,” Professor of Political Science Krishna Khanal said in the latest interview with the Post. “However, when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So, numerical strength alone won’t work.” He further says the constitutional amendment has not progressed in the past five months because the political parties have used it to get to power without genuine commitment to reform.  \nThe scan and pay system for Nepali travellers in India planned for this December will likely be delayed due to a commission issue, according to an operator privy to this matter.“In India, no charges are levied when paying through the quick response (QR) code. But when Nepalis start paying via QR code in India, a certain commission should be paid to Nepali banks for this service,” one payment operator said, wishing not to be named.“Now, who will pay the commission as merchants provide the service without charges?”There is no regulation regarding commissions or charges to be paid to Nepali banks on every transaction.In Nepal, when Indian travellers pay through the QR code, minimal standard charges of 1.95 percent are applied to merchants per transaction upon receiving payment via UPI-enabled payment apps. Consumers or merchants are not charged for payments from UPI-linked bank accounts. The UPI, or Unified Payments Interface, is an instant real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to facilitate inter-bank transactions through mobile phones.In India, when a wallet user makes a payment, the merchant acquirer pays the interchange fee to the wallet issuer. Whether the acquirer will pass this fee to the merchant has not been determined. The interchange fee of up to 1.1 percent applies only on transactions above IRs2,000 to online merchants and large retailers. Furthermore, interchange fees do not apply to peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and small businesses in the P2PM category.India has mandated a zero-charge framework for UPI transactions from January 1, 2020. This means that UPI charges are nil for users and merchants alike.This issue in Nepal has delayed the activation of QR codes for Nepali travellers in India. This is a major hurdle to Nepalis making QR code payments in India, the source added.Operators say multiple discussions have been held regarding the commission issue, including the amount or percentage of the commission to be provided to Nepali banks and who will bear the cost. But there has been no logical conclusion so far.“India’s central bank is also discussing the issue with banks there,” according to the operator.“So it will still take a few months for Nepalis to make QR code payments in India.” Nepal is technically ready to start QR payments in India with approval from Nepal’s central bank. However, unless the Indian side gives a go-ahead, Nepal cannot start the QR payment in India.Nepal even has already conducted a successful trial transaction in India.In September, Nabil Bank trialled transactions through its mobile banking app in Mumbai, India, and achieved a successful result.The Reserve Bank of India needs to provide approval for payment system operators, and banks also need to show their readiness to start the service, operators said.On June 1 last year, Nepal and India signed a memorandum of understanding for cross-border digital payment to ease digital transactions for business people, students, and tourists from both countries.Nepal Clearing House Limited (NCHL) and National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) International Payments Limited signed and exchanged the memorandum of agreement on behalf of their respective organisations in New Delhi, India.The digital remittance under cross-border digital payment service initiated through a government-to-government agreement has also been delayed from the Indian side.NCHL agreed to a cross-border digital remittance service. However, a year after the agreement, the service has yet to start.NCHL has a 10 percent investment from Nepal Rastra Bank and 90 percent from other commercial banks.The central bank handed NCHL the work of establishing and operating a national payment switch and card.In September last year, Fonepay Payment Service Ltd, Nepal’s largest payment network and NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), the international arm of the National Payments Corporation of India, agreed to launch the first QR code-based payment solution between Nepal and India.On March 1, Indians in Nepal were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones.The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes. The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash as the Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.Fonepay said that initially it received transactions of Rs2–3 million daily. Now it reaches around Rs7–8 million daily on weekends or during the tourist season and around Rs5 million daily on normal days.Indians making QR code payments in Nepal are gradually growing as many Indians still do not know about the service availability in Nepal, said Fonepay.Nepal Rastra Bank has imposed rules and regulations for banks to set a daily transaction limit of IRs100,000 while making QR code payments in India. \nThe government has withdrawn a controversial provision from the ‘Bill to amend some Nepal Acts’ that envisioned allowing the withdrawal of criminal cases committed under political cover.The Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on May 10 last year had registered the bill at the Parliament Secretariat to amend Section 116 of the Criminal Procedure Code-2017 so as to clear the hurdles to withdrawing insurgency-era cases of “political nature”.Section 64 of the amendment bill has a provision that says cases sub judice in any court against anyone from a party or a group that conducted violent protests in the past but is carrying out its activities peacefully now, based on the constitution and the law can be withdrawn.In the bill, the government has added a sub-section under section 116 of the code, which ultimately aims at withdrawing the cases from all tiers of courts—Supreme, High and District—against political leaders. Participating in the discussion over the bill in the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives on Sunday, Law Minister Ajay Kumar Chaurasiya said that Section 64 of the bill had been drawn.“It has to be withdrawn as it might lead to impunity,” said the minister, adding that the decision was made with consent from Dhanraj Gurung, who in the capacity of law minister had registered the bill.Prior to Chaurasiya, Uday Raj Sapkota, secretary at the ministry, had revealed that the government had decided to withdraw the provision.The government holds the authority to produce the bill. It can also withdraw any bill or a part with consent from Parliament. Though a majority of lawmakers welcomed the government’s move, those from the CPN (Maoist Centre) objected to it. Claiming that the provision was introduced to implement past agreements with political forces such as those led by CK Raut and Netra Bikram Chand. Maoist lawmakers have threatened to register notes of dissent if the provision is withdrawn. “The government, in the past, signed deals with different political forces agreeing to withdraw the charges against them. It is the government's responsibility to abide by the agreements,” said Ram Kumar Rai, a Maoist Centre lawmaker.“In fact, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli, who also leads the government now, had forged the agreement. Instead of implementing it, the government is withdrawing the provision.”The preparations by the Dahal government to amend the Criminal Procedure Code had landed into controversy for suspicions that it was aimed at withdrawing the insurgency-era cases of atrocities.Even the National Human Rights Commission, organising a press meet, had objected to the move saying it was deeply concerned about the amendment bill. It argued there was a high possibility that the amendment would lead to the withdrawal of conflict-era charges of human rights violations by giving them political colour.The commission also sought the government’s clarification on the matter though the Dahal administration didn’t respond to it. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has received 63,718 complaints. Separately, 3,223 cases were lodged with the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, the disappearance commission is investigating only 2,484 cases saying that others do not fall under its jurisdiction.There are also several cases under consideration in various courts against Maoist Centre leaders and security personnel in connection with the crimes committed during the decade-long insurgency. If the bill got through Parliament, it would give a legitimate way for the government to arbitrarily withdraw the cases.After months-long gap, the House committee has resumed deliberation over the bill that has been under consideration for one-and-a-half years. As the government prepares to call the winter session of federal parliament in January, the Speaker, along with the government, wants the House committees to forward the bills, with them, to the plenary.Sixteen bills are under consideration in various parliamentary committees, also called mini parliaments. \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) was formed in August 2021 by a group of dissident CPN-UML leaders including two former party chiefs and ex-prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal. The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders. We are thinking of concluding this process [of welcoming him] soon.What about Bhim Rawal joining the party?Unhappy with the party leadership, he has been inactive in the UML but he has not made up his mind to join our party.Is finalising Gautam’s hierarchy and role in the party taking time?There won’t be an issue in the case of Bamdev ji. But overall, the number of leaders in our party is big. In the Chinese Communist Party, there are only seven members in the Politburo Standing Committee and 17 members in Other Politburo Members. But there are 24 members in our party’s central secretariat, 41 in the standing committee and 108 members in the politburo. Those who get a candidacy in the election celebrate but those who don’t get a ticket become inactive. Some others fight for ministerial posts. Yet others complain about not getting a ‘lucrative’ ministry. We have to manage them all.What about reunifying the party with the UML or the Maoist Centre? Many say leaders are more comfortable with the Maoist Centre but party cadres are for rejoining the UML.Most of our cadres are from the UML background. That might have played a role. But at present there is no possibility of our reunification with the UML. Also, the situation isn’t right to forge unity with the Maoist Centre.It is said that there is pressure from party members for reunification with the UML?That’s not true. There is a negative view about us in the UML and therefore our party rank and file wouldn’t be ready to surrender. Some might be lobbying for entry into the UML for personal benefits. Even if some join the UML, it won’t be easy for them there.But some noted leaders such as Ram Kumari Jhakri who had strongly supported you in the course of building this party have said that the Unified Socialist can’t run like this and that it is better to merge with the UML?I also enquired about her remarks but she said her intent had been misunderstood. But I repeat that there is no possibility of unity with the UML. We studied the possibility of unity with the Maoist Centre but concluded that we can’t accept Maoism and we also found their election symbol inappropriate. So the process has stopped. For now, we will concentrate on strengthening our own party.How is the Unified Socialist different from the UML?Our’s is a policy-driven party and not leader-centric. Committee system prevails in our organisation, not the leader’s orders. We discard rightist approaches and follow revolutionary ideas. We don’t see these qualities in the UML. Only our party has a policy of ‘Socialism with Nepali Characteristics’. We prioritise our agenda based on justice, fair distribution, production and good governance. There was a period when socialism stressed only on equality and therefore some termed it a distribution of poverty but we believe socialism as a principle of prosperity. Capitalism focuses only on profits even at the cost of people’s lives and wars but socialism values people’s lives and livelihoods. So, we are clearly against capitalism and in favour of socialism. But there are different forms of capitalism. We are for promoting national capitalism and eliminating comprador capitalists. We need to invite and welcome foreign investment to increase production in the country.Your party held its general convention in July first week and it took months to elect other office bearers and assign roles and responsibilities. Why?It shouldn’t have happened. Some wrong elements entered our party. Some showed immaturity by raising the issue of ‘new generation’. That spoiled the situation. Building a party is not easy. It calls for many things including ideological clarity, capacity to lead the organisation efficiently and an accepted personality. We have to learn from this episode and remove the mistrust that cropped up in this course. \nThe Maoist party, which joined mainstream politics by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006, has always had a peculiar relation with semantics. In the insurgency days, the top Maoist leaders were not known by their real names but their noms de guerre. Partly, this was done to hide their identity, and partly, it was their way of overcoming individualism and pursuing a larger cause. Thus Pushpa Kamal Dahal became ‘Prachanda’, Baburam Bhattarai ‘Laldhoj’, Barsha Man Pun ‘Ananta’ and so on. The party has itself undergone various name changes to arrive at its current avatar of CPN (Maoist Centre). There are often rumours of the party leaders mulling removing the ‘Maoist’ tag. Despite this seeming flexibility, it must hurt all those involved in the decade-long war when the country’s top court repeatedly rejects their attempts to recognise the janayuddha (‘people’s war’). Most recently, the apex court ruled that it is unconstitutional to use the term in official documents. A year ago, it had rejected the-then Maoist-led government’s efforts to declare a public holiday on ‘People’s War Day’. With their strongest claim to political space—a self-sacrificing war waged for the benefit of the downtrodden and the marginalised communities—legally rejected, the use of violence that took nearly 17,000 lives, and left countless more disabled and ‘disappeared’, will be questioned even more in the days ahead. The Maoists and a section of the intelligentsia continue to talk up the war’s achievements: There would apparently have been no republican federal state without the war. Or a system of reservations for the marginalised communities. (Even this newspaper acknowledges the Maoist role in these developments.) Yet it is as important to factor in the party’s evolution in the post-war years. The causes that the party once held dear—particularly issues of the poorest and most marginalized sections of the society—have repeatedly been sacrificed at the altars of Dahal’s naked quest for power. These days, there is little to choose between the Maoist Centre and the old ‘bourgeois’ parties in the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML that the former rebels once held responsible for all social ills. Times are also changing. Those born in the past three decades have little or no memory of the war. Instead, they have seen how its supposed achievements have been endlessly abused by leaders from across the political spectrum. For these younger folks, the idea of getting political legitimacy through a war waged in the name of Mao—a bloodthirsty dictator from another time and place—just does not sound right. Of late, the CPN (Maoist Centre) party has been making much of its ‘stellar’ showing in the recent bypolls. This, say party leaders, is an indication that their popularity is again on the up. That is unlikely. These small pockets of electoral success aside, indications are that people are highly dissatisfied by the functioning of the Maoist party as well as its chair Dahal. The loss in support among its once core constituencies is particularly alarming. Unless the Maoist leadership is ready to internalise and acknowledge how it has let these constituencies down and to commit to rectifying its mistakes, an electoral comeback looks tough. Unfortunately, for Dahal and his followers, there is no going back to the old-school janayuddha either.   \nHow Gagan Thapa wishes there were more than 24 hours in a day! He would then be able to meet most of his social obligations. As preparations get underway for the next Nepali Congress general convention, due at the end of 2025, the party general secretary is routinely inundated with meeting requests. Cadres start lining up outside his Ratopul home early in the morning as Thapa, holed up in the kitchen inside, is busy packing tiffin boxes for his two girls. Now 48, the ex-health minister believes the 15th general convention will be a make or break event for him. He has seen some erosion in his fame following the entry of new forces in Nepali politics. The best way to stem this slide would be to win the party presidency and go into the next general elections as the party’s prime ministerial face.Given the fast pace of change in national politics, he might not get another shot at leading the party—or the country as prime minister. This is why he is keen on mending ties with current President Sher Bahadur Deuba. As things stand, the incumbent president could have the final say in the pick of his successor. “I believe there is an undeclared understanding between the two: Deuba will next lead the government, and Gagan will look after party affairs,” says a trusted adviser of Thapa. In this telling, Deuba realises the futility of pushing his wife, Arzu Rana Deuba, up the party hierarchy. She is not a popular figure among the Congress rank and file. So the best bet for Arzu’s continued relevance in the party is to get Thapa to agree to ‘adjusting’ her in some role after Deuba steps down. In case Thapa declines to do so, the desperate husband might conceivably offer a similar bargain to other aspirants for party presidency. Some say the five-time prime minister, the political animal that he is, will not quietly bow out of politics even after he relinquishes the party chair. That he will continue to pull the strings from behind the curtain. That is unlikely. Deuba’s influence in the party, now at its apogee, will at once decline when he is no longer in a position to dole out plum ministries and party posts. Coming back to Thapa, for all his strengths, it would be a mistake to assume the party presidency will fall into his lap. If, for example, Shekhar Koirala is in the fray, Thapa will be going toe to toe with a formidable foe. “In my reckoning, Koirala can beat Thapa if the two face off in the general convention,” says Tula Narayan Shah, a keen political observer while cupping a glass of steaming peach black tea. The general convention representatives vote in blocks. Shah, a Nepali Congress footsoldier in his student days, thinks the Koirala name still carries a lot of weight for many such Congressi blocks. “Or how could Shashank get the most votes in the election for central committee members in the last general convention? What other qualification did he have?” Also working in Koirala’s favour will be his long preparation for the top job— “while never holding a government portfolio,” Shah adds. Moreover, many in the Congress believe that while Thapa has age on his side, and will get another shot in the future, Koirala, at 74, may not have that luxury. But even the first-level elections to choose Congress general convention delegates have not started. It would thus be premature to talk of new factions which will only start solidifying around a handful of leaders at the end of 2025. The likes of Purna Bahadur Khadka and Bimlendra Nidhi, another two aspirations for the top job who too are long-time Deuba acolytes, would have some say in how things shape up. So would Shashank Koirala and Prakash Man Singh. Yet a compelling case can be made for why the Congress would do well to go into the next general elections under Gagan Thapa. With the country looking for a clean break from the past, this next generation leader with sound intellect and unmatched oratory will be a good electoral fit. He also has a clean image. Again, no other top Congress leader is anywhere close to the MP from Kathmandu-4 on any of these fronts. Yes, Thapa’s popularity has gone down. But if he gets to lead the party again, he is more than capable of regaining much of the lost lustre. A leader who is always in the spotlight is bound to get into some controversies. As has Thapa. Someone who came to prominence during the 2006 April Revolution, he can sometimes sound more like a rabble-rouser than a cool-headed thinker. Really, when you have natural swag, why sweat it? His relations with the party chief have also come under scrutiny. Even though Deuba has made one after another mistake, Thapa has blunted his criticism of the party president. Thapa quietly accepted the seven-point midnight Congress-UML deal even though he, the party’s general secretary, was kept in complete darkness. A consummate politician, Thapa is clearly biding his time. But this also shows he thinks long term—always a good sign in a political leader.It would be hard to argue that the Congress and the larger Nepali polity will be better served with the party electing Shekhar Koirala or any other leader of the older generation than it will be by picking Thapa. If Thapa comes to power in the Congress, the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, the other two big parties, will also be forced to rethink their ossified leaderships: The UML is now under the thumb of KP Sharma Oli, just like Pushpa Kamal Dahal continues to maintain an absolute grip over the Maoist Centre. At this juncture, of the three major forces, the Congress appears by far the most democratic outfit. A seamless transfer of power to the torchbearer of the next generation will reinforce this image.  \nWomen play important roles in the lives of their husbands. In this column, I allude to the rare tales of remarkable women who reveal some unexplored aspects of literary writers and the influence these women had in their lives. This is evident from the stories of the wives of writers like Leo Tolstoy, PB Shelley, Laxmi Prasad Devkota and others mentioned in this article. Besides the women whose interviews are available, I would like to mention the roles of three notable women: Mandakini, Balakrishna Sama’s wife; Sushila Koirala, BP Koirala’s wife; and Manu Kumari Thapa, Lain Singh Bangdel’s wife.Creating Sushila Koirala’s character in my play Sandajuko Mahabharat (2015) was challenging. BP extensively mentioned her in his autobiographical writings. I briefly spoke with Sushilaji about Sama’s play, Ma, which she had directed and performed in Biratnagar in 1951, for which she is called the first Nepali woman director of a play. Sama clearly mentions Mandakini and her impact on his life. Her portraits, which he executed, can be seen in his house. Poet Kedar Man Vyathit once told me the Sama couple looked like a pair of doves. I know Manu didi’s impact on Bangdelji very well and have also written about her.This theme of women’s contribution has struck me for a few reasons. First, I met these women through my relationship with the writers. Second, I met some of them while Bindu Subedi, the story writer and editor of the Nepali section of the English-Nepali quarterly magazine Across, conducted their recorded interviews. She published the interviews of the wives of eight writers and poets under a telling and critical title, “These forgotten wives—birsieka shrimatiharu—of the late literary writers”, in two issues of the magazine. These interviews unfold the tales of the women who played significant roles in the lives of their writer husbands. It was a great privilege for me to attend some of these interviews. It gave me a chance to understand the power of these women and the ethics and challenges of the times they closely experienced. I was overwhelmed to hear how their influence on their husbands helped create the celebrated literary works. I especially recall meeting Mana Devi Devkota, wife of the eminent poet Laxmi Prasad Devkota, and Mishri Devi Shrestha, wife of poet Siddhicharan Shrestha. The other women interviewed in Across (February-April 1999) are Jyotsna Vyathit, poet Kedar Man Vyathit’s wife, and the wife of writer Keshav Raj Pindali. Ratna Lamichhane and Subarnaa Lamichhane, the wives of Shankar Lamichhane; Shova Aryal, wife of Bhairab Aryal; and Kanti Sherchan, wife of Bhupi Sherchan, are interviewed in another issue of the magazine (August-October 2001). Last year, I had the privilege of meeting Kantiji at the launch of the book Bhupi: A Daughter’s Memoir by Kavita Sherchan, Bhupi’s daughter. Only two remarkable women, Subarnaa Lamichhane and Kanti Sherchan, are alive today. Ratna and Subarnaa fondly speak about Lamichhane from individual perspectives, and their interviews show compassion. Ratna was deeply familiar with Shankar’s writings and his problems. Shova Aryal makes an interesting observation about her husband, Bhairav Aryal, who was famous for satire and humour in his writings. She says, “Gautama Buddha had left home leaving his wife Yashodhara and son Rahul behind, but our humour writer chose to die by leaving six children from the age of thirteen to two and a half, and a wife in the lurch.” In her interview, Kanti Sherchan praised Bhupi’s humanism, his sense of freedom and dedication to his work. These women’s stories about the condition of the writers’ angst, their inspirations and the times they fought with are rare studies for critics and researchers. The interviewer, Bindu Subedi, has written the following about the qualities and the enduring passion and compassion of the wives of the writers. These women, who bore the children and brought them up, fought minuscule battles in each case, sometimes too hard. They dealt with their husbands’ moods, hid their pain behind smiles, supported them through their most difficult phases of life and preserved their writings. Some of them even established awards in their husbands’ names, stayed beside them when they were ill and served and helped them. However, the writers have not written much in acknowledgement of the sacrifice of their wives. There are some exceptions, though. Siddhicharan Shrestha has written a poem about Mishridevi, and Vyathit often mentions Jyotsna’s name in his poems. Lain Singh Bangdel’s gratitude towards Manu is seen throughout his works. But literary critics do not mention these women’s contributions in their critical writings. When they do, they distort. The interviewer claims that this becomes clear after listening to these women.Mana Devi Devkota, who was 87 at the time of the interview in 2001, looked bright, confident and ready to share how she had been a good companion to her husband, Laxmi Prasad Devkota. I also went to see her then; I did not talk much with her except to express my pleasure to have met her. Devkota’s life was full of events and stories about writing. His lifestyle and writing habits are also interesting. Devkota, the editor of Yugvani, which was supposed to be an anti-Rana publication, went to Banaras with the anti-Rana rebels, whom Mana Devi Devkota referred to as ‘congress’. Mana Devi recounts a rare story to Bindu Subedi about how she went to Banaras to rescue the poet and safely brought him home. She faced several difficulties, and the ‘congress party’ people didn’t cooperate, as they were unhappy with her for taking Devkota back home. In addition to experiencing financial challenges in bringing him back and continuing their life, she also had to face the wrath of the Rana regime.These women have inspired their husbands at all the important moments. The structuralism of these women’s help is based on the male-centric praxis. The commonality between all these women is that they helped their husbands by being with them during their difficult and happy moments. Being physically present by listening to their writings and perennially inspiring them during hard times is obviously a daunting task.  \nIn today’s world, physical and mental health have emerged as major issues. Stress, anxiety and depression have become all too common. Similarly, physical ailments such as cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure and weakened immune systems are on the rise.Scientific research shows that stress negatively impacts the immune system. It makes individuals more vulnerable to diseases and contributes to other mental health problems like anxiety, depression and insomnia. Research reports also reveal that anxiety and depression significantly impair mental health by causing difficulties in work performance, affecting relationships and leading to social isolation, hopelessness and suicidal impulses. A recent World Health Organization report reveals that an estimated 5 percent of adults worldwide suffer from depression and mental health issues, which are the primary reasons behind the global suicide rate of over 700,000 deaths each year. In the wake of this situation, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution recognising December 21 as World Meditation Day. The day marks the importance of meditation, which has proven effective in reducing stress, promoting healing, increasing energy and thereby promoting peace and well-being in the world. This milestone was achieved through the strong advocacy of countries like Nepal, India, Liechtenstein, Sri Lanka and Mexico. This initiative has historical significance for Nepal. Meditation dates back to the Vedic civilisation, when rishis (sages) practised it in the Himalayas to attain spiritual wisdom and enlightenment. Lord Shiva, often revered as the first meditator, is connected to Nepal through sacred sites like Pashupatinath Temple. Gautam Buddha, who achieved enlightenment through deep meditation, further reinforced this connection to meditation. Moreover, meditation has remained central to the spiritual practices of Hinduism and Buddhism over the centuries, continuously shaping the country’s spiritual landscape. Current initiatives and prospectsThe Government of Nepal has recognised the significance of yoga, meditation and swajagaran (self-alerted awakening). It has incorporated meditation (along with yoga) into its policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2080-81, emphasising its role in key areas such as public administration, education, health, tourism and social development. The goal of this inclusion, as stated in the document, is to develop a healthy and ethical society across all three tiers of government—federal, provincial and local.Some local governments are now implementing this vision at the grassroots by developing localised school curricula that include yoga and meditation. This initiative is promising because research conducted among the younger generation and school-goers worldwide has shown that meditation and yoga help improve their attention span and are instrumental in managing stress and emotional control. Additionally, these practices increase optimism and improve creativity and intelligence. Further, yoga supports physical health by improving blood flow and detoxification, while meditation helps manage pain and become mindful. These practices work together to support the mental and physical health of the younger generation. This momentum is also reflected in Nepal’s growing interest in wellness tourism. Nepal's landscapes and spiritual heritage attract tourists who want to do yoga and meditation and experience Ayurveda and spa treatments in tranquil settings. Though few, there are hotels and resorts, Ayurveda hospitals, yoga trekking opportunities and specified places for yoga and meditation, such as yoga homes, ashrams and academies in and around Kathmandu. This trend establishes Nepal as a global hub for wellness tourism.Nepal can unlock greater promises in the future by integrating meditation, yoga and swajagaran campaigns in various areas of society. Notably, these efforts also align with Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims to ensure “good health and well-being.” Similarly, incorporating these practices into an ethical society can bring long-term benefits. Extending these practices into politics, administration and the private sector will also promote a mindful and ethically responsible society.Finally, integrating these practices can preserve Nepal’s cultural heritage and address modern-day challenges. Nepal can strengthen international relations, improve public health, address sustainability efforts, promote tourism and help achieve global peace by positioning itself as a global advocate for wellness through yoga and meditation, Way forwardStrong coordination between the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, media and Non-Resident Nepalis is very important to strengthen Nepal’s position as a global destination for wellness tourism. Nepal can attract more tourists seeking spiritual growth and wellness by spreading messages internationally. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, in consultation with its stakeholders, can be central in integrating yoga, meditation and swajagaran into school and university programmes. Academic institutions should now take the lead in teaching the art of staying alert by equipping learners with the skills to reflect inward and turn to themselves for clarity and balance. Such integration develops self-awareness and emotional resilience among learners and prepares them for personal and societal challenges. \nSocial activist Sunita Danuwar, a prominent advocate for trafficking survivors, passed away on Monday morning. She was 47. Her husband, Nrip Danuwar, said she was healthy on Sunday night but failed to wake up on Monday morning. “She was fine when we went to bed after dinner on Sunday. The alarm rang at 5:30am, and I tried to wake her up, but she didn’t respond. Her hands were cold,” Nrip said. “We took her to the hospital by 5:45am, but the hospital declared her dead.” Danuwar was a trafficking survivor and the founder and former president of Shakti Samuha. Since its establishment in 1996, the organisation has been empowering returnee trafficking survivors by providing shelter, legal aid, counselling, and vocational training. She also authored the book ‘Aansuko Shakti’. Her body has been kept at Nepal Medical College, Jorpati. She will be cremated at Pashupati Aryaghat after her family arrives from Udayapur.

It did not specify in what New Jersey city the walkout was occurring.Starbucks said the disruptions from the strike have no significant impact on its operations because only a small handful of US stores have been impacted.“Workers United proposals call for an immediate increase in the minimum wage of hourly partners by 64%, and by 77% over the life of a three-year contract. This is not sustainable,” the coffee chain said.The union is striking in 10 cities, also including Columbus, Ohio; Denver and Pittsburgh, during the busy holiday season that may impact the company’s Christmas sales.The company operates more than 11,000 stores in the United States, employing about 200,000 workers.Talks between Starbucks and the union hit an impasse with unresolved issues over wages, staffing and schedules, leading to the strike.Workers United warned on Friday that the strike could reach “hundreds of stores” by Tuesday, Christmas Eve.Starbucks began negotiations with the union in April. It said this month it had conducted more than eight bargaining sessions, during which 30 agreements had been reached. \nAcross Delhi, large billboards have come up wooing Indian travellers for a Disney cruise in Singapore, and some people are sitting up and taking notice.One family saw that bookings had begun for the Disney Adventure, the first Asia-based cruise ship of the Disney Cruise Line. To their disappointment, however, it is due to set sail in December 2025.“We thought it was starting this year and even made inquiries. But it’s only starting next year,” said Ms Karishma Mohan, 39, a mother of two children under the age of seven. The family is now considering a trip to Japan in March 2025.However, they are still keen on the Disney cruise, said Ms Mohan, a home baker whose husband works in the aviation sector. “The children have seen the advertisements, including on YouTube, so we will explore next year,” she said.The Mohans are among the growing ranks of middle-class Indian families who go on at least one overseas trip a year.“As consumers in India express their desire to increase spending on travel, the industry is set for healthy growth in coming years,” said Mr Abhay Prakash Singh, research analyst at Euromonitor International, a global business intelligence, market analysis and consumer insights firm.While Chinese tourists may still be the leader in global tourism spending, India is seen as the fastest-growing market for outbound tourism, expected to grow at 11 per cent annually for the next decade.Indian travellers went from 14th position globally on tourism spending in 2019 to eighth place by 2023, when 28.2 million Indians took overseas holidays and spent US$34.2 billion (S$46.3 billion), according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.In comparison, 87 million Chinese travelled overseas in 2023, spending US$196.5 billion, according to UN tourism data.The outlook for Indian travellers, however, remains robust. They are expected to become the fourth-largest global travel spenders by 2030, according to a report by Booking.com and McKinsey.Indians are expected to spend US$55.4 billion by 2034, according to another report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.Tourism is being fuelled by a growing middle class – expected to double by 2047 from the current 432 million – amid increasing disposable incomes, a stronger desire to travel and expanding aviation links.The last factor means they can go farther afield.“Interestingly, prior to the pandemic in the year of 2019, the Asia-Pacific region held the biggest share of outbound spending by Indian travellers,” said Euromonitor’s Mr Singh. “However, in 2023, the Middle East and Africa region dominated, with close to one-third share in overall outbound spending by Indians.”Ms Sanchari Ganguly, 39, is one who likes the path less travelled.Her next holiday is a toss-up between Finnish Lapland and a driving trip through Lithuania and Latvia in the Baltics.“I want a unique experience as well as to discover a new country,” she said.Ms Ganguly, who left her job to look after her son, added: “I am just trying to figure out if Lapland is doable with a five-year-old. I am doing my research right now.”Her family spends 10 per cent of their annual income, which translates to around 500,000 rupees (S$7,970) to 550,000 rupees, on their yearly overseas vacation.Ms Ganguly, whose husband is a banker, had planned to visit Singapore for the Taylor Swift concert earlier in 2024. But when she could not get hold of tickets, the family travelled in June to Georgia and Azerbaijan instead.“We do one big overseas trip every year, and if it’s very expensive, it’s the only trip that we will do. After all, we are a single-income household right now. Otherwise, we do small breaks within India,” she said. “I want my son to travel. Now he asks, ‘Where are we going?’”‘They want more experiences’According to travel-banking fintech platform Niyo, 58 countries now offer visa-free or visa-on-arrival facilities for Indian tourists.It also found that nearly half of Indian travellers made last-minute plans for foreign holidays, landing on countries that offered the easiest visa regime.While the Indian passport is relatively weak, according to the widely cited Henley Passport Index, an increasing number of countries appear to be wooing Indian tourists with an eye on the growing potential.The Henley index for 2024, for instance, ranks India 84th in the world, with visa-free access to 58 countries. This puts it behind Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Madagascar, Gabon and Burkina Faso.The index ranks Singapore as having the strongest passport, with access to 195 countries.Still, in 2024, Indian tourists became eligible for online visas for Japan; five-year, multi-entry visas for Dubai; and visas on arrival in Indonesia and Iran, among other destinations.More countries are expected to follow suit in 2025, with growing aviation links further boosting travel.In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia launched a “Shaandaar (spectacular in Hindi) Saudi” campaign, hoping to attract 7.5 million Indians over the next decade as it diversifies its economy to include tourism.Indian carriers such as Air India and Indigo, which are expanding their fleets, have also been rolling out more routes, both within India and overseas.Air India in 2024 started flights five days a week between Delhi and Hanoi in Vietnam, which in 2023 was the top destination searched for on Google by Indians.“The advent of low-cost carriers on international routes, offering direct connectivity, has further boosted outbound travel from India,” noted Mr Pushan Sharma, director of research at Crisil Market Intelligence and Analytics.“Emerging tourism destinations like Tbilisi, Bali, Male, Almaty, Tashkent, Hanoi and Baku are also now more accessible.”Mr Subhash Goyal, founder chairman of STIC Travel Group, said: “Indian tourists are sought after. And we don’t have backpackers. It is the upper middle class and super rich who are travelling.”He said that previously, “people used to go sightseeing. Today, they want more experiences. They will participate in some festivals, join in some cultural programmes and experience local cuisine and culture”.Countries are also trying to woo Indian tourists with curated experiences.SriLankan Airlines, for example, has introduced a special tour package for Indian visitors called the “Ramayana Trail”, with travel to spots connected to the Hindu epic.Singapore still a favouriteIn 2022, according to India’s Tourism Ministry, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was the top destination for Indians, followed by Saudi Arabia, the US, Singapore and Britain.Singapore’s growing appeal as a top destination for Indians still holds, noted Mr Markus Tan, Singapore Tourism Board’s (STB) regional director for India, the Middle East, South Asia and Africa, in an interview with The Straits Times.For 2024, Singapore welcomed one million visitors from India by October, an approximate 12 per cent increase from the same period in 2023, said Mr Tan, with expectations that year-end figures would reach 1.17 million to 1.2 million Indian tourists.According to data by Indian online travel company MakeMyTrip on travel search and booking trends between Dec 16 and 31 for year-end travel in 2024, Singapore ranks as the third-most searched-for destination on the platform, with searches up 11 per cent year on year. It ranks behind UAE and Thailand.India is Singapore’s third-largest source market for tourism as at Oct 31, after China and Indonesia. STB expects Singapore to remain among Indian tourists’ top destinations in 2025 as the two countries mark 60 years of bilateral cultural relations.And Indian tourists are gaining a reputation for being big shoppers.In 2024, until June, Indian travellers in Singapore spent $776.5 million, out of which 28 per cent was spent on shopping, followed by 19 per cent on accommodation and 15 per cent on food and beverage. The year before – from January to December 2023 – Indians spent $1.53 billion, out of which 25 per cent was spent on shopping.“Studies also suggest that a rising number of Indians are shopping for luxury goods when travelling overseas, and Singapore is perfectly positioned to cater to this demand,” said Mr Tan.“Healthy competition drives us all to innovate and enhance our offerings, and it’s encouraging to see that Singapore remains a top choice for Indian travellers.”The Indian traveller is only too ready to travel overseas as foreign destinations, in some cases, become as affordable as domestic travel.Crisil’s recent study revealed that for a couple travelling for five days during the festive season and staying in five-star accommodation, it is cheaper to go to Bangkok in Thailand than to the southern Indian state of Goa, sought after for its beaches.“The reason being, for the same hotel chain, the tariffs in Goa are almost double those in Bangkok,” said Mr Sharma.“Price parity between domestic and international destinations is also making foreign travel more accessible to Indians.”In association with the Asia News Network \nTens of thousands of people gathered in central Belgrade on Sunday to protest against President Aleksandar Vucic and his ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), whom they blame for a railway station roof collapse last month that killed 15 people.The concrete awning of the recently renovated roof of Novi Sad station caved in on Nov. 1, killing 14 and injuring three. One of the injured died later.Opposition leaders and the public have taken to the streets repeatedly, blaming the accident on shoddy construction resulting from government corruption and nepotism.The ruling coalition denies those charges, and Vucic has said those responsible must be held to account.The protesters on Sunday evening switched on the lights of their mobile phones and stood in silence for 15 minutes to commemorate the victims.Some shouted \"Vucic, thief!\". Others held up banners reading \"You have blood on your hands\".\"We came here to say ‘Stop’ to everything that has been happening since 2012 [when Vucic’s party took power],\" said Aleksa, 30, an IT expert from Novi Sad.\"We want to see an end to corruption and nepotism.\"Students at state universities in Belgrade, Kragujevac and Nis have been protesting for weeks to demand the release of all documents relevant to the renovation of the station, as well as criminal prosecution of officials responsible for the disaster.Every day they block traffic in front of their faculties for 15 minutes to commemorate the 15 victims. \nA 31-year-old man died, and another sustained critical injuries in a motorcycle accident in Dang on Sunday night. The deceased has been identified as Dil Prasad Khatri of ward 2 of Paribartan Rural Municipality in Rolpa, according to Police Inspector Prakash Thapa, information officer of the Area Police Office, Tulsipur. The accident occurred when the motorcycle, heading towards Jaspur from Tulsipur, lost control and overturned in ward 12 of Tulsipur Sub-Metropolitan City. Khatri, who was riding pillion, succumbed to his injuries during treatment at Nepalgunj Medical College in Kohalpur on Sunday night. The motorcyclist, 31-year-old Pankaj Khatri of ward 11 of Tulsipur, sustained critical injuries and is undergoing treatment at the same medical facility, Thapa said.   \nPresident-elect Donald Trump threatened to reassert US control over the Panama Canal on Sunday, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates to use the Central American passage and drawing a sharp rebuke from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino.Speaking to a crowd of supporters in Arizona, Trump also said he would not let the canal fall into the “wrong hands,” warning of potential Chinese influence on the passage.After the event, he posted an image on Truth Social of an American flag flying over a narrow body of water, with the comment: “Welcome to the United States Canal!”“Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal?” Trump said at AmericaFest, an annual event organised by Turning Point, an allied conservative group. “Because we’re being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we’re being ripped off everywhere else.”Trump’s comments were an exceedingly rare example of a US leader saying he could push a sovereign country to hand over territory. They also underlined an expected shift in US diplomacy under Trump, who has not historically shied away from threatening allies and using bellicose rhetoric when dealing with counterparts.“It was given to Panama and the people of Panama, but it has provisions,” Trump said of the canal, which was once owned by the United States but was handed over to Panama decades ago.“If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, quickly and without question.”In a recorded message released by Panama’s President Mulino on Sunday afternoon, the nation’s leader said that Panama’s independence was non-negotiable and that China had no influence on the canal’s administration. He also defended the passage rates Panama charged, saying they were not set “on a whim”.China does not control or administer the canal, but a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings (0001.HK) has long managed two ports located on the canal’s Caribbean and Pacific entrances.The United States largely built the canal and administered territory surrounding the passage for decades. But the United States and Panama signed a pair of accords in 1977 that paved the way for the canal’s return to full Panamanian control. The United States handed over control of the passage in 1999 after a period of joint administration.“Every square meter of the Panama Canal and the surrounding area belongs to Panama and will continue belonging (to Panama),” Mulino said in his statement, which was released on X.Trump then responded to Mulino: “We’ll see about that!”The waterway, which allows up to 14,000 ships to cross per year, accounts for 2.5% of global seaborne trade and is critical to US imports of autos and commercial goods by container ships from Asia, and for US exports of commodities, including liquefied natural gas.It is not clear how Trump would seek to regain control over the canal, and he would have no recourse under international law if he decided to make a play for the passage.This is not the first time Trump has openly considered territorial expansion.In recent weeks, he has repeatedly mused about turning Canada into a US state, though it is unclear how serious he is about the matter. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump expressed interest in buying Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He was publicly rebuffed by Danish authorities before any conversations could take place.Trump repeated the idea on Sunday, in a statement announcing his pick for ambassador to Denmark, Ken Howery, a former ambassador to Sweden.“For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” he wrote on Truth Social. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that a moderate influence of westerly winds is currently observed across Nepal. The division said that a westerly low-pressure system is expected to impact Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces from this evening. At present, hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali provinces are experiencing partly cloudy conditions, while the weather remains mostly clear in other regions. Fog and mist are affecting parts of the Tarai and hilly areas. Light rainfall is expected in some areas of Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces. Additionally, light snowfall is likely in parts of the high hills and mountainous regions of Koshi province, and in several locations within the high-altitude areas of Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces. The division has cautioned about foggy conditions in parts of the Tarai and Kathmandu Valley in the morning, which could momentarily impact daily life, health, agriculture, transportation, and aviation. It has urged the public to exercise necessary precautions. \nThe Madheshi Commission has expressed serious concern over the display of racial and communal behaviour during the Nepal Premier League (NPL), recommending stringent action against the unruly groups involved. Citing that disruptive groups reportedly engaged in discriminatory conduct against Janakpur Bolts’ supporters during the qualifier match between Janakpur Bolts and Karnali Yaks, the commission called for action against the people responsible for such behaviours.In its statement, the commission criticised state authorities for failing to act against the offenders, calling such inaction irresponsible. It also highlighted that while Nepal's constitution and laws advocate for equality and inclusion, discriminatory practices persist in society, hindering the nation’s progress.Meanwhile, the Chief Minister of Madhesh Province Satish Kumar Singh denounced the attack on Janakpur Bolts’ supporters as “unbearable and distressing.” He said that sports foster unity and harmony, but incidents of physical assault during the NPL final match had marred the spirit of the competition. Singh urged the authorities to act promptly and ensure those responsible face legal consequences.Moreover, the CK Raut-led Janamat Party expressed grave concern over the racial abuse and assault targeted at Madheshi community supporters of Janakpur Bolts after the final match. The party called on the government to identify and penalise the individuals involved in the incident.Similarly, Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa condemned the racial and communal behaviour, calling it deeply troubling. “Such actions cannot be justified under any circumstances,” Thapa said, demanding immediate action against the offenders. “No ifs, no buts.” \nThe Kaski District Police has officially requested Speaker Devraj Ghimire to suspend Rastriya Swatantra Party chair and Member of Parliament Rabi Lamichhane from his parliamentary position. The move follows the filing of a chargesheet against Lamichhane under the Money Laundering Prevention Act 2008 in the Kaski District Court.The charges stem from Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the Suryadarshan Cooperative fraud case. Alongside Lamichhane, 30 others, including former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, have been accused of cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering.According to Clause 27 of the Money Laundering Prevention Act, Lamichhane is subject to automatic suspension once charges are filed. This clause mandates that officials facing such charges remain suspended until the case is resolved. Speaker Ghimire is expected to make the suspension official by posting a notice on the parliamentary bulletin board, as the House session is not currently in progress.The Kaski District Court chargesheet reveals that Lamichhane and his associates allegedly embezzled over Rs2.7 billion. The charges include cooperative fraud (with penalties of 4–6 years imprisonment), organised crime (an additional 50 percent punishment), and money laundering (2–15 years imprisonment and fines double the embezzled amount).The chargesheet also implicates eight companies and several cooperatives, including Suryadarshan Cooperative, for diverting funds to ventures like Gorkha Media Network, which owned the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television. Lamichhane was reportedly a partner in the network before resigning in June 2022 to enter politics.The Kaski District Attorney’s Office has been intensifying its investigation into cooperatives fraud. A supplementary chargesheet filed earlier targeted other cooperatives and individuals, further implicating Lamichhane and his network in widespread financial irregularities.Lamichhane, who represents Chitwan’s constituency-2 in Parliament and leads the RSP parliamentary party, now faces legal and political challenges as investigations proceed. \nNepal and China signed a framework for Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation, paving the way for project negotiations with \"aid financing\" modalities including grants and low-interest loans.\nNepali officials were paid $2.5 million in bribes to seal the contract for the $209.6-million Airbus deal, the largest in Nepal’s aviation history, charging documents filed in the US court show.Deepak Sharma, a former executive of the US-based aviation services provider AAR, pleaded guilty in July earlier this year to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) anti-bribery provisions. The charges were based on allegations that Sharma was part of a conspiracy to bribe Nepali officials to secure two Airbus A330 deals in 2017.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1. \nNepal's low-growth, high-migration trap, driven by political kleptocracy and cronyism, has deepened despite emerging political agency and a growing structural crisis, creating a potential for rupture if comprehensive political and economic reforms are not implemented.\nNepal Premier League Twenty20 cricket tournament, featuring international stars and significant sponsorship, aims to propel Nepali cricket to new heights, offering a financial lifeline for domestic players and a global stage for showcasing local talent.\n[Crucial events summarized in a single line, preserving key information]\n**Concise Event Summary:** Crucial occurrences unfolded, including conflicts, diplomatic negotiations, and societal transformations.\n\nAmid the 2015 constitution promulgation and blockade, Rae, as envoy to Kathmandu, discusses Nepal-India relations, regional geopolitics, and perceptions between the countries.\nWhen I visited ‘The Mini Prints Art Fair’, hosted by Siddhartha Art Gallery, I observed a vibrant celebration of contemporary Nepali art showcasing talented artists. The exhibition features 200 intricate mini-prints using etching, woodcut, and embossing techniques.The fair offers diverse artistic interpretations with works ranging from creations such as ‘Unstable II’ by Sujita Maharjan to cultural depictions like ‘Ganapati Bappa’ by Seema Sharma Shah. Delicately crafted pieces encapsulate themes of tradition, identity, and imagination. This fair not only highlights the technical expertise of Nepali artists but also the evolving narrative of contemporary art in the region. Rustom Mody, country director of the British Council Nepal, inaugurated the event, emphasising the fair’s cultural significance. Visitors will have an immersive experience of vibrant stories told through a small-scale yet impactful medium.The exhibition, organised by Printmaking Nepal, highlights the organisation’s dedication to nurturing the art of printmaking among the younger generation. Focusing on education and creativity, the studio conducts workshops to equip aspiring artists with the skills and confidence to pursue their passions. Over the years, they have collaborated with 100 artists, blending the talents of emerging graduates and seasoned professionals. Their primary aim is to foster collaboration between new and established artists, creating a learning environment based on mentorship and experience-sharing.Uma Shankar Shah, one of the founding members of Printmaking Nepal, wants to make print art more accessible by highlighting its affordability. With prices starting from Rs3,000, Shah hopes audiences will embrace Printmaking Nepal’s message: “Art can be affordable and accessible, allowing common people to own and enjoy it without spending a fortune.”He discussed his artwork titled ‘Ramayan’, inspired by his roots in Janakpur. Having previously worked on series like ‘Roti-Beti’, he continues exploring the Maithili storytelling style, which he notes is rarely represented in art. Shah incorporates iconic imagery in his print art ‘Ramayan’, such as the main gate doors, the bow, and Sita Swayamvar. Visitors will notice a deliberate contrast in the artwork’s use of colour, with one piece being colourful and another monochrome. This distinction is achieved using natural elements, including soil, to bring depth and authenticity to the pieces. He says, “Artists face several challenges in pursuing their craft, with the lack of studio space being a primary concern. Thankfully, there are now at least ten studios in Kathmandu where they can work. Another major difficulty is sourcing materials, such as zinc plates and 20x40-inch paper, which are essential for their work. The process is also physically demanding, using acid for etching and handling heavy stones weighing 15-20 kilograms. These stones must be moved repeatedly across tables, requiring careful precision to avoid accidents, which could result in significant setbacks.”As he walked me through the exhibition, it was evident that it did not follow a central theme. He explained, “All the artists centred their work around a basic question: what can society gain from this? In this exhibition, we focus on the post-postmodernism of the 21st century—not rejecting tradition like postmodernism but delving deeper into cultural roots. As we observe in contemporary society, individuals are increasingly drawn to ancient works, whether through traditional designs in clothing or music. Our focus is on representing societal traditions in a new way.”When asked what message he had for emerging artists, he said, “As both an artist and organiser, my advice to them is that there are studios and opportunities available to showcase the work you create right after graduation. So, don’t give up on pursuing this field. Take inspiration from artists like David Basnet, who, despite being in the middle of his master’s degree, already has his artwork featured in this exhibition. Opportunities like these prove that talent and dedication can open doors, even early in your career.”Sujita Maharjan’s series of prints greets visitors, exploring themes of architectural evolution. One of her works critiques the tension between the instability of modern building designs and the rising costs of preserving traditional aesthetics. Another striking piece features a boat with a building. Her print art also incorporates intricate patterns that draw connections to Buddhism, adding a spiritual dimension to her exploration of architecture and culture.Another artist, Lokchitra, one of Nepal’s well-known traditional ‘paubha’ or ‘thangka’ artists, brings his expertise into printmaking with his work ‘Panchabuddha’. He explained, “This work reflects self-realisation, illustrating the five elements present in our bodies: air, water, fire, earth, and aether. ‘Panchabuddha’ essentially represents us, not external forms of Buddha.” In another piece titled ‘Atala’—meaning ‘unmovable’—he depicts a falchion with two blades, symbolising cutting through ignorance by understanding relative and ultimate truths. His art beautifully merges traditional symbolism with contemporary printmaking techniques.Similarly, David Basnet’s contributions include the print ‘Blooms of Thanksgiving’, inspired by the Christmas season, his gardener father, and his love for plants. The blooming cactus featured in his artwork reflects these personal connections. He explained, “Another piece, ‘Through the Bamboos’, was inspired by Nepal’s recent floods. After learning that bamboo helps prevent soil erosion, I created this artwork to highlight its environmental significance.”Basnet’s third work, ‘Old Cycle’, evokes nostalgia for his childhood memories of cycling in Kathmandu. Another of his prints depicts clock hands obstructed by vines but surrounded by blooming flowers. “Even during moments of obstruction, beauty can still emerge,” Basnet shared.Umesh Shah, primarily a painter, shared that he found printmaking interesting through the workshop. His work mainly incorporates Mithila elements inspired by Bastar Art and folk art. His piece ‘Plantation’ reflects his experience living in the Tarai region, contrasting past greenery with current deforestation. Through this, Shah urges for reforestation and better land utilisation. Another of his prints portrays the dedication and hard work of labourers, despite their insufficient wages, using tribal imagery to emphasise their resilience and struggle.Each artist brings a unique perspective, blending personal stories, cultural heritage, and social commentary._____The Mini Prints Art FairWhen: Until January 15Where: Siddhartha Art Gallery, Babermahal RevisitedTime: Sunday to Friday: 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, Saturday: 12 noon to 5 pmEntry: Free \n‘But Still, We Rise,’ performed by differently abled and LGBTQIA+ performers, highlighting marginalized women's struggles and triumphs, will be restaged with sign language interpretation and free tickets for disabled individuals.\nAs a kid, I was drawn to horror movies. Even though they were frightening, I couldn’t resist the thrill they provided. As I entered my teens, I slowly moved away from movies and began reading. I naturally gravitated toward psychological thrillers, especially those by Indian author Navoneel Chakraborty. Chakraborty’s Stranger Trilogy introduced me to this genre, and at just thirteen, I found it so terrifying that it robbed me of sleep—it felt as intense as watching horror movies.Now, in my early 20s, I still seek that same adrenaline rush. My recent read, ‘His Afflicted Mind’ by Prabigyan Aryal, was the ideal book to appease my craving. It left me wondering what would happen next, and in my search for answers, I couldn’t stop reading. The book was a mix of thrill and fear, keeping me hooked until the last page.Aryal has delved into layered childhood trauma, mental illness, and depression, dissecting these themes. How does the mind of a mentally ill individual function? How can childhood trauma affect an individual’s psyche? These are some of the questions explored in this novel. The novel’s first page contains a trigger warning. Reading it, I prepared for what lies ahead. The story starts when one of the protagonists, Aria, talks to her therapist, Dedric. Shaking uncontrollably and feeling nervous, Aria struggles to share things with her therapist. Dedric tries his best to comfort her to share, as reflected in this line: “Don’t be nervous. I am here to listen. I will respect what you have to say. Take as much time as you want.” Finding comfort in his words, Aria talks about her past. The book then continues in retrospect from December 2, 2017. This narrative technique piqued my curiosity. In the present, Aria struggles to speak to the therapist, and the author's choice of words to articulate her feelings left me wondering how she reached this place mentally.On December 2, 2017, in the fictional town of Ashvale—depicted as bleak and frigid under the grip of a harsh winter—Aria recounts her meeting with Arlo, her cherished childhood friend. She yearns for him, aching to return to their carefree days at age eleven when worries unburdened life. Through her recollection, it becomes clear that Arlo, too, struggled mentally, masking his pain behind a smile. Aria longs to be the one to make him smile, to soothe and love him. However, her yearning never materialises, plunging her into a profound sadness. Her sorrow is so overwhelming that she stands out as the saddest character I have ever read about.As readers turn a few more pages, they uncover not only the depths of Aria’s sorrow but also the severity of her deteriorating mental health. Aria hears sounds that aren’t real and sees things invisible to others. One day, after hearing strange noises, she peers outside her window and surveys the scene. Despite the thick fog, she spots a man dressed entirely in black, smiling at her. The moment she blinks, he vanishes. At first, readers might dismiss this as a fragment of her imagination. However, it becomes evident that it’s something deeper—schizophrenia, which manifests in such vivid hallucinations.Aria’s hallucinations go beyond the man in black; she also repeatedly sees a little girl outside her window—the haunting image of her dead daughter, whom she had burned alive when the child was just five years old. Her fractured mind weaves intricate delusions, using the letters ‘no’ and ‘ah’ from her parents’ names, Norbert and Hannah, to conjure an imaginary brother named Noah. Aria recounts a vivid memory of watching Noah murder her parents right before her eyes when she was a child.However, as the story unfolds, readers discover it was Aria herself who slit her parents’ throats. Her mind, unable to cope with the trauma, deceived her into believing false memories. This twist reveals that Aria suffers not only from schizophrenia but also from confabulation. In this condition, imagined scenarios are confused with real memories, leaving her unable to distinguish between the two.Hence, the book plunges readers into a shadowy, unsettling world of suspense and unease. As I read, I felt an eerie sensation. The author’s ability to evoke such emotions is commendable.What makes ‘His Afflicted Mind' especially engaging is its unpredictable nature. The narrative is slow-paced, deliberately, as it doesn’t reveal everything. Instead, the story keeps you guessing, feeding your curiosity piece by piece. Mysterious events unfold one after another, and just when you think you’ve figured things out, another twist takes you by surprise. This constant anticipation kept me glued to the book, unable to put it down. Additionally, Aryal captures the inner workings of a mentally ill mind with a raw, unfiltered authenticity. Tackling significant subjects like mental illness and childhood trauma while battling depression must have been a difficult task for Aryal. In the author’s note, he writes, “I wrote this book as a way of dealing with depression in my own life and in the hopes of getting more people to understand about what goes on in the mind of someone who is psychologically ill.” In addition, the writing style in ‘His Afflicted Mind’ is characterised by its simplicity, making it accessible to a broad audience. However, readers should be prepared to encounter a few grammatical errors throughout the book. For example, on page 105, the sentence reads, “She is more precious that life itself,” and on page 212, “I cannot to do this.” These errors disrupted the flow of the story and detracted from the emotional impact the book was striving to convey. It’s unfortunate, as more attention from the author and editor could have ensured a more polished reading experience. _____His Afflicted MindAuthor: Prabigyan Aryal Publisher: Daami Year: 2019Pages: 218 \nWith a year to go before its 15th general convention, the race for the prize of the Nepali Congress president is starting to heat up. Senior party leader Shekhar Koirala has ‘unofficially’ kicked off his campaign to win the party’s coveted post from Sudurpaschim Province, traditionally a stronghold of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba. Starting the campaign in Deuba’s heartland and getting strong support of party leaders and cadres in the region means he wants to win Deuba's support too, said a Congress leader of the Koirala camp.Koriala, who lost the party president election to Deuba at the 14th general convention in December 2021, is contesting again. The two-term limit imposed by the party charter for the top post prevents Deuba from running again. The incumbent president has so far not disclosed who he will support as his successor. Another potential candidate is General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa, who has not officially declared his candidacy but has already activated his network and mechanism to win the support of party workers across the country.Koirala on Friday interacted with party leaders and cadres of nine districts in the Sudurpaschim Province and sought their support for his bid. He and other central members interacted for six hours with local party leaders in Dhangadhi and solicited their views, Govind Raj Pokahrel, who was with Koirala, told the Post. “We had excellent interactions, following rousing welcome from the party leaders and cadres alike in Dhangadhi,” Pokharel said.“You can call it an ‘unofficial’ launch of the campaign but the focus is also on putting pressure on the party leadership to hold the 15th general convention on time,” said Pokharel. “That is the central thrust of the meetings and interactions.”But the prospect of convening the 15th general convention in December 2025 is slim as the party encounters new complications in the distribution of active membership. Only active members can elect party leaders from the ward level. Those elected ward members later vote for the party’s representatives from all 165 electoral constituencies, who in turn vote for the new party leadership. “In order to complete the local conventions on time, we sent active membership application forms to the 165 constituencies as well as party chapters abroad but no constituency has completed its task,” a Congress office bearer said. “This could push back the general convention.” The Congress has formed a task force to look into issues related to the general convention. The general convention is likely to be deferred by a year due to a number of political and technical issues, said Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada. As per the Congress charter, the party can defer the general convention by a year citing unavoidable circumstances.According to party leaders, there is a big churn happening inside the Congress, with old factions and groups either dismantled or taking new shapes in light of the upcoming general convention. For instance, former foreign minister NP Saud, a longtime aide to Deuba, joined the Koirala faction.More leaders of the Deuba camp have also joined Koirala or Thapa factions. With Deuba out of the race, there is now a competition between Koirala and Thapa to pull leaders from the Deuba camp into their folds, said a Congress central committee member.Though Deuba has kept his cards close to his chest, many Congress leaders believe General Secretary Thapa is now making inroads into the Deuba camp. The two have been getting closer after CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli became the prime minister in July. “Deuba has so far refrained from fully supporting Thapa, Koirala or any other candidate,” said Khatiwada, chair of the federal parliament’s State Affairs Committee. There is also a chance of Deuba rooting for Dr Shashanka Koirala as next party president.“I will build a Nepali Congress suitable to the times we live in after the 15th general convention,” Shekhar Koirala said in Dhangadhi on Saturday. “In order to strengthen the party, I am ready to take over its leadership.” Koirala said the focus is on holding the general convention by December 2025 as stipulated in the charter, and there should be “no ifs and buts about this”. Soon after he lost the party presidency in 2021, Koirala started campaigning for the next convention, travelling across the country, meeting party cadres and most often playing the role of the party’s “opposition” leader. Congress central working committee member Ajaya Babu Shiwakoti, who is close to Gagan Thapa, said Thapa is busy handling the mechanism formed by the ruling Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to make the government’s work effective, as well as with the party’s internal works, “which is why he appears slow in preparing for the next convention”. “But he [Thapa] is constantly in touch with party leaders and cadres across the country,” said Shiwakoti. “Also, there have been no serious talks between Koirala and Thapa on who will contest the post of party president.” Thapa contested and won the general secretary position from the Koirala camp at the last convention. While Koirala lost the top post, Thapa won with a wide margin of votes.There is a section of leaders in the Koirala-Thapa camp who still believe the two leaders should come together and contest the elections in consensus so that the camp can win a maximum number of seats in the Congress central working committee and other bodies of the party. \nThe Supreme Court has shattered yet another attempt by the CPN (Maoist Centre) to institutionalise its “people’s war”.A year after “scrapping” the decision of the erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government to announce a public holiday to mark the launch of the Maoists’ decade-long “people’s war’ in 1996, the top court has issued an order not to use ‘janayuddha’ in government documents.Issuing an interim order in a writ petition filed by Advocate Gyanendra Aran, the Constitutional Bench has directed the federal and Madhesh provincial governments not to use it until the final verdict. Aran, who also is a victim of the Maoist insurgency, had challenged the government's decision to include the term in official documents, saying it had glorified the killings and violence.The text of the ruling from last week was made public on Thursday.The national budget presented by Barshaman Pun, finance minister in the erstwhile Dahal government, on May 28 for the current fiscal year mentions “people’s war”. Similarly, the Madhesh Province’s fiscal budget for 2024-25 also mentions the term. The court says that the use of “people’s war” is against the spirit of the preamble of the Constitution of Nepal and its Article 42 (5). Instead of “people’s war”, the Article uses ‘armed conflict’ to refer to the Maoist insurgency. A five-member bench led by Chief Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut also cited how the Constitutional Committee of the Constituent Assembly on January 3, 2010, had rejected the terminology proposal.During eight years of constitution drafting, the Maoist Centre invested all its effort to put the term into the constitution. However, the former insurgents were unsuccessful as the rest of the parties stood against it. It took several sittings and days for the parties to agree that the issues which cannot be decided with consensus would be put to a vote.The “people's war” was one such contentious issue that was put to vote but was rejected by the majority. ‘Armed conflict’ has been in official use to indicate the 1996-2006 insurgency. The Maoist Centre leadership has spoken against the top court’s ruling saying that banning the term is against the democratic spirit.“I heard you [people’s war] are banned; perhaps they want to lock you in a cold cellar knowing that you are a spokesperson for social justice,” Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre’s deputy general secretary, wrote on Facebook. “A ban is a mockery of democracy. The people’s war—you have been banned.”Now the same constitutional bench will conduct final hearing on the case before passing a verdict. This is the second time in a year the top court shot down the attempt of the third largest party to institutionalise “people's war”.On December 28 last year, the Supreme Court annulled the government’s decision to declare Falgun 1 a public holiday as the ‘People's War Day’.A division bench of justices Anand Mohan Bhattarai and Mahesh Sharma Paudel had quashed the government’s decision on a public holiday while responding to a writ petition by various individuals, including Advocate Aran.The government in February 2023 had announced a public holiday to commemorate the ‘People’s War Day’ despite reservations from a coalition partner. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party then refused to attend the Cabinet meeting, expressing displeasure with the decision.The rebellion that started on February 13, 1996, concluded following a Comprehensive Peace Agreement on November 21, 2006.The Maoists, who led the insurgency, observe the first day of the Nepali month of Falgun as the People’s War Day every year. However, other political forces see the marking of the day as a public holiday as a glorification of the conflict—and hence unacceptable. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has announced that it will start random on-the-spot emission testing of vehicles on the road beginning next week.The move of the city office comes amid deteriorating air quality in Kathmandu Valley.“We have provided necessary training to two mechanical engineers, who will be deployed for emission testing,” said Jagatman Shrestha, traffic expert adviser at the metropolis. “We have also coordinated with the environment department of the federal government, traffic police, and the department of transport management to start these tests.”The city office has purchased two smoke meters (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions)—one for diesel vehicles and the other for petrol vehicles—to carry out emission testing. Officials say, for the first time, motorcycles and scooters will also be tested.Though vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of federal government agencies, the constitution also mandates local governments to take measures to reduce pollution, officials say.The metropolis has developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.Officials say these random tests will be conducted on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the department of transport management and received green stickers, as all four-wheelers on the road typically do. However, some may still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing. “We will not issue green stickers to vehicles but check emission levels,” said Shrestha. “If we find vehicles emitting pollutants more than permissible levels, we will slap a fine.”According to the officials, Rs1,000 will be fined for polluting vehicles for the first time.Random vehicle testing is among the measures the city office is taking to tackle air pollution.The municipal environment department has also started monitoring the city’s air quality independently. For that, the city office has installed portable devices in various locations. “We have already installed portable air quality monitoring devices in 16 locations within the metropolis and are preparing to install three more,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the department. “We have also launched a drive to make people aware of air pollution.”Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis.According to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air quality data from around the world, Kathmandu’s PM2.5 levels reached 197 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) on Friday afternoon.PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and get into the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.As per the Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index, when air quality reaches 151-200, it is considered unhealthy; everyone may experience problems, with sensitive groups feeling more severe effects.Major hospitals report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Meanwhile, the city office said it had installed push-button traffic lights in 36 locations for the ease of pedestrians. “We are working to bring those devices into operation soon,” said Shrestha, traffic adviser of the metropolis. “Pedestrians can push the button to stop traffic and cross the road safely.”Push-button devices are installed at traffic intersections to allow pedestrians to request stop road traffic, so that they can cross the road without fear. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nMina Karki from Dekuldanda in Ribdikot rural municipality, Palpa, has been engaged in beekeeping for 30 years. But recently, with the rising use of pesticides in commercial farming, she has been facing the problem. Bees are dying or fleeing.Most farmers are worried because honeybees are crucial to the food supply, pollinating over 100 crops. Reports say that three-fourths of the world's flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world's food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. Karki, who has been doing beekeeping with the support of her husband, has more than 25 hives. She earns Rs60,000 annually and is motivated to earn while staying at home.“But dying bees have troubled many people like me,” said Karki. “I’ve been in the beekeeping business for three decades. This problem was rare.”Hom Bahadur Bhattarai of Bhairavsthan of Ribdikot has at least 35 hives. He has seen bees flying away. The hives have shrunk due to deaths as well.The Bhattarai couple said the problem became severe in the past couple of years. After generating a good income, Bhattarai added hives. He extracts honey three times a year. He assumed that the haphazard use of pesticides in vegetable and chilli farming has started impacting beekeeping.Nara Bahadur Palli of Jhadewa in Mathagadhi rural municipality has bee hives, around 90, on his terrace.He has been keeping traditional wooden hives for seven decades. Palli’s source of income is honey produced in the hives. But he is facing the same problems as Karki and Bhattarai.“Nobody has taken an initiative to solve the problem,” said Palli.Small investments, less hard work, and good benefits made beekeeping lucrative for many villagers. What threatens the occupation’s sustainability is that beekeepers do not receive technical and promotional support from the government. “Who will help us?” questions Palli. “I have been doing it on my own. I go to Tarai to sell the honey, and I am fine with that.”The subsidies provided by the government are gobbled up by those who are clever and have direct access to it, said Palli.Customers now reach farmers’ homes to buy honey, so there is no problem with sales. However, problems with beekeeping have only compounded.“I used to make at least Rs150,000 from honey a year. But, recently, there are no bees in half the hives,” said Palli. “Bees are disappearing. Most hives are empty. Even others have fewer bees.”Farmers are unable to stop bees from dying or fleeing. Though they have tried to retain the bees, nothing seems to be working.Farmers say long dry spells of winter, lack of bee pasture and excessive rainfall were also the reasons behind the declining bee populations.Marmara in Palpa is a good bee pasture area. Agriculture technicians said honey can be extracted three to five times in this area.Palli said that though he could save bees from other wild insects and pests, he failed to save them from dying due to the excessive use of harmful chemicals.Santosh Kumar Chaudhary, an agri expert and acting chief of the Agriculture Knowledge Centre, said that due to the impact of climate change, pests have been increasing, and farmers are applying more pesticides. “Recently, village farmers have started using pesticides on vegetables, fruits, and round chillis. But no one is aware of its direct and indirect impact.”Haphazard use of pesticides has not only made people suffer from diseases but also hugely impacted bees, Chaudhary said.The Agriculture Knowledge Center has removed subsidies for beekeepers.With the failure of the Smart Krishi Programme operated in Marmara of Jhadewa, Mathagadhi rural municipality by the Lumbini province, the government has allocated funds only for general training.Chaudhary said beekeepers had not been informed about the problem.However, according to the Agriculture Knowledge Centre, farmers’ use of pesticides for commercial farming might have impacted bees.With or without government support, farmers are earning well from beekeeping and are commercialising beekeeping at low costs.The government data shows there are more than 20,000 bee hives in Palpa. If the processing, packaging, and market management can be done with less pesticide use, farmers can be more commercial and earn more, said an agri expert. \nIn Majhthana, a remote hill station in Kaski district, Chandra Kanta Ghimire, a returnee migrant, wakes up early to cook khole (a soup of maize flour and vegetables) to feed his buffaloes. He has minimal green fodder, so he supplements their diet with a mixture of dry straw.Ghimire owns 10 Murrah buffalos. These water buffaloes originate in Haryana and Punjab, India and are mainly known for producing a high volume of milk. Until recently, he had no idea about the buffalo meat export prospects.Eleven months ago, he took another Rs2.3 million loan and added more buffaloes. “I spent Rs600,000 to erect a shed and have decided to add two buffaloes this year.”Ghimire said that a Murrah buffalo costs around Rs170,000. “I milk 50 litres a day, making a monthly income of Rs147,000 by selling it at Rs115 per litre,” said Ghimire, who dreams of buying a car with the income in four or five years. The 51-year-old farmer recently bought a washing machine. Ghimire said he hasn’t considered rearing buffalo for meat. “But I have heard it’s rewarding,” Ghimire told the Post last month. Commercial buffalo rearing for meat purposes is limited in Nepal, and the export of buffalo meat is negligible. This week, on Monday, Beijing opened a trade prospect for the meat industry, apart from traditional handicraft products, which Nepal has been exporting to its northern neighbour for decades.During Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s recent visit to China on December 2, Beijing surprised Nepal by opening its doors to water buffalo meat. On social media platforms, many users pointed out that during then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s trip to New Delhi in May, his counterpart gifted 15 Murrah buffaloes to Nepal, while Prime Minister Oli travelled to China and agreed to sell buffalo meat. But for Nepal’s ailing agricultural sector, this Chinese initiative represents a huge prospect and may significantly help the country’s graduation from least developed country (LDC). As per the statistics, if the buffalo meat export materialises, it could surpass the total export earnings from the 32 high-value goods identified by Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS), which totalled Rs110.38 billion in the last fiscal year. The trade strategy was revised last fiscal year to support Nepal’s graduation from the LDC status to a developing country by 2026.On December 16, Himalayan Food International, a private company in Nepal, and Shanghai Ziyan Food, a company in China, inked a business-to-business agreement in Kathmandu to export buffalo meat.“Immediately after the successful visit of Rt Hon PM and agreement on Buffalo meat export to China. The game-changing MOU of Strategic Cooperation for Nepal Thermally Processed Buffalo Meat Products Export Project to China is inked today, which has opened over 100 billion rupees in the buffalo farming industry in Nepal, benefitting tens of thousands of rural families. Congratulations to both our people,” Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song wrote on X.Beijing is employing soft trade diplomacy to buy $1.5 billion worth of buffalo meat from Nepal in a year, terming the project a game-changer.Experts say that’s a big opportunity for Nepal, whose annual export to China is Rs2.58 billion. The meat Beijing has sought from Nepal accounts for almost 66 percent of Nepal’s annual imports from China, which total $2.21 billion.But challenges galore.“China may offer technical help to build a processing facility for this purpose,” said Mahanand Joshi, a senior agri-economist at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. “A Nepali private company will export $1.5 billion of buffalo meat annually, depending on Nepal’s production. The government will invest to increase buffalo production accordingly.” “To meet the target of $1.5 billion, we need to meet the technical standard for export, and work will be expedited for this purpose.”However, Nepal’s present buffalo population can’t even meet the high domestic market demands, and insiders say buffalos are brought in large numbers from India.The buffalo meat industry of Nepal is still experiencing a market gap due to the demand-supply mismatch. The Beijing initiative opens new opportunities for entrepreneurs to fill the gap.The total meat production in Nepal peaked at 552,156 tonnes in 2019-20 due to the Covid pandemic, when people started to take an extra protein diet to fight the virus.However, production gradually dropped to 520,742 tonnes in 2020-21 and 512,788 tonnes in 2021-22. The production fell sharply to 430,085 tonnes in 2022-23, which experts attributed to an exodus of Nepali youth, the key population who loved eating meat. Government statistics show that labour permits and student visas were issued for nearly a million Nepalis in 2022-23. Buffalo meat, which represents 27 percent of total meat production in Nepal and has 20.23 grams of protein content per 100 grams, higher than other types of meat, rose to 189,517 tonnes in 2019-20. Production fell to 188,172 tonnes in 2020-21 and peaked at a time high of 194,090 tonnes in 2021-22. The output then shrank to a nearly two-and-a-half-decade low of 116,503 tonnes in 2022-23.The population of live buffalos, which was 3.70 million heads two decades ago, reached 5.30 million heads in 2018-19, the highest count. But since, the population has decreased, reaching a three-decade low of 3.08 million heads in 2022-23.Government officials see the Beijing initiative as a game changer for Nepal’s livestock sector.Sudhir Kumar Singh, information officer at the Department of Livestock Services, believes Nepal can meet the Chinese demand.“As demand for buffalo meat has declined, farmers too were discouraged. But if there is a trade prospect, commercial farming may thrive again.”Livestock traders say it is a day-dream. “Domestic production is not enough to meet domestic demand. We estimate that nearly 70 percent of buffaloes in Nepal are imported from India illegally to meet the buff demand,” said Jiban Khatiwada, president of the Nepal Livestock Traders Association. “In this scenario, immediately exporting buffalo meat in such a large amount is impossible.” Ghimire, the farmer in Kaski, says he didn’t import buffaloes from India. “A group of agents smuggle them. It’s not possible to bring Murrah buffalos from India legally.”Nepal has become self-reliant in goat and chicken production but not in buffalo.However, Navin Kumar Sharma, chairman of Himalayan Food International, is optimistic about the ambitious agreement. “But it will take some time.”“It is feasible to export $1.5 billion worth of buffalo meat to China by 2027-28 if we aggressively start rearing buffalo. We will start exporting 500 tonnes, as per our target. For this, we need to slaughter 5,000 buffaloes daily,” said Sharma.Chinese investors will put in Rs27 billion in two projects. Investment of Rs21 billion will be mobilised for buffalo rearing in three locations: Hariharpur Gadhi in Sindhuli, Ilam and Madi of Chitwan. Similarly, under the project, a Rs6 billion processing plant will be set up in Hariharpur Gadhi. Chinese investors are scheduled to inspect the factory in six months.“So, by the time they come, we must keep 40,000 buffalo calves. The Chinese investors have given us a target of rearing 200,000 buffalo heads in a year,” said Sharma. “We have to ensure that the buffalo meat originates in Nepal, but we will be exempted from the origin certificate for the first two years.”Sharma said he was exporting buffalo meat to Vietnam until the pre-Covid period, which then used to be re-exported to China. Buffalo is being produced primarily in Tarai areas. It takes two years for a calf to become mature for meat production.Khatiwada said people rear buffalo for milk, but as buffalo milk production is low, farmers focused on milk production have shifted to cow rearing. Also, it is comparatively easier to rear cows than buffaloes.Khatiwada said any increase in production depends on the government’s policy. “Once buffalo meat starts being exported to China, its price will rise domestically due to the push in demand. This might also encourage more farmers to start buffalo rearing,” he said.“But whatever the case, this project is undeniably ambitious.” \n\nThe cash-strapped Dairy Development Corporation has inked a pact to supply raw cheese to a private company, a move to generate cash as Nepal’s largest dairy company teeters on the edge of bankruptcy. The state-owned DDC will supply 1,000 kgs of raw cheese or whey made from 10,000 litres of milk daily to Himalayan Dog Chew, owned by Manaram Group, a key exporter of the hardened cheese.Whey is the liquid remaining after milk has been curdled and strained. It is used to make Chhurpi.The agreement was signed between Surya Prasad Paudel, general manager of the DDC, and Poonam Karki, chief financial officer of Manaram Group, on Wednesday. “We will supply whey for a year and renew the agreement next year,” said Paudel.Manaram Group has been exporting 100 tonnes of dog chew a month under the ‘Himalayan Dog Chew’ brand in the US market. The chew is produced in its plant in Godak, Ilam.Chhurpi, a traditional product of the highlands, is a protein-rich cheese with a smoky flavour and hard consistency that becomes chewier the longer one gnaws at it.This solid snack's uniquely challenging texture has been a favourite for decades for the people of eastern Nepal, eastern India, and Bhutan. Lately, American and Canadian pooches have grown a liking for the hard cheese made of milk, and traders can barely keep up with the demand.Paudel said the whey will be supplied from the milk collected in the DDC’s Biratnagar Milk Supply Scheme.“The consignment will begin from December 30.”DDC, the state-owned utility, has been struggling to pay dairy farmers for a long time as demand for milk has dropped sharply, which market insiders say was due to the price factor.The consumer price of processed milk, which was Rs76 per litre in January 2022, has reached Rs120 per litre, after a steep 58 percent rise over three years.Market analysts say that higher prices, compounded by the shrinking incomes of people, resulted in low demand for raw milk. Demand for other dairy items like butter also remains subdued.“The agreement with Manaram Group will boost our cash flow,” said Paudel. The DDC still has Rs580 million in dues to farmers even after taking a loan of Rs600 million from the government.As per Wednesday’s agreement, the DDC will sell whey or raw cheese at around Rs650 per litre. The DDC currently collects raw milk from farmers at Rs65 per litre. Paudel said there will be no milk holiday in eastern Nepal, at least now, due to the agreement.He said that supplying 10,000 litres of milk to a single company, however, will not create shortages in the market.According to the DDC, the Biratnagar Milk Supply Scheme collects 15,000 litres daily. “We will now have to increase the collection gradually to 25,000 litres,” said Paudel.DDC buys 120,000 million litres of milk from farmers nationwide, worth Rs7.9 million daily, or around Rs230 million monthly.Manaram Group, the renowned exporter of dog chew, has been collecting 6,000 litres of milk from nearby districts and producing dog chew at the Ilam plant. As the collection of milk is insufficient, the group buys dog chews from small dairy farmers in Dhankuta, Sankhuwasabha, Ilam, Panchthar and Taplejung districts.The demand for dog chew has been growing in overseas markets, particularly in the US, Canada and the UK, with more and more people there owning pets.The shipment of dog chew from Nepal increased 17.6 percent to Rs1.02 billion in the first four months of the current fiscal year until mid-November, compared to the same period last fiscal, according to the Trade and Export Promotion Centre.Of the Rs1.15 billion, Rs1.02 billion worth of dog chew was exported to the United States, Rs77.29 million to Canada and Rs19.57 million to the United Kingdom. The country exported dog chews worth Rs3.18 billion in the last fiscal year.Dog chew exports have shot up by more than 240 percent in the past six years, as 90 percent of what is produced in the country is sent abroad.DDC now has Rs580 million in outstanding payments to dairy farmers.As sales did not improve in summer, the key consumption period for dairy products, on September 27, the DDC requested a loan from the government to pay the farmers.Subsequently, the Public Debt Management Office issued a loan of Rs600 million. DDC expects the dues to be cleared by mid-July.The corporation has enforced quotas to buy milk from farmers in different parts of the country.The corporation introduced a quota system for buying milk from farmers in Dhangadhi and Nepalgunj under its Milk Supply Scheme project, as the collection cost has risen. The DDC has 500 tonnes of powdered milk and 600 tonnes of butter in stock. It plans to export butter to Tibet, China, and is doing necessary paperwork. \nNepal reported another monkeypox or mpox case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the deadly disease. “Yes, samples of the suspect, who has been admitted to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, have returned positive results,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire. “We collected the samples on Thursday and got a positive report today [Friday].”Health authorities confirmed the first case of monkeypox infection in June last year.A 60-year-old foreign national had then tested positive for the infection.Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries . Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.According to health officials, the infected person, who is a migrant worker, was sent to the Dhapasi-based Grande International Hospital soon after arrival.Doctors at the hospital suspected monkeypox infection, based on the symptoms, and referred the patient to Sukraraj Hospital.“He had rashes in his private parts and blisters on hands and legs,” said a doctor at the hospital, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “The patient admitted to have had sexual contact in Saudi Arabia.”Officials at the EDCD said they will start contact tracing from Saturday.“We have to trace close contacts of the patient on the plane he travelled and the vehicle he used to go to hospitals,” said Ghimire. Public health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Monkeypox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came into widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases. \nNepal’s health authorities are mulling postponing the malaria elimination target to 2030, aligning with the World Health Organisation’s target, after efforts to contain the spread of the disease proved ineffective and it became impossible to declare the country ‘malaria-free’ by the 2026 deadline.What alarmed them most was the isolated indigenous cases that have emerged as a major challenge to eliminating the disease from the country even by 2030.“Isolated indigenous cases of malaria have become a major challenge in containing the spread of the deadly disease,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Single indigenous cases of infection have been reported from several places. We have been struggling to trace the source of infection.”Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes carry these deadly parasites, according to the World Health Organisation. Nepal had initially committed to achieving ‘malaria-free’ status by 2026. For this, the country needs to bring down indigenous cases or local transmission to zero, achieve zero deaths starting from 2023, and maintain zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.However, the country has failed to bring down indigenous cases to zero in both 2023 and 2024.Instead, cases of infections–both Indigenous and imported have risen alarmingly, which shattered any prospects of eliminating the disease within the deadline.Health officials say that only 16 cases of local transmission or indigenous cases were confirmed in 2023. But in 2024, more than 20 cases have been reported. Compared to 649 imported cases in 2023, the country witnessed nearly 1,000 such cases in 2024.Indigenous malaria cases are locally transmitted, meaning the infected person does not have a history of travel to a malaria-affected country. Officials say that the isolated indigenous cases of malaria infection are such cases that they do not have a history of travelling to the disease-endemic areas.“Neither the people of the community and family have been infected, nor the infected persons have a history of travelling to disease-hit areas,” said Dahal. “We have stepped up surveillance measures to trace the source of infection.”Officials attribute that the disease might remain asymptomatic for a long time in the infected person and emerge as single isolated cases or may have been contracted within the country in areas not considered endemic.Officials further added that open borders, budget cuts in the health sector, and mosquitoes moving to higher altitudes due to climate change have hindered Nepal’s malaria elimination goal.They say that of the total imported cases, over 80 percent came from India. Some cases were imported from African countries. Nepali security personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-hit African countries also often get tested positive for malaria.Officials say the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in Nepal unless India eradicates it first. They say that due to proximity, and an open and porous border between Nepal and India and unregulated travel of people of both countries, it is impossible to eliminate malaria in Nepal, until the disease gets eradicated in the southern neighbour.Several other factors, including cuts in the health budgets by government and aid agencies and shifts in vectors transmitting malaria to the hills and mountains due to global warming, also pose serious challenges to meeting the elimination target. Apart from this, most health facilities across the country lack entomologists necessary for conducting surveillance. Malaria-related deaths had stopped since 2016, but five years later, in 2021, the country recorded one death from the disease.Officials at the health ministry said that until recent years, Plasmodium Vivax, a protozoan parasite, had been responsible for most of the malaria cases in the country, which caused relatively less severe diseases. However, cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which most often cause severe and life-threatening malaria, have been rising. The parasite is common in many countries in Africa and the Sahara desert. \nNepal received 460,940 doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on Tuesday evening, which will be used in the nationwide vaccination drive, scheduled to start on February 5, next year.The vaccine doses are part of over 1.7 million doses required for the first phase of the campaign, health officials say.“We received the first tranche of HPV vaccine doses,” said Om Prasad Upadhyay, an immunisation supervisor officer at the Department of Health Services. “Remaining doses will arrive before the start of the vaccination campaign.”Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact and is a major cause of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women as well. It is estimated that hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer in Nepal every year.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Experts say early treatment can prevent up to 80 percent of cervical cancer cases.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced HPV vaccines nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced them in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccines in Chitwan and Kaski districts. During the pilot, all girls aged between 11 and 13 years were given two doses of the vaccine.Last year, the country purchased 20,000 doses of the HPV vaccine and administered it to around 9,000 girls aged between 14 and 15 years in all seven provinces. Health authorities administered the vaccines at schools after other measures failed to increase the vaccine’s uptake.Doctors say most cases of cervical cancer are linked to HPV, and widespread immunisation could significantly reduce the impact of cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers worldwide.The Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to launch a nationwide HPV vaccination drive from February 5 next year.During the nationwide campaign, over 1.68 million girls between 10 and 14 years will be administered the HPV vaccine. Two doses of vaccine will be administered within a 12-month period. The Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has committed to supply the vaccine doses required for the campaign free of cost along with the campaign’s operation cost, officials say. The government has decided to include the HPV vaccine in the routine immunisation list following the compilation of the nationwide drive.It is estimated that there are around 350,000 girls aged 10 years who will be inoculated with the HPV vaccine.Nepal has to cover a certain percentage of the cost of the vaccine once it is included in the regular immunisation list, officials say.The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus. \nA few days ago, a five-year-old boy from Kathmandu was rushed to the emergency ward of the Kanti Children's Hospital for a respiratory illness. Doctors said the boy had been suffering from an acute lower tract infection, decreased lung function, and asthma.“Respiratory viruses, including influenza and others, become more active during the winter season,” said Dr Sumit Agrawal, the hospital spokesperson. “The rise in the air pollution levels has further exacerbated the problems.”This has become a common refrain among the hundreds of children suffering from respiratory illness, as the air quality in the country continues to decline.Doctors say respiratory viruses—influenza A(H1N1), A(H3), influenza B, rhinovirus, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses, among others—are generally more active during winter. But what alarmed them is that studies show children in Kathmandu Valley are highly exposed to air pollution, which could worsen respiratory and other problems.A recent study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council shows that children in Kathmandu Valley have been highly exposed to air pollution.“They are exposed to air pollution while commuting to and from school,” said Dr Megnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Council. “Those travelling by scooter to and from school are at risk even more.”According to the report, KN95 masks block 50 to 70 percent of pollution particles, but most children do not wear these masks. Parents, too, are often not aware of the risks. Moreover, children do not know how to wear face masks properly.With the start of the dry season, air quality, mostly in highly dense cities, including the Kathmandu Valley, has been worsening. IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air-quality data from around the world, has ranked Kathmandu among the world’s 10 most polluted cities several times in recent days. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and even the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and are also likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.Doctors say poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run, it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.“The increase in the sale of inhalers and nebulisers for children is also a clear sign of how serious the problem has become,” said Dr Ganesh Rai, former director at the Kanti Children Hospital. “The number of cases of respiratory illness in children has risen by 50 percent in the last 10 years and 100 percent in 20 years.”Studies show people in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by polluted air, which is responsible for more than 90 percent of deaths in these countries, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal also showed that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.Past studies also show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Public health measures—mask-wearing, handwashing, avoiding crowds, and maintaining social distancing—can reduce infection, according to doctors. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has imposed a fine of Rs200,000 on Bhatbhateni Supermarket in Tripureshwar for selling substandard products. The Department of Agriculture and Livestock, under KMC, found mold in packaged food items during an inspection prompted by customer complaints.Dr Awadhesh Jha, an inspection officer from the department, stated that the KMC call centre received complaints alleging the sale of “expired, rotten, and pest-infested food” at the store. Following the inspection, 44 packets of coconuts were found to contain mold, leading to their destruction on Friday and the subsequent fine imposed on the supermarket.In an official statement, KMC emphasised the importance of adhering to food safety regulations, saying, “The penalty amount must be deposited into the city’s revenue account. Moving forward, ensure that all items sold comply with Nepal’s laws and maintain high-quality standards fit for consumption.” \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nNepal played out a 1-1 draw against Bhutan in a Women’s U-19 international friendly held on Sunday at the Dasharath Stadium.Sushila KC opened the scoring for Nepal with a brilliant strike from outside the penalty area in the 47th minute. However, this goal did not prove decisive, as Bhutan’s Phuntsho Choden equalised in the 80th minute.The match also featured a crucial defensive effort by Nepal’s defender Simran Rai, who made a spectacular goal-line clearance with a header in the 20th minute, denying Bhutan’s Choki Om from scoring. Apart from this, both teams failed to create significant attacking opportunities in the first half.In their previous Women’s U-16 friendly, Bhutan had defeated Nepal 5-1. \n\nJanakpur Bolts’ Lahiru Milantha emerged as the leading run-scorer of the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) cricket season. His remarkable 87-run knock in the final against Sudurpaschim Royals propelled him to the top of the charts, surpassing Ravi Bopara, Rohit Paudel, and others.Before the final, Chitwan Rhinos’ Ravi Bopara led with 286 runs, followed by Lumbini Lions’ skipper Rohit Paudel with 279. Milantha, who had accumulated 206 runs before the final, surged ahead to 293 after his match-winning innings off 49 balls. He also maintained an impressive strike rate above 130 throughout the tournament.Milantha’s NPL campaign included a standout performance of 75 not out off 53 balls in the tournament opener against Biratnagar Kings.Meanwhile, Janakpur’s Lalit Rajbanshi and Sudurpaschim’s Scott Kuggeleijn tied as the season’s highest wicket-takers, both claiming 17 scalps. Rajbanshi’s disciplined bowling was pivotal in Janakpur’s victory. He bowled a maiden over early in the final and dismissed Sudurpaschim’s key batter, Binod Bhandari, for 41 runs. Rajbanshi ended the match with figures of 1 for 15 in 4 overs, including a maiden.In contrast, Kuggeleijn struggled in the final, conceding 28 runs in his first two overs. He managed to dismiss Milantha in the 17th over but gave away 15 runs in the same over, including wides and boundaries.Despite Kuggeleijn’s lower economy, his average of 12.35 in 9 matches edged Rajbanshi’s 12.52 in 10 matches. Other standout bowlers of the season included Chitwan’s Sohail Tanvir and Janakpur’s Kishore Mahato (14 wickets each) and Sudurpaschim’s Saif Zaib (12 wickets).Milantha and Rajbanshi’s contributions were instrumental in Janakpur Bolts’ successful NPL campaign, making them the standout players of the season. \nJanakpur Bolts clinched the Nepal Premier League (NPL) cricket title with a spectacular five-wicket win over Sudurpaschim Royals, thanks to Lahiru Milantha’s stunning batting performance. Milantha’s 87 off 49 balls led Janakpur to chase down a challenging 185-run target with four balls to spare at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Saturday.Janakpur got off to a flying start, adding 71 runs in the powerplay and 105 runs in the first 10 overs. Milantha, who completed his half-century in just 31 balls, was dropped on 65 when Sudurpaschim captain Dipendra Singh Airee missed a caught-and-bowled opportunity. Milantha’s innings included 9 fours and 4 sixes.Opener Aasif Sheikh contributed 33 runs off 19 balls, featuring 4 fours and 2 sixes, setting a solid foundation for Janakpur. Lower-order contributions from Harsh Thaker (30 off 24 balls) and Mayank Yadav (2 not out) sealed the victory. Sudurpaschim’s bowlers struggled, with Airee conceding 40 runs for a wicket in his 4 overs, while Saif Zaib, Ishan Pandey, and Scott Kuggeleijn took one wicket each.Earlier, Sudurpaschim posted 184 runs after electing to bat first. Opener Saif Zaib scored a brisk 69 off 43 balls, and Binod Bhandari added 41 off 31 balls, sharing a 117-run stand for the first wicket. Janakpur’s Kishore Mahato (3/25) and Mohammad Mohsin (3/40) led the bowling attack, restricting Sudurpaschim’s middle order.Janakpur’s triumph marked a comeback, as Sudurpaschim had defeated them twice earlier in the tournament. With this win, Janakpur Bolts emerged as the champions of the NPL, showcasing resilience and brilliant teamwork in the final. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Saturday accused Panama of charging excessive rates for use of the Panama Canal and said that if Panama did not manage the canal in an acceptable fashion, he would demand the US ally hand it over.In an evening post on Truth Social, Trump also warned he would not let the canal fall into the “wrong hands,” and he seemed to warn of potential Chinese influence on the passage, writing the canal should not be managed by China.The post was an exceedingly rare example of a US leader saying he could push a sovereign country to hand over territory. It also underlines an expected shift in US diplomacy under Trump, who has not historically shied away from threatening allies and using bellicose rhetoric when dealing with counterparts.The United States largely built the canal and administrated territory surrounding the passage for decades. But the US government fully handed control of the canal to Panama in 1999 after a period of joint administration.“The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, especially knowing the extraordinary generosity that has been bestowed to Panama by the US,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.“It was not given for the benefit of others, but merely as a token of cooperation with us and Panama. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question.” \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nPakistan is currently the world’s fifth most populous country. The majority of the population consists of youth between the ages of 18 to 30. The youth are our future, our most valuable assets; in their hands will soon lie the reins of the nation. However, we see that they are facing tremendous problems in finding a direction in life. They need guidance, help, and role models.It is the parents’ prime responsibility to guide their children on the way to success. It is necessary for parents to inculcate sound ethics in the younger generation so that they refrain from waywardness.Adolescence is a particularly important phase of life. It is a unique stage for laying the foundations for the future edifice of life. Adolescents experience rapid physical and cognitive growth. This affects how they feel, think, share, make decisions, and interact with the world around them.Though every young person is different from the other, and each builds his or her life according to their own individual experiences, they all share some basic traits. For example, they want to be attractive, energetic and passionate in their peer circle. They adopt new fashions and hairstyles, flaunt new clothes, and dream about achieving certain goals. With each passing day, they become more and more independent about the things they like, how to get around and where to go, how to spend time and how to spend money.The youth are required to understand the nature of life.As they become more independent, there come some changes in family routines and relationships, as well as their friendships. It is a period where they develop their own perceptions about the world. This creates a gap between parents’ thinking and that of their offspring. Many youths resort to throwing tantrums over trivial matters. In many cases, parents lose their influence over youths, but it is necessary that they keep an eye on their behaviour and try to reduce the gap between them.It is also a precarious stage where youths can be misled and adopt negative habits like smoking, or take to drug addiction. Therefore, they need special attention and constant encouragement to stay away from social evils.Normally, youths seem to be ambitious. Therefore, they should be encouraged to explore new opportunities and keep pace with the changing world. Parents may try to convince them that they should not rely on shortcuts for fame and success but work hard and embrace challenges so they may achieve success through struggle. In any field they choose, they should not simply chase grades but acquire real knowledge. Here, parents should try to instill in them a strong sense of commitment.Of late, the use of social media amongst the youth has increased manifold. Consequently, this has increased parents’ responsibilities significantly. There is a lot of fake content on various social media platforms. It is, therefore, the parents’ responsibility to protect the youth from the adverse effects of fake content. They have to balance screen time with physical activities to promote a healthy digital lifestyle. Monitoring should be coupled with open conversations and setting limits.The youth are required to understand the nature of life. Life is tough and competitive; it is not a bed of roses, nor is it full of thorns. It is full of ups and downs. It’s like an endless ocean. We are sailing in a boat and want to touch the shore. We must stay determined and try our best to reach our destination. If we quit making an effort, we will never get what we want and those who get what they want, will never stop trying for it.Islam places great emphasis on the role of youth in shaping a prosperous future, recognising their po­­tential for development and efficiency. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) in his wisdom, is said to have advised youngsters to make the most of their youth, health, wealth, free time, and life itself. According to a hadith, the Prophet said: “Take advantage of five before five: your youth before your old age, your health before your illness, your riches before your poverty, your free time before your work, and your life before your death.” This guidance aligns with modern scientific understanding, which acknowledges the vitality and innovation of young minds.The Holy Quran mentions the story of the People of the Cave (Ashab-i-kahf) — a group of devout youth who sought Allah’s help at the time of difficulties. They wanted to escape religious persecution; this is an example for all youths of how to surmount difficulties in life. The youth are facing major challenges today. They have to struggle and remain steadfast in their faith, for struggle itself is the meaning of life and there is no escape.Dawn (Pakistan) / ANN \nEarlier this week, Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chair KP Sharma Oli completed five months in office. His tango with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba seems to be proceeding well. Over the last few months, the top leaders of Nepal’s two major political parties have been excessively focused on not offending each other, as doing so could tip the balance.Since this new coalition was formed without a clear vision, it failed to inspire confidence from the outset. Hence, on the delivery front, the Oli administration was bound to fail.The CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress decided to join forces with the promise of amending the constitution to ensure political stability. Over the past months, the two parties have offered numerous reasons for forming the coalition, but none involve the constitutional amendment issue, as if it has vanished from their agenda.Neither party has provided answers about the amendment process, likely because they don’t have one.While an amendment to the constitution is not inherently problematic, there must be a clear rationale. The justification the two parties offered was so flimsy that it was evident from the start that their amendment rhetoric was just a ruse. Even if they are committed to their promise, it remains a misguided priority. The need of the hour is addressing more urgent matters, such as good governance and service delivery, which are directly linked to citizens.Misplaced priorityNepal’s major political parties—the NC, the UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—seem to have little confidence in the constitution they once championed through majoritarian dominance. Dissenting voices were ignored, suppressed and silenced.They once called it the world’s best but are now finding fault with it—not because it has caused problems for the people but because it obstructs their pursuit of majority governments. At least, this has been the argument of the UML and the Congress of late because they are the largest parties and are aiming for a majority in the next elections. Nevertheless, once promulgated, it was incumbent upon Nepali parties to focus on full implementation of the constitution. This required following due processes—enacting laws, devolving power and strengthening institutions. However, none of the parties paid attention to these fundamentals. Instead, they treated the constitution as a tool to “rule” when the charter required them to “govern.”Post-2015, Nepali parties had only two key responsibilities—governance and constitution implementation. They failed on both fronts, especially because they were excessively involved in the game of one-upmanship. These key duties were thus relegated to the back burner.Spirit of the constitutionA pluralist, inclusive, progressive and peaceful society was the core idea of the constitution. But this very spirit is under threat from the parties that are supposed to safeguard it, as they have failed to internalise the concept of constitutionalism in its true sense.Nepali politicians often cite the holding of two sets of national, provincial and local elections within the prescribed timeframe and the formation of governments to argue that democracy is functioning in Nepal. While this reasoning has merit, democracy’s full functionality depends on its realisation at the grassroots and among the people.True upholding of constitutionalism means abiding by its principles, respecting its limitations and adhering to the rule of law. Only then can the pluralistic, inclusive and progressive society envisioned by the constitution be built.Stable and accountable governance entails adherence to the rule of law, the protection of individual rights and the separation of powers.But questions remain: Have successive governments, regardless of which parties or leaders led them, fully complied with the laws? Has the system of checks and balances been allowed to operate fully in both letter and spirit?Constitutional moralityTrue implementation of the constitution depends on constitutionalism, which itself is rooted in constitutional morality—embracing not just legal provisions but also the underlying democratic values of justice, equality and respect for individual rights. Unfortunately, this idea—that the constitution is not just a guidebook setting the rules but a moral document—is sorely lacking among Nepali parties and politicians.The waning morality among Nepali parties has emerged as a troubling trend. Their pursuit of power and self-interest takes precedence over addressing citizens’ concerns. Since the UML and the Congress—historically rival parties—formed the new coalition, they have started floating the idea of a two-party system. While this notion is unlikely to materialise anytime soon, it does indicate their broader aim. Beneath the veneer of their argument for stability through a two-party system lies a dangerous intent to muzzle multi-party democracy, one of the basic tenets of the constitution, and to rule in turns.Coupled with this is yet another worrying concern: Internal democracy has been on the wane within Nepali political parties. Majoritarianism rules the roost in major parties, raising the risk that the same approach will manifest when they come to power. Democracy thrives when institutions are strong, but they have been weakened by the parties’ disregard for the separation of powers. Weak institutions, a lack of morality and an utter disregard for the rule of law create the perfect conditions for majoritarian tendencies to rear their ugly head.‘We, the People’The most worrying issue today is that political parties do not want to confront the most pressing issues of the day, which actually concern the people.While they harp on the constitution—and even warn that the statute is under threat—they ignore the fact that it will continue to face risks as long as they fail to ensure that the spirit of the charter resonates with ordinary people.The worry today is not just that Nepali parties are falling short on the delivery front; it is that the gains made so far could be in danger.The incumbent UML-Congress coalition, if genuinely committed to the welfare of ordinary citizens, must pause and reassess its priorities. Their survival and political relevance depend on embracing the politics of citizenry and addressing the pressing needs of the people they are meant to serve.Lest they forget, the ultimate power rests with “We, the People,” as the constitution declares. \nLong gone are the smog-free winter days. As soon as the temperatures dip, the bowl-shaped topography of Kathmandu Valley traps pollutants in the atmosphere, making its air one of the most toxic in the world. The problem is not limited to the federal capital and its periphery though, as other cities and districts in the country also fare poorly in this regard. All of Nepal’s 30.7 million people now live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline of 5 micrograms per cubic metre. This has cut the life expectancy of Nepalis by nearly five years, as reported by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) issued by the Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago.Though illegal, the practices of stubble burning in the fields, and open-waste or plastic burning in the backyards of houses, street corners and even public spaces, are widespread. Moreover, construction works on roads and sidewalks that linger for months or years result in much dust and dirt, while contractors often show little urgency to meet the deadlines. Little do people consider that their small part, when extrapolated across a large population, is making the air unbreathable and destroying their health. The systemic neglect of authorities is also exacerbating the air pollution crisis.Breathing in unhealthy air has multiple health consequences. Health workers warn that exposure to foul air can in the short term lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke and heart problems. Over time, it can cause severe conditions such as ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases and heart complications. Since the start of the dry season this year, hospitals in the Valley have witnessed a steady rise in the number of patients—mostly children and elderly—with respiratory illnesses. A recent Nepal Health Research Council study shows that children in Kathmandu Valley are particularly vulnerable to air pollution due to their exposure while commuting to and from schools. In response, the Ministry of Forests and Environment has recently asked people to focus on maintaining their vehicles, using clean energy, controlling smoke and dust coming from roads and construction work, and refraining from burning plastic. But such directives are more often ignored than they are heeded, by both the public and authorities. While sprinkling water on roads and sweeping the dust can keep our surroundings clean, these activities are no solutions to the problem of air pollution. Worryingly, promoting clean energy, including in our kitchens, doesn’t seem to be a priority of our political leaders and authorities. Experts also often point to lack of coordination between different agencies to tackle air pollution. We thus need a complete overhaul of the way we manage air pollution. Lasting solutions will emerge only through greater collaboration, for instance, between the local units, and the ministries of transport, health and population and urban development. Local authorities can control open burning through stringent rules and monitoring; the transport ministry too could get serious about phasing out old vehicles that emit pollutants. While pollution from cities in northern India has also been identified as a contributor to poor air quality in Nepali border towns and the capital city of Kathmandu, perhaps the locally generated pollutants are an even bigger threat. If we fail to do our bit to clean our own air, we also lose the moral ground to point fingers at other countries. With the right policies, programmes and mindset, the air we breathe would be a lot healthier.  \nCorruption ails almost every sector in Nepal. It is believed to be one major factor discouraging investors, innovators, entrepreneurs, as well as service seekers. But following tremendous pressure from various sections of the society, government authorities have initiated investigations on some major corruption cases. The fake Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Tribhuvan University land encroachment, gold smuggling and cooperatives deposits embezzlement are cases that have been probed. Even high profile personalities such as a former Speaker, former ministers, top bureaucrats and powerful middlemen have been prosecuted.Currently, the embezzlement of billions of rupees deposited by thousands of people at hundreds of cooperatives across the country remains a hotly-debated issue. Politicians, a former top police official, and key officials running dozens of cooperatives are being investigated. Police have issued red corner notices against those who are on the run after embezzling deposits from various cooperatives. The Rastriya Swatantra Party chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, among other suspects, has been in custody for the past two months over his alleged involvement in the embezzlement. But other politicians and individuals close to top political leaders have been spared, it is alleged, under political pressure. Just like Lamichhane, Nepali Congress Vice-President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung, and federal parliament’s Public Accounts Committee chair Rishikesh Pokharel of the CPN-UML have been linked to the cases of embezzlement of funds from different cooperatives. Yet they were not being probed. Thankfully, there has been a breakthrough. The Morang District Court on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant against 25 suspects including Anjala Koirala, wife of PAC chair Pokharel, in connection with alleged financial irregularities in Uma-Gauri Agricultural Cooperative. Yet little seems to be happening in the case against Gurung. The Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police had in October recommended the police headquarter issue a red notice against Gurung’s former wife Jyoti, among others, on charges of embezzling cooperative deposits. Though Dhan Raj and Jyoti officially appear to have divorced, it seems the two were still jointly misusing funds even after the formal divorce. Also, the cross-party Parliamentary Special Probe Committee has suggested the authorities investigate the Congress leader’s involvement.When it comes to past investigations in major corruption scandals, the results have been mixed. The investigation agencies have produced some laudable results in a few cases, while they were criticised in other scams for sparing politicians while punishing civil servants and other individuals. So people still doubt their role. Many people believe investigating agencies, under pressure from influential leaders, first spare the politicians and their kin or, even if they are arrested, the cases against them are watered down to help the suspects get clean chit. Though cases were filed against high profile individuals in the fake refugee case, Lalita Niwas and gold smuggling scams, many of them have already been acquitted. People are thus rightly suspicious. To remove their doubts, first, the agencies should show the courage to work independently and stop waiting for signals from top politicians. Or the flawed justice process will backfire on the top politicians too. If the public comes to see that only those without access to power centres get punished while those close to top politicians and other power centres are spared, their faith in the country’s legal process will erode. So will their trust in the political parties. Now that investigation has started against the spouse of an UML leader, there should now be no delay in probing the Congress leader too.   \nFor years, politics has taken precedence over progress in Nepal’s higher education. Political parties have turned educational institutions into their playgrounds, weakening the foundation and values of these establishments. This is evident in the recent hullabaloo over the appointment of deans at Tribhuvan University (TU), Nepal’s oldest. The dean positions were vacant since June this year, and disagreements in the executive council over the selections had hindered the selection process before Dashain. The major political parties and their student unions did their best to manipulate the merit-based appointment system, while criticising each other for ‘politicising’ higher education. The tug-of-war between the parties finally ended with the appointment of deans in five study institutes and three faculties of the university. However, these appointments have once again laid bare the practice of bhagbanda between the CPN-UML, the Nepali Congress, and the CPN (Maoist Centre).For fair selection, the executive council issued procedures for appointing deans and formed recommendation committees to suggest candidates based on merit. However, these committees have no more than symbolic value in a country where corruption seeps into the very systems intended to eradicate it. When vice-chancellor Keshar Jung Baral tried to appoint the deans and campus chiefs based on “meritocracy”, the recommendation committee did not rank professors affiliated with the UML on top. This did not please the UML and Baral was criticised at the University’s senate meeting. Although the UML’s protest reflects its vested interests, Baral’s claim of merit-based dean recommendation is contaminated by his own controversial past, raising doubts over his intent. In February, then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had appointed Baral as vice-chancellor even though he was second in line after Chitra Bahadur Budhathoki.To sum up, meritocracy was seen only on paper, as wherever there was political interest, selections weren’t based on merit. Ultimately this time, three Congress-affiliated professors, and two each from the UML and the Maoist Centre, were appointed deans, in addition to one with no clear political ties. It is now well established that politicisation of higher education does a lot of harm. Once renowned for its academic excellence, India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University has devolved into a hotspot for political unrest, with strikes and protests harming its academic standing. Similarly, Karachi University in Pakistan has suffered a lot from political polarisation, resulting in on-campus violence and administrative blunders.The logic is straightforward: Those who have mastered academia are best equipped to understand and manage educational institutions. However, such reasoning does not work in Tribhuvan University, where the chancellor, the highest-ranking official in the university, is the prime minister. Although the universities’ laws authorise the prime minister, as an ex-officio chancellor, to appoint vice-chancellors from among the three names recommended by the search committees, the prime minister typically appoints individuals aligned with their party, triggering a domino effect that ultimately undermines the merit-based system. Such unnatural appointments to major positions in educational institutions in turn disrupt the university’s intellectual ecosystem. It is high time we got to the root of politicisation of education and nipped it in the bud. The political parties cannot be allowed to use educational institutions as an extension of party organisations and risk the future of hundreds of thousands of students. At a time when we are witnessing a mass exodus of students due to their increasing distrust in our higher education, political parties must step aside and allow those who understand the institutions the best to lead. It is about time we created an education system that works for the benefit of students rather than politicians. \nEvery year, the Everest region, one of Nepal’s major tourist hubs, draws thousands of mountaineers, trekkers, and high-end (luxury) tourists from the world over. Helicopter sightseeing, which is as popular as trekking and mountain climbing, caters to tourists willing to spend generously to get a close glimpse of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. Such sightseeing adventures also significantly benefit hotels, airlines, local businesses and the country’s overall economy. However, starting January 1, 2025, the Sagarmatha National Park has decided to impose a blanket ban on helicopter sightseeing tours in the region. This has sparked an acrimonious debate among stakeholders.This seemingly lucrative tourism practice has a darker side. While helicopters support tourism in the national park and surrounding region, they are harmful to the wild animals living in the park’s relatively undisturbed areas. According to official data, there are over 6,000 chopper flights in the Everest region during spring and autumn—the peak tourist seasons. These flights cause excessive noise pollution and disrupt the wildlife’s feeding and breeding patterns. Low-flying helicopters are particularly dangerous to the Himalayan Tahr and Himalayan Goral. According to park sources, some animals are dying by jumping off the cliffs due to the abrupt, loud noises of the choppers. Others are fleeing their natural habitats and straying into nearby villages where they pose challenges to local communities. Thus the park’s concern about wildlife is understandable. It is also home to the world’s rarest species, including snow leopards and red pandas. The protection of these animals cannot be overlooked as it helps maintain biodiversity and contributes to wildlife tourism. According to park officials, other reasons, including haphazard landing of the copters and suspicion of transport of wildlife contraband also prompted them to take such an action. However, the abrupt and arbitrary manner in which the ban was imposed is concerning as it will affect the region’s tourism. Tour operators, helicopter companies, as well as the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the country’s civil aviation regulator, have criticised the ban made without consultations and exploration of alternatives. The CAAN has also clarified that the park has no legal basis to enforce such a ban.Nepal’s tourism sector is still in the post-Covid recovery phase. To make things worse, the European Union has extended its ban on Nepali airlines. Entrepreneurs who have invested in tourism are still suffering big losses. At this juncture, high-end tourism products like helicopter sightseeing could be a lifesaver for the ailing industry. So rather than blaming each other, the park and civil aviation authorities should try to find common ground and opt for a more balanced approach. As experts have suggested, establishing designated flight corridors away from sensitive wildlife habitats or conservation areas could be a viable solution to cut noise pollution. If concerns of the national park authority related to contraband and haphazard landings are genuine, monitoring activities in the region should be strengthened, and the aviation watchdog should hold the operators involved accountable. Wildlife and tourism are lifelines of our economy and there is a need to maintain a calibrated balance between the two. We believe, with a little more thought, a way can be worked out for them to coexist.  \nIt has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nChina-Nepal relations are stable, with China emphasizing non-intervention and encouraging mutual respect and economic cooperation. China anticipates Nepal's potential as a hub for trade between China and India, while denying interference in Nepal's internal affairs through party-to-party engagement, which it claims is based on mutual understanding and respect for sovereignty. Prime Minister Oli's upcoming visit to China is expected to further enhance bilateral cooperation and political trust.\nFormer Indian Chief Election Commissioner SY Quraishi emphasizes the importance of credible elections for democracy, discusses the challenges posed by money in politics, and raises concerns about the increasing influence of social media and artificial intelligence on electoral processes.\nA mild westerly disturbance brings partial cloud cover to some provinces and fog to Tarai and Valleys, potentially impacting various sectors.\nA weak westerly disturbance brings partly cloudy skies, light rain, and snowfall to Nepal's Koshi Province, while fog in Tarai regions prompts caution.\nWesterly winds are causing partial cloudiness in hilly and mountainous regions, with potential light snowfall in Gandaki Province's mountains.\nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that the country is currently experiencing the influence of a westerly wind, resulting in predominantly clear weather across most regions. According to the Division, Sunday will see mainly clear skies nationwide during the day and night. However, some parts of the Terai are experiencing mist or fog in the morning, which may cause temporary disruptions to daily life, transportation, and aviation. Residents of the high hills and Himalayan regions in Gandaki Province, Karnali Province, and Sudurpaschim Province have been advised to prepare for possible light snowfall over the coming days. \n\nBe elaborative as possible.
