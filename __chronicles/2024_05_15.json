Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPresident Ramchandra Paudel on Tuesday presented the government’s policies and programmes which incorporated many old programmes. The ruling alliance called the document a departure from norm while opposition parties said that there is nothing new in the document and so further discussion in Parliament is unnecessary.The 55-page document that set the priorities of the government also offered some new propositions which the opposition parties labelled ‘vague’ and ‘incomplete’. Paudel in his address said implementing the constitution, shoring up federalism and economy, and controlling corruption are the government's major priorities. The document also states that the scope of social welfare schemes will be expanded, 5,000 new jobs created in the information and technology sector, startup loans will be extended to 1,000 youths and installed capacity of hydropower projects in the country will be increased from the existing 2,940 megawatt to 4,500 megawatt. The government also invoked the slogan of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali” (Samriddha Nepal, Sukhi Nepali), the CPN-UML’s flagship initiative, in the policies and programmes. “There is no need to discuss the document,” said Nepali Congress spokesman and former finance minister Prakash Sharan Mahat. “There is nothing new here.”But the ruling parties praised the document and claimed that it lays the platform for an economic march. “Compared to the previous policies and programmes, today’s document has some new features,” said Swarnim Wagle, a parliamentarian from the Rastriya Swatantra Party. Wagle is a noted economist who earlier served as the vice-chairman of the National Planning Commission.The government has emphasised promotion of good governance, streamlining public services, and establishing a citizen-friendly governance system, said Paudel, while announcing 2024-2034 as a decade devoted to promoting agriculture. He said the investment of public, private, cooperatives and development sectors in the agricultural sector will be increased. He also announced that programmes in agriculture will be restructured so as to make the country self-sufficient, mainly in food and vegetables.In his speech, the President said the government is committed to attracting private capital and bringing foreign investment. The government will work towards boosting the morale of industrialists and businesspersons, the President said.As the country is grappling with an unprecedented cooperatives crisis, the government has proposed setting up a powerful tribunal as well as an effective loan recovery mechanism and a regulatory body to oversee the sector.“The document does not address the concerns and grievances of the people and issues raised by the opposition parties,” said Mahat, the Congress spokesperson. “The government has merely performed its duty and maintained the tradition of presenting the annual policies and programmes in Parliament.”Reading out the document, Paudel said the government will soon launch a sovereign credit rating system in order to attract foreign investment, claiming that 98 percent of the population now has access to electricity and that the export of electricity to India and Bangladesh has been assured.An agreement was reached between Nepal and India last December to export 10,000 megawatts of electricity in 10 years.There has as yet been no formal agreement between Nepal and Bangladesh to export electricity to Bangladesh using India's transmission infrastructure. But the per unit price of electricity to be exported to Bangladesh has been agreed. Paudel said special emphasis will be on building hospitals in local units. In 2021, the then KP Sharma Oli-led government had also announced plans to build at least one hospital in every local unit and initiated the process to construct 396 hospitals. Progress on most of them, however, is dismal. Paudel said that health insurance has been extended to all local governments.Despite the widened reach of the health insurance programme, people's participation in it has not increased. Worse, those who bought the insurance scheme in the past did not renew it because of low coverage.The government aims to expedite work on national pride projects such as Sikta, Babai, Ranijmara-Kularia, Bheri-Babai and Sunkoshi-Marin diversion multi-purpose projects. An Integrated Karnali Irrigation Development Programme will be implemented in Karnali Province. Other programmes of water resource conservation are replenishment of aquifers and construction of ponds to expand irrigation schemes.“This year, unlike previous years, you will see good compatibility and correlation between the policies and programmes and the budget,” said Wagle, the parliamentarian. “This year, we are not going to talk about big things but want to bring incremental changes in several sectors.”The idea is to incorporate some new programmes and effect changes in every ministry, said Wagle. “The policies and programmes have been so designed. This is a departure from the previous policies and programmes,” he added.The government also announced the “President Climate Change Management Programme” to address the effects of climate change in the mountains, hills and the plains in an integrated manner.The document promises to implement the national policy and action plan for mitigating the effects of climate change, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction. There is a plan to establish Nepal’s leading role in internationalising the impact of climate change on the Himalayan regions, according to the document. The government has also proposed a specialised body for the supervision and regulation of credit cooperatives. It is also the government’s policy, says the document, to protect the savings and investment of the cooperative sector through the Cooperative Savings and Credit Protection Fund, the Cooperative Credit Information Centre and the Cooperative Debt Recovery Tribunal. The identification of poor households would be completed within the next financial year. The government also proposes reviving sick firms, routinely like many previous such documents. ‘The prime minister’s self-reliance programme for daughters’ has received much attention both in and outside Parliament.“From forestry to resource mobilisation to poverty reduction to irrigation, we are following the same old path,” said a government secretary, requesting anonymity. “The real challenge is improving the country’s overall economic status. Micro-level economic indicators of every household in the country are bleak, people are leaving their businesses and jobs, and are going abroad but the government’s policies and programmes do not address these woes in any way.”Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said the government has brought a good list of policies and programmes and there would be enough links between them and the national budget. Speaking to the reporters after the President presented the document, he said a new budget would be tabled in line with the document. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel delivered the government's policies and programmes on Tuesday after the Nepali Congress lifted the obstruction in the House of Representatives. However, the disruption continued afterwards.President Paudel read out the policies and programmes of the government in the joint sitting of the federal parliament.The Congress then blocked the proceedings of both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly and did not let the assembly table a motion of expressing gratitude to the President for delivering the government’s annual paper.It is customary for Parliament to thank the President for reading out the annual policies and programmes. The parliamentary party meeting of the Congress on Tuesday morning, however, had decided not to allow Parliament to proceed after the head of state wraps up his presentation.The Congress later responded that the policies and programmes fail to address the problems of cooperatives’ victims. The main opposition has been protesting in Parliament, demanding a parliamentary probe into the issue of cooperatives around the country embezzling the deposits of hundreds of thousands of depositors. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane is the focus of the largest party’s fury for his alleged involvement in the cooperative scam. “Our position that the government has protected the people who have swindled cooperatives victims has been reconfirmed,” said Ramesh Lekhak, the chief whip of the Congress party, while talking to the media after the policies and programmes had been read out.The main opposition party was initially not ready to allow the smooth operation of the Parliament’s proceedings. The party even warned the government and the ruling partners that it would prevent President Paudel from presenting the government's policies and programmes should its demand go unheeded.The Congress has been disrupting Parliament, demanding a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane over allegations of cooperative funds embezzlement. Lamichhane has publicly refuted the charges and asked for a chance to make his case clear in Parliament.But the Congress has been preventing Lamichhane from speaking in the House. The Congress, which appeared tough against the resumption of parliamentary business, even the presidential appearance, had relented and agreed to let the President present the programmes. But it resorted to the obstruction soon after. In 2017, the CPN-UML, while in the opposition, had been obstructing parliamentary proceedings. It allowed then-President Bidya Devi Bhandari to present the annual policies. The opposition then protested the Cabinet’s decision to increase the number of local federal units in the Tarai in the midst of the elections. The party later obstructed the motion of thanks to the President.During Speaker Devraj Ghimire’s meeting with the party chief whips on Tuesday afternoon, before the President read out the government’s annual document, the Congress had announced its plan to continue to disrupt the House after the policies had been presented.“We will continue to interrupt the House until our demand is addressed,” Congress whip Sushila Thing told the Post. “As there is no parliamentary practice of barring the head of state to present policies and programmes, we too didn’t go that uncharted route.”The party will not allow other proceedings of the two houses for as long as it takes in order to get its demands addressed, Thing said.On Tuesday morning, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa and the party’s Chief Whip Lekhak met Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to discuss the issue of parliamentary obstruction. Dahal had requested the Congress leaders to allow a smooth functioning of the legislature. The Congress leaders also claimed that the prime minister seemed positive about addressing their demand.“While meeting our leaders, the prime minister seemed positive but he has not taken the necessary steps to honour the call of the main opposition,” Congress whip Thing said. Dahal’s openness to the formation of the probe committee was one of the reasons the Congress became ready to allow the President to present the policies and programmes. Shakti Basnet, the minister of energy, water resources and irrigation, claimed that the discussion between the government and Congress was headed in a positive direction.“Until late Monday night, the Congress was adamant on barring the President from presenting the policies and programmes. But on Tuesday, we reached an agreement to allow the President to do so,” Basnet, a Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, told the Post. “The government will similarly reach an agreement with the Congress on its demand for the probe committee.”According to the Congress leaders, Sunday's meeting between the prime minister and Congress leaders also concluded positively to address the party's demand. After the Congress leaders met Prime Minister Dahal, the party held the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday morning. The same meeting allowed President Paudel to confer the government's annual policies and programmes. The ruling parties and the main opposition have been discussing smooth operation of Parliament for the past few days. However, given the inflexible positions of both sides, Tuesday’s session was expected to face trouble.“The ruling parties and the opposition need to come to a logical conclusion to open the parliamentary business,” UML whip Sunita Baral told the Post. “It looks like both sides only have discussed the issue at their ease. What we need is negotiation to resolve the issues of both Parliament and the cooperative scam.”The constitution mandates the government to present its annual budget on Jestha 15 (May 28 this year). For this reason also, the ruling and opposition parties need to close their ranks, Baral added.The ruling parties are ready to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the issues plaguing the cooperative sector. However, they are reluctant to constitute a committee with the mandate to probe Lamichhane. The Congress, too, is positive about a broad inquiry into the cooperatives, but it deems investigating Lamichhane in particular a necessity after various probes by police and other government bodies established his involvement in the scams. The Congress had disrupted the winter session of Parliament before it was prorogued on April 14, with the same demand. The party has also been obstructing the new session of Parliament that commenced on May 10. \nClimate change has profound impacts on Nepal's economy, water resources, biodiversity, agriculture, and awareness, affecting households, health, education, and energy transition, with significant economic losses, emergence of new crop diseases, reduced water availability, awareness gaps, and impacts on disaster vulnerability.\nRecent heavy rainfall in Nepal has brought dengue cases to 57 districts, despite efforts to mitigate its spread due to budget limitations and a lack of entomologists, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach involving multiple ministries and public cooperation.\nNepal's budget for FY2024/25 is set for release, highlighting the need to address the imbalance in fiscal transfers, with decreasing fiscal equalisation grants and a disproportionate reliance on conditional grants at the local level.\nPolitical parties have evolved from relying on volunteers to corporate entities, fostering quid pro quo relationships with corporations for funding through electoral bonds, while social media has empowered parties to manipulate public perception with lavish ad spending, necessitating re-evaluation of political funding regulation.\nSenior leaders from seven major political parties pledge to promote investment, emphasizing the need for political stability and predictability.\nEducation in Every Home's report uncovers systemic bias and inaccuracies in Nepal's textbooks, with limited diversity, underrepresentation of marginalized groups, and erroneous historical claims.\nPartly cloudy weather prevails nationwide; light rainfall possible in Koshi and Gandaki provinces, snowfall possible in Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali high-altitude regions.\nPresident Ramchandra Paudel presented the government's policies for improved economy, foreign investment, and infrastructure development, including 98% electricity access and IT hub creation.\nNepal and South Korea signed an MoU to create jobs through recycling and upcycling projects in Pokhara, with Korea contributing USD9.8 million and UNDP implementing the project to establish a green venture zone, promote sustainable enterprises, and generate green jobs.\nDrones may start transporting garbage from Mount Everest, potentially reducing the dangers faced by human guides who currently navigate the hazardous Khumbu Icefall.\nAfter nearly a decade of infertility and loss, Anistha Shrestha adopted an abandoned baby boy in 2017, filling a crucial legal gap in Nepal's adoption process but exposing ongoing issues with regulation, safety, and societal barriers faced by the queer community.\nThe victory of Suhang Nembang, a political neophyte representing the CPN-UML, in Ilam-2 by-election may not have a big impact on the make-up of the federal parliament. But it nevertheless hints at the country’s general political landscape and, of course, of the Koshi Province, where identity politics had been all the rage in the lead-up to the election.The nomenclature of Koshi Province, of which Ilam is a district, had been a flashpoint of violent agitation led by the proponents of identity politics who wanted a name that reflected the ethnic identity of the place. Two activists from that front—Milan Limbu, representing the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and independent Dakendra Singh Limbu, who was part of the Province-1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee—were in the fray. So there was curiosity on how they would perform. While the latter came in third with 11,457 votes, the former’s electoral run ended rather dismally as he could not even protect his security deposit.The votes gained by Dakendra has undercut the claims of the major parties that voices for identity-based politics in the region were weakening, argues Govinda Chhantyal, who is among the activists who opposed the nomenclature of Koshi Province.“The number of votes independent candidate Dekendra Singh Limbu garnered in Ilam-2 bypoll has established identity-politics as a major agenda in the region,” Chhantyal told the Post. “Since the 2014 election, the agenda of identity politics has been subjugated. This by-election, however, has once again established it as a political agenda.”The election result has also given the emergent Rastriya Swatantra Party a reality check, experts say. The RSP has a long way to go if it is to establish itself as a major political force throughout the country, they say, as candidates of both the ‘traditional’ political parties, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, trumped all others.The Ilam-2 House of Representatives seat went vacant after former Speaker and vice-chair of UML Subas Chandra Nembang died of a heart attack in September last year.While Suhang, the late leader’s son, won the bypoll securing 27,772 votes, his closest competitor, Dambar Bahadur Khadka, of the Nepali Congress, obtained 21,942 against Dakendra Singh’s 11,457 and Milan Limbu’s 5,050.The result shows the old parties are very much in the fray.“It seems people still see the old parties as relevant given their robust networks at the grassroots, which RSP and independent candidates lacked,” Chiran Manandhar, who was one the observers of Ilam-2 election representing the Democracy Research Center Nepal, told the Post. “People who aspire to political patronage still find old parties relevant.”The RSP had created great buzz with their vigorous campaigning for the Ilam-2 seat. Their candidate Milan Limbu and the independent Dakendra Singh had challenged the traditional parties. Given the past votes obtained by the RSP in the 2022 election and the by-elections in Chitwan-2 and Tanahun-1 a year earlier, the party was expected to challenge the established forces this time, too. But that was not to be.After the poll results, RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane took to social media to thank all the voters and urged his party supporters to accept the outcome. “Thank you everyone who voted for us and also gave us a big message,” he said.Other RSP leaders have said that there were some shortcomings of the party while contesting the Ilam-2 seat, which they would review in the upcoming central committee meeting of the party.“We heeded the signal bell, albeit belatedly,” reads the statement released by party general secretary Mukul Dhakal after the results.The RSP, which emerged as the national political force in the November 2022 election, still has a long way to go before it becomes a major political party that can go toe to toe against the likes of the Congress and the UML, experts say. “It seems the RSP has some currency in the urban areas of the country, but when it comes to the countryside, they still need to work hard to establish a base,” Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political scientist, told the Post.For Bhatta, party president Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the cooperative scam is another reason why RSP could not perform well in Ilam-2.Lamichhane, who is also the deputy prime minister and minister of home affairs, has been accused in the cooperative fund embezzlement cases lodged in Kaski District Court and Rupandehi District Court. Lamichhane has been denying his involvement. \nNepal on Saturday hosted the first international LGBTIQ tourism conference. It wants a chunk of the multi-billion dollar pink market after the stunning success of a legally recognised same-sex marriage last November.“Forget Nepal’s biased history. Now, we aim at building more just and equitable societies. Let the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex or queer (LGBTIQ) get equal economic opportunity,” said Sunil Babu Pant, the first openly gay former parliamentarian in Asia, addressing the conference in Kathmandu.Just a few years back, police beating gay and transgender individuals in the streets used to be a common sight.“After fighting legal battles for nearly two decades, the law and the society have accepted the LGBTIQ community. Now we are in the second phase—we need equal economic opportunities. For this we need to bring LGBTIQ tourists from the global market.”The conference was announced following the successful marriage registration of Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung, the first same-sex couple to get legally recognised in Nepal, on November 29, 2023, after a years-long legal wrangling.This interim arrangement remains valid until the legal provisions are made.Their legally recognised same-sex marriage is the first of its kind in South Asia and marks a milestone for LGBTIQ rights.“It is a privilege to stand before you and reflect on a pivotal moment in my career, one that underscores the importance of justice, equality, and the pursuit of human rights,” said Supreme Court Justice Hari Prasad Phuyal, who in 2007 as a lawyer argued in favour of laws guaranteeing full rights of LGBTIQ people and in defining gender minorities as “natural persons” under the law. They had the right to marry, he argued. Eventually, in December 2007, the court issued a historic verdict ensuring the rights of the community.The verdict reads: “No one has the right to question how two adults perform sexual intercourse and whether this intercourse is natural or unnatural and that … the way the right to privacy is secured to two heterosexual individuals in sexual intercourse, it is equally secured to the people of third gender who have a different gender identity and sexual orientation.” “In 2007, I found myself entrusted with a case… by Sunil Babu Pant that would leave an indelible mark on my journey. At the helm of Blue Diamond Society, Sunil brought forth a case that demanded not just representation, but a profound understanding of the struggle faced by the LGBTIQ community,” said Phuyal.“Admittedly, my initial knowledge was limited on the issue, but through dedicated learning and unwavering commitment, I found the confidence to evoke it, and here we have it. The outcome, a resounding decision of the Supreme Court, stands as a backbone of hope and progress not only for Nepal but the world at large.“We recognise that the civil and political rights are fundamental, but so are economic, social and cultural rights.”He said that “rainbow tourism” not only promises economic growth but presents an opportunity to foster inclusion and empowerment in the LGBTIQ community. “By integrating them into the national economy, we not only create employment opportunities but also contribute to the overall prosperity of our nation.”He stressed that the decision made by Nepal’s Supreme Court is a precedent for other countries, including the neighbours. Diane Anderson-Minshall, CEO and chief storyteller of GO Magazine, in her presentation titled ‘LGBTI Tourism Global Overview and its Contribution to the Economy’, said that LGBTIQ or pink tourism are the segments of travellers that have a lot of wealth and purchasing power. According to her, based on the Wealth and Travel Data Report of LGBT Capital 2023, the global annual spending power of LGBTIQ consumers is $4.7 trillion. Among them, the Americans have a spending capacity of $1.4 trillion, followed by the Chinese at $872 billion, Germans at $224 billion, Indians at $168 billion and the British at $164 billion. China is an untapped market and that’s going to grow over the next several years. “And one of the things that we know from Chinese gay travellers is they are looking for places they feel safe, where they can hold hands and where they can have new experiences.”And those are things they'll find in Nepal, said Anderson-Minshall. Germany and the UK are the LGBTIQ capitals. Nandini Lahe-Thapa, director of the Nepal Tourism Board, said, “For Nepal’s tourism industry, the LGBTIQ conference is a triumph as this is one of the most important market segments that we have yet to tap.”To attract more tourists to spend more and stay longer, Nepal is following the principle of ‘tourism for all and the power for all seasons and all reasons’, said Lahe-Thapa. “And so we are very proud to partner with the first-ever Rainbow Tourism International Conferences.”People choose to travel to places where they feel safe, respected and can be themselves.“People might feel uncomfortable sharing their identity and choices if the place and the people are judgmental and unfriendly. Here we have an advantage as a destination,” said Lahe-Thapa.Nepal Tourism Board and the travel trade fraternity plan to capitalise on the potential of the pink community worldwide and have started investing in creating a more friendly and enabled environment to foster such tourism. Last year, the board organised a trekking guide training for 25 individuals from the LGBTIQ community.According to Pant, now there are several businesses owned by members of the LGBTIQ communities—with at least two dozen bars, restaurants, travel and tour operators and hotels in Kathmandu. “Businesses are opening up for the queer and that’s a good sign. We can promote Nepal as a same-sex marriage and honeymoon destination.”Nepal’s diverse culture includes rich LGBTIQ-related traditions. Exploring the country’s festivals, temples, symbols, rituals and stories, such as the concept of Ajima and the recognition of six genders, offers a unique cultural experience.Pant said that they have launched a ‘tantra heritage tour’ that provides an in-depth exploration of Nepal's culture and spiritual aspects, including those related to matriarchy and LGBTIQ communities.The pink community worldwide opens up a new segment of valuable visitors for Nepal.Veronique Lorenzo, the EU ambassador to Nepal, said, “For Nepal, this is the first of many happy journeys. I think this conference can play an important role in supporting Nepal’s economy and helping the LGBTIQ community with jobs and recognition. There's an array of benefits from this tourism segment.”“Nepal is a success story. It's the second country in Asia to have have registered same-sex marriage. Of course, there's still a lot of progress to be made. The fight has to go on every day to bring the legislative and legal frameworks in line with the evolution of society.”“It's not just about the pink money, it's also about promoting inclusiveness and being fair to travellers.”  \nRemittance-dependent Nepal may face a dizzying sequence of shocks, particularly in the labour market, due to escalating tensions in the Middle East following Iran's attack on Israel on Saturday, experts have warned.Reports show that Tehran has warned it will strike again with greater force if Israel or the US retaliates for the Iranian strike on Israel. The Iranian attack, which involved more than 300 drones and missiles, were carried out on Saturday night. In India, several leading airlines have cancelled flights to Iran and restricted their use of Israeli and Iranian airspace amid rapidly escalating tensions. This has spurred worries for Nepal, which is mostly dependent on remittance earnings that make for a substantial portion of its economy.Most rural households now depend on at least one member's earnings from employment abroad. Due to remittances, according to the latest living standard survey, the average annual spending on consumption rose by 66 percent in the past 12 years, reaching Rs126,172 in 2023 from Rs75,902 in 2011.According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, the remittance inflow stood at $9.33 billion in the last fiscal year, the record-high earnings that have taken the country’s foreign exchange reserve to a historic high. In the last fiscal year, 774,976 Nepali left the country for foreign jobs. According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank, Qatar is the top source market for Nepal, hosting 133,262 workers in the last fiscal year, followed by the UAE (116,160), Saudi Arabia (112,777), Kuwait (43,508), Oman (5,294), Bahrain (7,690) and Jordan (1,019).Israel hosted 1,084 Nepali workers in the last fiscal year. Experts say that a crisis in the Middle East, which employs nearly half of the migrant workers from Nepal, will potentially hit Nepal and suggest preparing strategies to absorb the emerging geopolitical shocks. “Tensions in the Middle East are not a good sign for a country like Nepal whose income largely depends on remittances,” said Ganesh Gurung, a migration expert. Besides, say economists, conflict in the key oil-producing countries pushes up inflation.The Asian Development Bank said in its recent report that any intensified geopolitical turmoil could disrupt supply chains, increasing global inflation and tightening financial conditions worldwide. This may lead to tightening of domestic monetary policy, which will undermine investment and consumption and may drag down growth for the ailing Nepali economy. “As we see, 1,200 to 1,500 Nepalis are leaving daily for Gulf countries for jobs. The conflict will stop many Nepalis from going to such countries. If these countries stopped hiring workers, the number of unemployed will rise,” said Gurung. “Greater unemployment at home could bring social disturbances.” Experts say the decline in remittances will reduce Nepal’s foreign currency reserves, which may cause severe stress on the economy as domestic production has stagnated.“The government needs to start preparing to absorb the potential shock,” said Gurung. Some countries are already working out strategies to avoid potential economic impact.On Sunday, the South Korean government announced heightened vigilance against potential domestic repercussions in light of the escalated tensions in the Middle East following Iran's attack on Israel, according to media reports.Also on Sunday, the Embassy of Nepal in Tel Aviv, Israel issued a notice requesting Nepalis to follow the local protocol directed by the Israeli Home Front Command. Nepal’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it is closely following the development in West Asia. “We are seriously concerned at the rising tensions and escalation of hostilities in the region. The government of Nepal firmly believes in a peaceful resolution of disputes and deplores the use of force. We call on all the parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint and use dialogue and diplomacy to restore peace,” the embassy statement said.Oil prices have also started going up.On Sunday, the Brent crude oil price reached $90.21 per barrel. Oil rose 1 percent on Friday on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.Last week, oil prices neared a six-month high on concerns that Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), might retaliate for a suspected Israeli warplane attack on Iran’s embassy in Damascus last Monday, according to the reports.The conflict’s impact on global oil markets is significant, as any risk of supply disruptions could lead to a price hike. Nepal is still bearing the cost of high oil prices which has pushed up inflation.Rising conflict has become a major concern for the disruption in the supply chain as Iran has threatened to shut down the Suez Canal. The disruption of shipping routes in the Red Sea will result in higher shipping costs, according to media reports.The World Bank said in its recent report that the cost of shipping from Asia to Europe has jumped to over US$3,000 for a 40-foot container, a threefold increase over the lowest rate in 2023 (about US$1,000).“The rise in tensions in the Middle East means trade disturbances globally,” said Chandramani Adhikari, an economist. “For Nepal, most of whose remittance comes from the Middle Eastern nations, it could spell disaster.”The government is happy with the improvements in external sectors which is mostly due to the boost in remittance. “But as soon as the labour markets get hit, there will be a direct impact on the country’s income,” said Adhikari. “People who are working in the conflict-hit countries might experience reduced savings due to the rise in the cost of living in the destination countries,” Adhikari said. “The rise in tensions will have an impact on the tourist arrivals as countries will issue travel advisories,” Adhikari said. “More polarisation among powerful economies, as they spend more on war, will also affect the foreign aid being provided to Nepal, besides foreign investment,” Adhikari said.The international conflict also has the potential to strengthen the dollar. The rise in oil prices and dollar rate will affect Nepal’s economy side-by-side as it impacts consumption and increases inflation, Adhikari said. “So, all these phenomena will hit Nepal’s economy.” \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane co-hosted \"Project Sambad,\" a forum for scrutinizing Nepali society and policy-making, with its inaugural event held in Kathmandu on March 14-15.\nNepali Congress' obstruction leads to adjournment of parliament until Thursday, preventing PM Dahal from presenting policies and a motion of thanks to the President.\nRegional political parties in Nepal, prominent after 2006, have experienced numerous splits and divisions, including the formation of new parties and resignation from government positions, leaving their influence diminished due to internal conflicts.\nA party split within the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) threatens to destabilize the Madhesh provincial government, with the CPN (Maoist Centre) discussing the formation of a new government while the JSP-Nepal claims to have the support of its provincial members.\nThe Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-N) led by Upendra Yadav will challenge the Election Commission's recognition of a new party formed by its spliter group, citing the absence of legal provisions for such a split.\nAlmost a year ago, CPN-UML, the then main opposition party, had demanded a high-level judicial commission to look into the involvement of influential leaders of the Nepali Congress and the CPN (Maoist Centre) in gold smuggling.Nepali Congress, then a main partner of the coalition government, had rejected such a demand.Now the UML, the senior partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, has rejected outright the demand of Congress, now the main opposition party, to form a parliamentary investigation committee against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling cooperative funds.The UML last year obstructed parliamentary proceedings for about a month as its demand was rejected by the ruling parties in the initial phase. At the time, the Congress fiercely criticised the UML for disrupting the House businesses, insisting on the panel’s formation.Now, the Congress, which continued its protests during the winter session of Parliament before it was prorogued on April 14, has warned of obstructing the new session of Parliament should the committee not be constituted.The new session of Parliament, which will pass the budget for the upcoming fiscal year, is scheduled to commence on Friday.However, UML leaders claim that their demand for the judicial investigation commission last year and the Congress’ demand for the parliamentary probe committee this time around are not the same.Many suspected the involvement of powerful people in gold smuggling, the UML leader said. “Therefore, we demanded a judicial probe commission independent of the state apparatus. Our demand was perfect; Congress leaders later admitted it and expressed their gratitude for our stance,” said UML leaders.Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, addressing the House last month, thanked UML leaders for their demand for a judicial committee to investigate the gold smuggling episode.“The Congress has shown its double standard regarding Home Minister Lamichhane,” UML Chief Whip Mahesh Bartaula told the Post. “Their leaders participated in parliamentary committee meetings where the home minister was present and addressed them. Why don’t they allow him to address the plenum of the same parliament?”In a meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee on Wednesday, Home Minister Lamichhane was present. He appeared before the committee also on March 28 and denied the allegations against him while responding to the questions raised by lawmakers. The committee is led by Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada.The views of the accused person need to be heard before forming any committee to probe him, argued Bartaula. However, the Congress leaders say they have already listened to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in Parliament defending Lamichhane and they are not satisfied with it. Thus the stance, they argue.“If their demand for a probe committee is honoured, the Congress will seek the home minister’s resignation to make the government unstable,” Bartaula said.Congress leaders want to make the parliamentary committee against the home minister a precondition for the smooth sailing of the new session of Parliament. Congress leaders argue that the judicial investigation commission earlier demanded by the UML and the parliamentary probe they want to constitute are different.Lamichhane has been linked with the cooperatives' embezzlement cases currently in Kaski and Rupandehi district courts. However, the state apparatus has undermined the cases and is trying to prove him innocent, Congress leaders argue.High-ranking officials including Prime Minister Dahal and Inspector General of Police Basanta Bahadur Kunwar have defended Lamichhane arguing that he is not guilty. Lately, the Attorney General’s office also has tried to prove him innocent, Congress leaders allege.“Despite the police reports which suggest Home Minister Lamichhane was involved in the cooperative scam, the whole state apparatus is trying to prove him innocent,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, the Congress spokesperson told the Post. “Therefore, our demand for a probe committee becomes all the more important.”From July 19 last year, the UML disrupted parliamentary meetings demanding a high-level probe into gold smuggling saying that the role of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police was not sufficient. But the ruling parties, including the Congress, at the time insisted that there was no need for another committee while the state agencies are competent enough to investigate and expose the wrong-doers, even if they are senior leaders.The UML, however, doubted the police investigation saying it wouldn’t be able to reach the masterminds of the gold haul claiming that police would have a slimmer chance to interrogate influential people of the ruling parties. After a serious discussion to lift the obstruction of Parliament, the government bowed to the pressure and formed a judicial committee on August 22 to probe gold smuggling following the Commission of Inquiry Act 1969. Dilli Raj Acharya, a former high court chief judge, led the commission.The commission submitted its report after studying the lapses in police investigation into the scam that involved the smuggling of 60kg gold by hiding the precious metal in motorcycle brake shoe imports. It also looked into another scam wherein 9kg of gold was smuggled by concealing it in electronic cigarettes in December 2022.The commission, in its report, implicated former Speaker and Maoist vice-chair Krishna Bahadur Mahara, among other powerful individuals, in the smuggling. Then police remanded Mahara and other accused persons in custody as suggested by the commission on March 18, 2024. However, he was released without bail on March 22 on the condition that he will be present to the CIB as and when needed.Citing the success of the judicial commission in the gold smuggling case, the Congress has now demanded a parliamentary probe against Lamichhane in the case of cooperative funds misappropriation.“Since no sitting ministers or high-profile people were accused in the gold smuggling case, we initially were reluctant to form a committee,” Mahat said.Amid accusations of cooperative operators defrauding depositors of millions of rupees, Lamichhane has repeatedly said he has no accounts in any cooperatives. Hence, there is no question of his involvement in embezzling the deposits, he argues. Lamichhane, then managing director of the Gorkha Media Network, and his business partner GB Rai, who has left the country, are accused of rerouting the cooperative funds to the now-closed Galaxy 4k Television.Speaker Ghimire summoned an all-party meeting on Tuesday, during which the ruling coalition recommended formation of a committee tasked with investigating the issues facing the cooperative sector as a whole, uncovering fraudulent activities there, and identifying the individuals responsible. Additionally, they suggested that the committee should take legal action against those engaged in the fraud.The Congress sticks to its demand for the probe committee.The two largest political parties, the Congress and the UML, have differing positions based on whether they are in the government or in the opposition. The UML, while in the opposition, had demanded the judicial committee in the gold smuggling case while the Congress, the coalition partner, had opposed it. Similar is the case in the cooperative scam where the Congress wants a parliamentary probe committee and the currently ruling party, UML, opposes it.Being in power or not should not determine whether to demand a probe committee or a judicial committee, political experts say. Both parliamentary or judicial committees are constituted in rare cases or that is the case in other countries, they said.“It is a clear example of our state mechanisms becoming dysfunctional,” Dambar Khatiwada, a political expert, told the Post. “Otherwise, political parties should have faith in the state apparatus rather than demand such committees.” \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n**Summarization:**\n\nKey events unfold, marked by battles, alliances, treaties, and political shifts, shaping the course of history.\nA man succumbs to burn injuries from a fire in Tapeshwar community forest while another remains hospitalized; a separate fire in Ananda forest forces evacuation of 65 patients from Anandaban Hospital.\nSeven Kathmandu wards have implemented waste segregation rules, with compost production, biogas generation, and non-degradable waste recycling being undertaken to address the city's garbage issue.\nEU-Nepal Business Forum 2024 to promote European investment in Nepal as part of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations, focusing on renewable energies and ICT sectors.\nThe Special Court summons five foreign individuals and five companies for a hearing in the 'wide-body scam' involving the purchase of Airbus A330s in 2017, alleging corruption and financial embezzlement causing a loss of Rs1.47 billion to the Nepalese government.\nThe private sector has urged the government to introduce a competitive tax rate to prevent smuggling, which has become rampant in the bordering areas, hurting the government’s revenue largely.Speaking at an economic summit titled ‘Fundamental Need of Economy: Joint Commitment from Political Leaders’ organised by Kantipur Media Group, in Kathmandu on Sunday, private sector representatives stressed the need for the government to introduce a progressive tax system citing the ongoing economic slowdown. They said such a tax system stimulates demand and spurs economic activity. Tax policies normally influence economic conditions.Kamlesh Agrawal, president of the Nepal Chamber of Commerce, said that Nepal and India share an open border, but the price difference in goods and services between the two immediate neighbours is 30-40 percent. “[Cross-border] Smuggling is thriving due to the price differences.”“To control the smuggling, the tax rates need to be made competitive,” said Agrawal. He was speaking on the theme ‘Issues of the private sector in budget, planning of policymakers’ during the first session of the summit.According to him, India has a 5-6 percent goods and service tax on essential goods while taxes on luxury goods are high. But in Nepal, the government has imposed a 13 percent VAT on essential goods.The private sector said that Nepal’s tax system is ‘upside-down’, meaning that people with lower incomes pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes than those with higher incomes. Agrawal questioned whether it was logical to impose the same VAT rates on all types of goods in a socialist economy system, where the factors of production like labour and natural resources are under the control of the government. He called for flipping Nepal’s tax system from a flat tax model. “The tax rate on essential goods should be reduced.” Agrawal said that all the political parties have committed to creating an environment for investment and economic development during the recently held Nepal Investment Summit, and now, the private sector is seeking to materialise the commitment.The private sector views three reasons for the current economic slowdown. Firstly, the government discouraged the private sector by imposing an import ban. Secondly, the slowdown in Nepal was due to the impact of the global economic slowdown. And thirdly, the policies and politics in Nepal are unstable which make investors think twice and thrice before making an investment plan.Nepal’s GDP has been projected to grow by 3.3 percent this fiscal year, mainly due to improvements in the tourism and hydropower sectors, according to the National Statistics Office. The national statistics show the construction and manufacturing sector is in negative growth while retail and wholesale trade are at near negative growth. These are the major pillars of the economy that engage major parts of the private sector.“So, in the upcoming budget, the government’s priority needs to be to end the economic slowdown and protect the private sector through policy reforms,” said Agrawal.Rajesh Agrawal, president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), said that for the last two years, the private sector has been facing trouble. “Trade and business are in crisis. Entrepreneurs are in a dire situation.”“Many small and medium entrepreneurs are leaving the country, especially to work abroad following the tight policies.” The external sector has recovered, but it has failed to revitalise the internal economy. “The improving external sector is mainly due to a robust increase in remittances, and the government is happy. We should think intensely about why remittances are increasing,” said the CNI president.“If we want to substitute imports and shift to production, then the government needs to bring stable policies. Without stable policies, it is difficult to invest as it requires a huge amount of money to open an industry,” he said.Chandra Prasad Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that investors are not confident to invest as they have doubts that the policies will change as soon as the government changes. Dhakal said, for instance, the previous budget made arrangements for the merger and acquisition of banks. “This year’s budget changed that policy. This is just an example. There have been many such instances in the past.”While the government may collect some taxes from mergers and acquisitions, it does not send a positive message to investors, Dhakal said. “The budget should address this issue.”Dhakal said that the situation of the economic slowdown has arrived due to the government’s mindset that the private sector, which only looks for profits, should be taxed top-down.Kalpana Khanal, a senior researcher at Policy Research Institute, a Kathmandu-based policy think tank, said that after Covid-19, the central bank had to opt for expansionary monetary policies and at the same time the fiscal policy too was expansionary as it was the demand of time. “This caused the sharp rise in the credit-to-GDP ratio, which means higher credit expansion.”The credit expansion, however, did not benefit the productive sector and instead went to the real estate sector. The profit was reinvested in the same sector. With this, banks and financial institutions have seen a rise in their non-performing assets as they fail to recover the loans.According to Khanal, in recent months deposits in banks are increasing by 14-15 percent, while credit is increasing by a meagre 4-5 percent. This shows a slowdown in investment.The tight monetary policies caused a fall in imports. “As the country’s revenue policy is directly linked to import, the government failed to collect revenue,” Khanal said. She said that other challenges in the economy include policies and political instability.Madhu Marasini, secretary at the Ministry of Finance, said that Nepal is a small open economy and that is why the impact of external factors makes the country’s economy vulnerable. “This means any global uncertainty will hit Nepal’s imports as the country is now import-dependent. Our production base not only has declined, but also become less competitive,” he said. “We need to become self-sufficient. We need our agriculture to grow.”He said that the country could not prosper by importing agri goods of Rs300 billion.Bureaucrats are traditional and conservative by nature so they do not dare to make fundamental huge shifts, Marasini said, adding that the system is guided by a political system. “The government is clear on not intervening much in tax, industrial and investment policies. We are here to facilitate businesses. If there is willingness from all political parties, the policies too will be favourable.”          \nFinance Minister Barshaman Pun on Sunday said that there was a need for critically analysing the state of the country.Speaking at the fourth edition of the Kantipur Economic Summit organised by the Kantipur Media Group, Minister Pun underscored the need to correct past mistakes and to review the shortcomings of the political parties and their leaders.“The overall situation of the country needs to be critically analysed. But that doesn’t mean that everything is bad and unsatisfactory,” Pun said. “Despite not being able to work to our full capacity, we have witnessed good progress in the hospitality and hydropower sectors among others, even during an economic slowdown.”The finance minister also said that the central and provincial governments had failed to coordinate, resulting in a failure to spend the money as allocated in the fiscal budget.While the state coffers fall short of Rs161 billion, the provincial and local bodies have been failing to spend Rs246 billion, Pun said. “We could not work in coordination.”He also admitted that the government had failed to invest in the construction industry, resulting in negative growth in the sector and slowed business. “This issue is understandable and not to shift blame to others. It is for the government to take care of.”Nepal Chamber of Commerce President Kamlesh Kumar Agrawal noted that the situation of the construction industry and the private sector was concerning.Agrawal claimed that the private sector, considered to be a key driver of the economy, had become sluggish due to restraints in the policies.The Nepali economy, which thrived even during the 2015 earthquake, India’s blockade, the Covid pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war, has now slowed down to policies that are unfavourable for investments, Agrawal said.The government policies, which are more stringent than required, have also negatively affected the morale of the industrialists, said Chandra Prasad Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industries.“The government took unnecessary precautions fearing a similar fate as that of Sri Lanka, which faced an economic crisis after the Covid pandemic. This not only impacted the private sector but resulted in a downfall in revenue collection,” Dhakal said. “The next budget should be formulated to increase the confidence of businesses and the general public.”According to Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries, the lack of investment and employment opportunities has also led to even business owners leaving the country.Adding to the mass exodus of Nepali youths, people operating small-scale businesses have also been compelled to leave the country due to unfavourable government policies, the CNI President said.In such a condition, the country has reached a state of having to rejoice in an increase in remittance, he added.“There is a necessity to develop a strategy to identify the goods and products deserving policy incentives,” Agrawal said. Likewise, Upendra Mahato, president of the Non-Resident Nepali Association, stated that the government had failed to realise the investment potential of the non-resident Nepalis.Besides sending remittances, the NRNA, which hosts approximately 6 million members, is also capable of investing in the country, Mahato stressed.The Nepal-NRN fund, jointly formed by the Nepali government and the NRNA, has a potential to bring in funds worth billions of dollars, but has not been able to do so, Mahato said.  “The government is eager to take funds, but going through the official procedures is tedious,” Mahato added. \nAs pre-monsoon rains pick up pace, concerns mount about an imminent outbreak of the dengue disease. All that is required for the disease to flare up are stagnant water and hot temperatures, both already present in various parts of the country.“Dengue vectors are already there in many places across the country,” said Professor Murari Das, an entomologist at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “With the right conditions like water and warmth required for vector breeding available now, we can expect a spike in dengue cases in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that 57 districts, including three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—have already reported cases of dengue infection.“On average, around 50 people across the country are becoming infected with the dengue virus every week,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “The number could rise in the coming days, as pre-monsoon rainfall activities have recently increased.”Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease throughout the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Around 1,000 people have already been infected with the deadly disease since the start of 2024, according to officials.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of people infected with the deadly virus do not show any symptoms. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus throughout the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Experts say that this is the right time to prepare and prevent possible outbreaks in the coming days.They say that it will be too late if they wait for a massive outbreak. Authorities concerned should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance and take other measures to cut the risk, according to them. Health Ministry officials said that they have alerted all agencies concerned about the risk of a dengue outbreak.“We have alerted all relevant agencies about the risk of a dengue outbreak in the coming days,’ said Dahal. Authorities and agencies at some local units have started activities to make people aware of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, including launching an awareness drive.”Dengue has become endemic in Nepal, as cases of infection are reported throughout the year. Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities are yet to take it seriously. They believe that this lackadaisical approach is responsible for the spread of the virus. What authorities concerned do most of the time is count the number of infections and deaths, according to them.They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population plans to screen pregnant women for mental health problems, which have been emerging as a leading cause of maternal deaths.Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and prompt treatment will help cut down on maternal deaths that have been rising alarmingly of late.“We plan to start screening from Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital,” said Dr Gauri Shrestha, chief of the Safe Motherhood Programme at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “As part of the pilot, all pregnant women seeking service will be screened from the first and postnatal trimesters.”A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with the majority occurring during pregnancy.The report shows that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications.Nepal had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The report showed 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. The study was carried out in 2021.Every year, hundreds of women in the country succumb to preventable deaths from excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), which have been identified as chief causes of maternal deaths in Nepal.However, the 2021 study also shows that a significant number of maternal deaths are also caused by non-obstetric complications such as intentional self-harm.Of the 611 maternal deaths on which the study was based, 67 percent occurred during and after childbirth, according to the report.The census report shows 33 percent of the total maternal deaths occurred during pregnancy, six percent died during childbirth and 61 percent during the postpartum stage.Of the total maternal deaths, nearly a half (47 percent) occurred in Lumbini and Madhesh provinces. The report shows that 10 percent of the victims were 15 to 19 years old. Fifty-seven percent of the deaths happened in health facilities and 26 percent at homes. Of the total maternal deaths, 412 women (53 per cent) went to four antenatal care visits, and of the 173 women who died between seven to 42 days, 45 percent had received postnatal care.As part of its efforts to reduce maternal deaths, the Health Ministry has made it mandatory for women to make eight antenatal care visits and three postnatal care visits.Of the total maternal deaths, six percent (37 women) had undergone abortion or suffered a miscarriage. The report shows that 62 percent of the women took maternity services at state-run health facilities whereas 38 percent gave birth at private health centres.The report shows family members of 83 percent of women who died during or after childbirth tried to get hospital care. Forty-eight percent of those who did use hospital services did not deem it necessary to seek institutional care, according to the report.Delay in finding appropriate health facilities (57 percent), delay in reaching appropriate health facilities (33 percent) and delay in getting appropriate health services (40 percent) are three major causes of maternal deaths, the study shows. Of the total maternal deaths, 17 percent were attributed to all three aforementioned causes and 74 percent to at least one of three causes.The report suggested improving the quality of services and the referral system and making ambulances available for emergency calls as possible ways for identifying the risks on time. The report also suggested carrying out maternal death surveillance regularly to reduce preventable deaths.The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes including free institutional delivery service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. The ministry has also distributed misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. “As the annual health budget does not help us carry out screening of mental health programmes in many places, we are starting the programme as a pilot from the Maternity Hospital,” said Shrestha. “This programme will be expanded in the coming years to other districts, as it is impossible to prevent suicide of pregnant women without treatment of mental health problems.”Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nAt least 50 health workers including medical officers, health assistants and paramedics serving in health facilities of Kathmandu district have been trained to screen patients suffering from non-communicable diseases.The Kathmandu Health Office provided the health workers with a four-day training. The trained health workers will screen major non-communicable diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health problems, among others, in patients seeking healthcare at local health facilities of the district, according to officials at the Health Office Kathmandu.“Patients seeking healthcare services at the local units of Kathmandu will be screened for non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “Health workers will prescribe medicines for non-communicable diseases, counsel patients and refer them to a tertiary care centre if the problems are complicated.”Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.The study showed that the leading risk factor of death in 2019 was smoking, whose attributable death was 17.7 percent, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution 9.3 percent, diabetes 8 percent, high cholesterol, and kidney dysfunction, among others.The Ministry of Health and Population has included medicines for non-communicable diseases in the list of 98 free essential medicines, which it provides free of cost from state-run health facilities.The free medicines on the list include medicines for some non-communicable diseases—mental health, cardiovascular, respiratory illness and diabetes, among others.Officials say that even if the burden of non-communicable diseases surpassed communicable diseases years ago and medicines for some ailments are provided free of cost, many people do not know their disease conditions due to lack of screening at health facilities.The Health Ministry in the past had decided to provide free screening for certain non-communicable diseases to people above 40 years old. However, such services have not started in many health facilities.“Trained health workers will screen the patients visiting health facilities they serve at,” said Sapkota. “We hope that patients suffering from non-communicable diseases will be diagnosed on time, which will ultimately help in lessening the burden of non-communicable diseases.”Doctors say most people do not undergo testing unless it is an emergency and also do not know if they are suffering from a serious ailment. They say that a lot of lives will be saved if testing of non-communicable diseases is made free.Public health experts say the increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases is a global phenomenon but developing countries like Nepal have been facing a double burden. \nIn nine months of the current fiscal year, the Department of Drug Administration has tested 348 samples of medicines collected by its drug inspectors from across the country.Of nearly 20,000 medicines, both registered and unregistered ones in the market, drug inspectors had collected for testing hundreds of samples of drugs suspected to be substandard.However, the department, which is also the national regulatory body of the drug market, carried out tests on less than two percent of the total registered drugs in the country.“Some samples of medicines collected by our drug inspectors some 13 months ago are yet to be tested,” said Narayan Dhakal, director general of the department. “Some samples suspected to be substandard and collected for a quality test might already have expired.”Ensuring the quality of medicines being prescribed to patients is the responsibility of the department. Its drug inspectors collect samples of medicines on a random basis from the market and send them for lab tests at the National Medicines Laboratory under the department.Officials at the DDA said several samples of medicines on which quality testing was carried out in the current fiscal year were found substandard and recalled from the market.Dhakal concedes that the samples tested by the department are not sufficient to ensure the quality of the medicines.“We have tested too few samples,” an official at the department said. “And the fact is some medicines on which tests were done were found to be substandard, which means other drugs in the market also could be problematic. Patients might have been taking substandard medicines.”Experts say the use of substandard medicines could adversely affect patients’ health. Dhakal said that ensuring the quality of the medicines is also the responsibility of the drug manufacturing companies and it is not possible to test each and every medicine.“I must concede that we have not tested nearly enough medicines to ensure quality,” said Dhakal. “Several factors including understaffing are responsible for this.”Around 40 staffers have been serving in the National Medicines Laboratory under the department.Ensuring the quality of medicines in Nepal has always been an issue, as the national drug regulator grapples with a staff crunch, and its laboratory doesn't have the capacity to carry out timely tests.Drug inspectors deployed from the DDA take random samples of drugs and send them for testing to the government’s laboratory. If drugs are found problematic or substandard, the department directs the manufacturing companies to recall those drugs from the market. However, the department does not have an effective mechanism to ensure the recall either.In most cases, delays in testing at the laboratory mean that results come in only after all the substandard drugs in the market have been sold.While thousands of medicines manufactured by national as well as international pharma companies are being sold from pharmacies across the country, DDA inspectors collect only around 1,000 samples in a year. The inspection work is especially hard as the DDA has just around two dozen drug inspectors tasked with monitoring over 21,000 registered pharmacies and thousands of unregistered ones.Moreover, it takes several months to examine some medicines as the DDA’s laboratory is understaffed with several posts for technicians remaining vacant. The department allows the drug manufacturing companies to supply medicines to the market directly from the factory. \nA few weeks ago, an eight-month-old baby girl from Arubari in the Capital was rushed to the Chabahil-based Om Hospital and Research Center, as the child was experiencing shortness of breath.The child’s parents told the doctor that the baby didn't have a fever but would make a wheezing sound while exhaling.“The baby was suffering from childhood asthma,” said Dr Rita Hamal, a consultant paediatrician at the hospital. “We admitted her and provided oxygen therapy. It took three days for her condition to improve.”As the Capital’s air quality continues to worsen, often reaching hazardous levels, this is a common refrain among hundreds of children brought to hospitals for treatment of childhood asthma.The ongoing forest fires, vehicular and industrial emissions, and the burning of agriculture residue throughout the country have made the air toxic, exacerbating asthma problems in small children.A recent report by Save the Children shows critical linkages between air pollution and multi-faceted hazards for children.The report titled “Breathless Future: Unveiling the Impacts of Air Pollution on Children and Women in Kathmandu and Saptari” shows the systemic impact of air pollution on various aspects of children's lives. The report also explored the effects of air pollution on women and underrepresented groups.“Deteriorating air quality, both outdoors and indoors, has exposed children and women to a multitude of health hazards— asthma, other lung conditions, coughing, skin disease, nausea, and headache,” reads the report. “ Alarmingly, these conditions have led to increased cases of pregnancy loss, child organ underdevelopment, and a general decline in life expectancy.”The study carried out in Kathmandu and Saptari, two of the most polluted districts in the country, highlights a significant knowledge gap related to air pollution, including its effects in indoor settings and associated health risks, particularly for women and children who spend extensive periods inside their homes. Experts say the deterioration of air quality seriously affects public health. Poor air quality causes both short- and long-term effects on public health. Bad air quality can cause pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke and heart problems, among others, in the short term, ulcers and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease and heart problems in the long run.People living in areas with high levels of air pollution are most likely to suffer from asthma, and small children are not immune to these problems, according to doctors. “Earlier more children would suffer from pneumonia,” said Dr Ganesh Rai, former director at the Kanti Children’s Hospital, Kathmandu. “These days, cases of childhood asthma have surpassed pneumonia.”Child health experts say that in most cases childhood asthma can be cured by an appropriate and timely treatment but uncontrolled asthma can lead to lung damage. In many cases, parents mistake asthma for pneumonia. Some parents are unaware of the signs, and the children could suffer from asthma, although asthma is commonly associated with the elderly.“Polluted air has exacerbated childhood asthma in our country, this fact should be understood by all,” said Rai. “Oftentimes, when children do not show fever or other symptoms, parents unknowingly overlook asthma and do not take the children to hospital for too long. It is crucial to seek medical help if a child has shortness of breath, trouble sleeping, or wheezing while breathing out.”Apart from polluted air, several other triggering factors including allergies, family history of asthma, and frequent respiratory illnesses are also responsible for childhood asthma, according to doctors. Studies show that polluted air has been shortening the lives of Nepali people. Polluted air has been cutting short the lives of Nepali people by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively.The reduction in life expectancy depends on where one lives—7.5 years in Mahottari, 7.4 years in Rautahat and Dhanusha, and 7.2 years in Sarlahi and Bara districts, the AQLI report said. Likewise, the pollution has been shaving 6.7 years off the lives of people residing in Siraha, and 6.2 years in Saptari and Rupandehi districts. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance.

Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nCoach Vincenzo Alberto Annese has announced a 28-member preliminary squad for Nepal’s 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup second round qualifier match against the United Arab Emirates.Rohit Chand has returned to the squad after missing out both legs against Bahrain in March.Defenders Abhishek Limbu, Bishal Basnet, Saubhagya Rai and Ajay Chaudhary, midfielder Rohan Karki and forward Samir Tamang, who were called up for the first time for Bahrain games, have retained their place in the preliminary squad.Nepal, pitted in Group H alongside the UAE, Bahrain and Yemen, have already crashed out of the second round without playing their remaining two matches after a winless run of four successive matches left them at the bottom of the group and without a point.Nepal were scheduled to host the UAE for their second leg at the Dasharath Stadium—Nepal’s only international standard football stadium—on June 6 but will once again play their home fixture at a neutral venue, according to All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) sources. “Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has directed ANFA to find a neutral venue for the UAE fixture citing lack of standard of Dasharath Stadium,” an ANFA source said.AFC representatives had raised questions about the stadium’s pitch, flood light and security following an inspection earlier this month. AFC and ANFA, however, have yet to make their decision public.Nepal were also forced to play their home match against Bahrain at the Bahrain National Stadium in Riffa after AFC deemed Dasharath Stadium unsatisfactory to host the World Cup qualifier game.Nepal lost the double fixture against Bahrain 5-0 and 3-0, which had effectively ended Nepal’s hopes to progress to the third round and book an automatic spot in the Asian Cup.Earlier, Nepal had lost their home match against Yemen 2-0 in Kathmandu and away match to the UAE 4-0 at the Al-Maktoum Stadium in Dubai.Nepal will wrap up their qualifier campaign with a match against Yemen on June 11.Nepal still have hopes to qualify for their maiden Asian Cup. They will play in the Asian Cup Qualification (playoffs) in March next year.Nepal squadGoalkeepers: Abhishek Baral, Bishal Sunar, Kiran Chemjong, Santosh MahatDefenders: Abhishek Limbu, Ananta Tamang, Bimal Pandey, Bishal Basnet, Chhiring Lama, Rohit Chand, Sanish Shrestha, Saubhagya Rai, Ajay Chaudhary, Yogesh GurungMidfielders: Bharat Khawas, Laken Limbu, Mani Kumar Lama, Manish Dangi, Basant Jimba, Phatteman Ghale, Rohan Karki, Sumit ShresthaForwards: Anjan Bista, Dinesh Henjan, Gillespye Jung Karki, Hisub Thapaliya, Samir Tamang, Sanjeeb Bista \nDefending champions Armed Police Force Club maintained its winning streak in the Lalitpur Mayor Women’s T20 Championship defeating Bagmati Province by eight wickets at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Monday.The departmental team, APF, are the most successful side of the T20 tournament having won all three previous editions and stayed on track to reach their fourth final—and potentially a record-extending fourth trophy—thanks to a four-wicket haul from Karuna Bhandari and a brilliant batting display from opener Mamta Chaudhary.APF opted to field first and restricted Bagmati to 73-6 in 20 overs, with Chaudhary playing the destroyer-in-chief as she dismissed opener Kanchan Shrestha (4), Yashoda Bist (3) and Sony Pakhrin (0) to rip apart the top and middle order. Bagmati’s number one batter Helisha Gurung battled alone scoring 31 off 50 balls but eventually fell in the 15th over to APF skipper Sita Rana Magar, who also dismissed Bagmati captain Ashmina Karmacharya (3).Bhandari then got her fourth wicket removing Bipasha Shahi in the 16th over.Khushi Dangol played 14 not out facing 22 deliveries to drag Bagmati past 70 total.In reply, APF lost Rana Magar for 11 in the 2.5 overs and national team captain Indu Barma for 17 in the 6th over but opener Mamta Chaudhary played 35 not out off 32 balls to guide APF to 74-2 in 11 overs.Chaudhary also had little help from Rajmati Airee who made 10 runs off 12 balls.A second straight victory gave APF four points and summit position in the five-team standings. Sudurpaschim also have four points after defeating Koshi Province by 19 runs in the afternoon. They sit in the second position due to net run rate.Samjhana Khadka shone the brightest on the day as her half-century helped Sudurpaschim to a moderate 112-8 total.Khadka scored 54 runs in her 51-ball knock that featured four boundaries.Sudurpaschim lost their opener Sabitri Dhami for a duck in the fourth delivery of the first over and captain Bindu Rawal for 14 in the fifth.But Khadka laid a strong foundation for victory with the first fifty in this edition of the tournament despite a disastrous display from other batters, with Rubi Poddar (2), Kabita Joshi (5), Rewati Dhami (0), Shova Rokaya (0) all departing miserably.Khadka finally found much needed support from Ritu Kanoujiya and the duo put on a 57-run stand for the seventh wicket to guide Sudurpaschim past 100 total. Tailender Ritu Kanoujiya made 23 runs facing 35 deliveries.Hiranmayee Roy, Sabnam Rai and Sangita Rai took two wickets each for Koshi, while Alisha Khadiya picked one.In reply, Kajal Shrestha and Apsari Begam added 52 runs for the second wicket to give Koshi a solid start.However, after Laxmi Saud dispatched Begam for 23 (34) in the 13th over and Rawal got rid of Shrestha for 33 (40) in the 15th over, Koshi stumbled. None other batters could score in double digits as Koshi could only manage 93-7 and succumbed to a second straight loss.Bagmati, who also suffered a second successive loss, lie at the bottom and below fourth-placed Koshi.Lalitpur Mayor’s XI occupy the third position with two points. \nLalitpur Mayor's XI won their opening match of the Lalitpur Mayor Women's T20 Championship with a seven-wicket victory over Bagmati Province, thanks to Kritika Marasini's hat-trick.\nGovernment awards cash prizes totaling Rs29.71 million to athletes and teams, including cricketers qualifying for the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup and a historic silver medalist in karate.\nNepal defeated West Indies A by six wickets in the fifth T20, with Aasif Sheikh, Anil Sah, and Kushal Malla starring with the bat and Sagar Dhakal and Sompal Kami impressive with the ball.\nPM Modi defended his unity amid accusations of division as he filed his re-election nomination while shifting campaign focus towards accusing Congress of favoring Muslims.\nDespite international warnings, Israeli tanks penetrated residential districts of Rafah, intensifying fighting in the southern border city amid heightened Palestinian casualties and a setback in ceasefire efforts.\nPatients taking Novo Nordisk’s (NOVOb.CO), popular Wegovy obesity treatment maintained an average of 10% weight loss after four years on the treatment, the company said on Tuesday.Novo presented the new long-term data at the European Congress on Obesity in Venice, Italy, gleaned from a large study for which much of the results had been published last year.“This is the longest study we’ve conducted so far of semaglutide for weight loss,” Martin Holst Lange, Novo’s head of development, said in an interview, referring to the active ingredient in Wegovy and the company’s diabetes drug Ozempic.“We see that once the majority of the weight loss is accrued, you don’t go back and start to increase in weight if you stay on the drug,” he added.The data could bolster the company’s case as it tries to convince insurers and governments to reimburse Wegovy and deflect notions that it is a lifestyle drug.Wegovy was the first to market from a newer generation of medicines known as GLP-1 agonists, originally developed for diabetes, that provide a new way to address record obesity rates. Eli Lilly (LLY.N), launched its rival drug Zepbound in the United States in December. Neither company has been able to produce enough to meet unprecedented demand.Dr. Simon Cork, Senior Lecturer in Physiology from Anglia Ruskin University, said Britain’s public health service’s decision to limit coverage of the medicine to two years was \"because of questionable long-term effectiveness”.The new data showing benefits continuing to four years may go some way to negating that argument, he said.The 17,604-patient trial tested Wegovy not for weight loss but for its heart protective benefits for overweight and obese patients who had preexisting heart disease but not diabetes. Participants were not required to track diet and exercise because it was not an obesity study.Patients in the trial called Select lost an average of nearly 10% of their total body weight after 65 weeks on Wegovy. That percentage weight-loss was roughly sustained year-on-year until the end of about four years, where weight loss stood at 10.2%, the company said.Wegovy and Zepbound are being tested to assess their benefits in a variety of other medical uses such as lowering heart attack risk and for sleep apnea and kidney disease.The weight loss in the heart trial was less than the average of 15% weight loss in earlier Wegovy obesity studies before the drug was launched in the United States in June 2021. \nAt least 14 people have died and dozens were injured after a huge billboard fell on them during a thunderstorm in India’s financial capital Mumbai, according to local authorities.The billboard collapsed on some houses and a petrol station next to a busy road in the eastern suburb of Ghatkopar following gusty winds and rain late on Monday.Scores were trapped following the incident with rescue operations continuing till early on Tuesday. The thunderstorm brought traffic to a standstill in parts of the city and disrupted operations at its airport, one of the country’s busiest.Mumbai’s municipal corporation said at least 74 people were taken to hospital with injuries following the accident and 31 have been discharged. \nFlash floods and mud slides in Indonesia’s West Sumatra province killed at least 43 people over the weekend while a search for 15 missing people continued, authorities said on Monday.Torrential rain on Saturday evening triggered flash floods, landslides, and cold lava flow - a mud-like mixture of volcanic ash, rock debris and water - in three districts in West Sumatra province, Abdul Malik, chief of the provincial rescue team, told Reuters.The cold lava flow, known in Indonesia as a lahar, came from Mount Marapi, one of Sumatra’s most active volcanoes.In December, more than 20 people were killed after Marapi erupted. A series of eruptions has followed since.“The heavy rain swept materials such as ash and large rocks from the Marapi volcano,” said Abdul Malik, who later added in a statement that 43 people had died and 15 remained missing.“Cold lava flow and flash floods have always been threats to us recently. But the problem is, it always happens late at night until dawn,” he said.Abdul said around 400 personnel, including rescuers, police, and military, were deployed to search for the missing people on Monday, helped by at least eight excavators and drones.The national disaster and management agency BNPB said in a statement almost 200 houses were damaged and 72 hectares (178 acres) of lands, including rice fields, were affected. At least 159 people from Agam district were evacuated to nearby schools.Footage shared by BNPB showed roads and rice fields covered by mud. Video also showed the wreckage of damaged homes and buildings, while the floods brought logs and large rocks into settlements.Eko Widodo, a 43-year-old survivor, said: “The flooding was sudden and the river became blocked which resulted in the flow of water everywhere and it was out of control.” \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \n“It [Nepal] must move away from merely paying lip service to the ideals of achieving equality for all but take a concrete human rights-centric approach to relegating descent-based discrimination to the dustbins of history.” These are the powerful words of Fernanda Doz Costa, Amnesty International’s director of the gender and racial discrimination programme, at the launch of Amnesty International Nepal’s report on Dalits on May 10, 2024. Researched in 2023, the report is entitled ‘“No-one Cares”: Descent-Based Discrimination Against Dalits’.In this column, I analyse the report, focusing on its strengths and limitations while appreciating its potential value for the Dalit freedom struggle.A useful exercise All the talk about human rights and justice appears hollow in today’s world as we watch the horrifying images of the Israeli forces slaughtering tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians—many of them women and children—with total impunity. Even the United Nations has failed to stop this genocide.One wonders, then, what difference the voice of any human rights organisation or movement would make in any way, anywhere at all. While the concerns of international human rights organisations like Amnesty International may practically mean nothing for rich and powerful countries with powerful blind supporters like Israel, they could still prove useful in powerless and donor-dependent countries like ours. Here, Western governments and agencies have a degree of leverage, which could be utilised to liberate the suppressed masses. I, therefore, commend the organisation for carrying out this research on the largely forgotten caste discrimination issue. If anything, this report helps amplify voices against the persistent suffering of the Dalits and the total apathy of the state and non-state actors, both at the national and international levels. The study’s findings are largely consistent with the everyday experiences of most Dalits across the country and, to some extent, in the diaspora communities too. Additionally, the Amnesty report gives a set of specific and notable recommendations to the federal parliament, the prime minister’s office, the home ministry, as well as to the National Human Rights Commission, the Dalit Commission and UN agencies to take Dalit issues seriously and take appropriate measures to tackle them. Indeed, silence and inaction have persisted for too long while Dalits continue to be killed, injured, raped, humiliated and excluded; caste bigotry and hate are on the rise. And, as the report rightly suggests, Dalit women and girls have suffered the most. The report’s findings and recommendations can help Dalit activists raise their voices and garner wider support and solidarity for their cause. It could become a catalyst for generating greater interest in the issue and reviving and revitalising the Dalit movement, which has become dormant over the years. Forgotten religion and culture The Amnesty report repeatedly asks Nepali authorities not to limit Dalit problems to criminalisation and to find a more holistic solution. Unfortunately, the report itself lacks a nuanced or holistic analysis. Too much emphasis on impunity and an unresponsive legal and judicial system overshadows the bigger picture. The analysis is shallow, as religion and culture, the tectonic plates that move the whole thing, have been ignored. The report does occasionally mention the “Hindu caste system” but refrains from delving into it. This is a wrong approach because the fundamental underlying cause of the persistence and prevalence of caste discrimination is the Hindu religion and culture. I don’t state this as a scholar or an activist; ask any non-political and ordinary Dalit person, and the facts will become clear. In the everyday experience of the Dalits, including many Dalit leaders and activists themselves, caste-based humiliation and exclusion are based on their ritually polluted status. Lack of access to power, poverty, illiteracy and other factors are secondary. As we sometimes see in news reports, even mayors and ward or municipal chairs in many parts of the country face caste-based exclusion. I’m sure many Dalit lawmakers themselves would struggle to rent property in Kathmandu because the landlords fear offending their ancestral spirits and other deities through contact with the ritually polluted! Herein lies the root of the problem: Nepalis are highly religious and spiritual people who live in constant fear and awe of their gods, their lineage deities, and the spirit of their dead ancestors. There is a strong belief that any transgression of the traditional ritual hierarchy based on caste would offend the supernatural powers, thereby causing death and destruction in the family and community. Caste is so sacred that many Nepalis would rather go to jail or even die than flout certain caste rules and “invite” the terrible wrath of their gods or deceased relatives. For these fundamentalists, state laws and law enforcement hardly mean anything.Why has there been a surge in attacks against the Dalits in recent years? Why don’t many police officers, administrators and judges take the caste discrimination issue seriously? Why do prime ministers and ministers and legislators turn a deaf ear to Dalit voices for change? Why have Dalit activists themselves not been very effective in defending their rights? All these questions can be answered with just two words: Religion and culture. There is a contradiction between state laws and religious/cultural laws. Today’s policemen and judges probably don’t need to be preached about universal human rights, but they also cannot deny their long-standing cultural and spiritual beliefs and practices of keeping their castes sacred. If religio-cultural traditions have greatly ‘caste-ified’ our social psychology, how can those in legal and judicial power positions be immune from it? This is the crux of the problem that needs unpacking by all sides.Problem with methodology?I understand the sensitivities surrounding religion and culture in any country or society. I don’t know why the Amnesty report remained silent on these complex yet vital issues. However, I suspect part of the problem lies in the research methodology itself. If you want new insights into any topic, you must involve and work with the younger generation. During the report’s launch, I saw the same old faces of Dalit activists and lawyers. I don’t mean to undermine their ongoing and historical contribution, but the new and younger generation also deserves a voice. The report was prepared with support from and consultation with Dalit non-governmental organisations that have long been commanded by the same old people. Moreover, they are usually connected to a political party, and upper-caste leaders invariably control every party. No wonder, mainstream Dalit discourse is still shy about putting religion and culture in the spotlight. The report itself makes it amply clear that the Dalit movement thus far has been toothless and that there is a need for new ways of tackling the problem. However, to show a new direction for freedom fighters and organise a paradigm shift, international players must move beyond their usual consultation with the same old activists and groups and find new kids on the block. Talking directly with the ordinary Dalits instead of through mediation with established groups would make ground realities apparent.  \nThe Government of Nepal is hosting an international dialogue titled “Mountains, People, and Climate Change” on May 22-23, 2024, in Kathmandu. The event aims to strengthen coordination and prioritise mountain-centric priorities and actions within the broader context of climate change. By convening mountain-based scientists, policymakers and practitioners, this dialogue will drive the ongoing efforts to position mountains as a pivotal element of the global agenda and as a key negotiation block within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Mountains are critical to both nature and humanity, offering essential ecological services. They are home to 15 percent of the global population and nearly half of the world's biodiversity hotspots. More than a third of the global population depends on freshwater sourced from mountains, with the Himalayan region alone supplying water to approximately 240 million people living in mountainous areas and over 1.6 billion people downstream. These regions deliver unique ecosystem services, including provisioning (food, water, medicines, energy), regulating (air quality, carbon storage, water filtration, pollution and disease control), supporting (habitat for wildlife, nutrient cycling) and cultural (tourism, recreation, education, spiritual well-being and indigenous knowledge).Despite their global significance, mountains face unprecedented environmental threats, primarily from climate change, air pollution, heat, drought, erratic rainfall and snowfall patterns. The rate of warming in mountain areas is disproportionately higher than in the plains. Projections indicate that the average temperature in the mountains could rise by over 1.8 degrees Celsius by 2050, while global efforts aim to cap warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Additionally, glacial lake outburst floods pose perennial threats, with current emission pathways suggesting that 80 percent of the glacier’s volume could disappear by 2100. Over two-thirds of indigenous mountain species are at risk of extinction, and mountain economies, which heavily rely on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, tourism and hydropower, are particularly vulnerable.The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report confirms that climate change and climate-induced disasters negatively impact mountain livelihoods, leading to resource degradation, declining production and the displacement of people, along with their cultural heritage and practices. Losses and damages, which are inevitable and unequally distributed, disproportionately affect developing countries and vulnerable groups such as low socio-economic classes, migrant groups, the elderly, women and children.Given their vulnerability, it is urgent and imperative to prioritise the mountain agenda in global climate change discussions to ensure the provision of resources, capacity and technology. Although global advocacy for mountains has gained momentum through various initiatives, like the “Mountain Partnership,” this agenda has yet to be fully acknowledged and integrated into global environmental negotiations, including UNFCCC decisions. Mountains and the cryosphere were discussed at COP26, but these discussions could not get momentum to influence decision-making significantly.Nepal has prioritised mountain and climate change issues since preparing its National Adaptation Programme of Actions (NAPA) in 2010. Building on previous initiatives, the Government of Nepal began systematically advocating for the mountain agenda in national and global forums last year. This advocacy gained momentum following UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's visit to Nepal, witnessing the disastrous impacts of climate change on the mountains and calling for immediate action. The agenda has been further pronounced by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in COP28, most notably in the high-level roundtable on “Call of the Mountains: Who Saves us from the Climate Crisis?”, which demanded a dialogue on mountains and climate change.This concerted effort culminated at COP28—where the importance of mountain ecosystems was acknowledged—led to the decision to hold an expert dialogue on mountains and climate change during the 60th sessions of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) scheduled for June 2024. The expert dialogue will provide space for scientists, policymakers and frontline communities to come together and share knowledge, experience and insights on strengthening the resilience of mountain ecosystems.Considering the opportunities to accelerate the mountain agenda in the forthcoming 60th sessions of the UNFCCC in June 2024, the Government of Nepal is hosting an international expert dialogue on mountains, people and climate change. Through this dialogue, Nepal aims to strengthen solidarity and prioritise mountain-based actions for climate justice, develop concrete roadmaps and foster collaboration among mountainous countries to address their shared vulnerabilities to climate change. This includes exploring and exchanging knowledge, research, and innovative solutions to promote partnerships concerning technology transfer, capacity development, and climate finance. This initiative aligns with broader goals of justice for nature and the preservation of human civilisation. By addressing these critical issues in a humane and equitable manner, the dialogue seeks to ensure that mountain communities do not bear an undue burden of global environmental changes and can continue to contribute to the richness of our global ecological and cultural landscapes.Ultimately, the dialogue aims to create a shared platform that not only raises awareness but also promotes collaboration across nations to foster a common understanding and unified position on the pressing issues facing mountainous regions.Expectations from the mountainous countries for the forthcoming international negotiations are resolutely centred on forging robust partnerships for climate justice. We urge that keeping the global temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius is vital for mountains, ecosystems and people. Delivering adequate, predictable and accessible funds and technology is urgent to support science-based locally-led climate actions. The full operationalisation of loss and damage funds in a transparent and equitable way is necessary to compensate for economic and non-economic losses in the mountains. Likewise, we want to see the global and domestic policies and plans put the most vulnerable women, youth, children, disabled people, indigenous people and local communities in the mountains at the priority of climate action. The global community should transform dialogue into decisive action, ensuring that concerted efforts provide sustainable and equitable benefits to all, preserving the delicate balance of mountain environments for future generations. \nRice prices are surging in Nepal. Last July, India, the world’s largest rice exporter, banned the export of widely consumed non-Basmati white rice. There are similar restrictions—either a complete ban or allocation of export quotas through high duties on exports—on the export of wheat, sugar and onion. Ahead of the national elections being held over almost seven weeks from April 19, India was probably aiming at bringing down domestic prices by increasing supplies. Earlier this month, the southern neighbour lifted the ban on onion export—in effect since last December—but with a minimum export price of $550 per tonne, which traders fear could exert upward pressure on prices in Nepal. As a nation increasingly reliant on Indian imports to fill domestic gaps in, let us say, onion supply, Nepal may just be an unintended victim, but this also lays bare the unbalanced nature of its trade balance. India is Nepal’s largest trade partner. In the last fiscal year through mid-July 2023, Nepal ran a trade deficit of Rs1,455 billion, of which Rs921 billion—or over 63 percent of the total—was attributed to India. The next largest deficit, Rs221 billion, or just over 15 percent, was with China. India also made up just over 64 percent of Nepal’s merchandise trade at Rs1,769 billion, with China a distant second at under 13 percent. Simply put, the Nepal-India trade relationship is dangerously lopsided.The cultural, religious, societal and other ties between India and Nepal go back to history. Topographically, the southern border is plain and, therefore, porous. In contrast, Nepal’s border to the north with China’s Tibet is harsh, mountainous and has inadequate road connections. For a landlocked nation, over time, Nepal’s trade reliance on India became the path of least resistance. This should hardly come as a surprise. What is surprising is the prevailing deteriorating trend. Until not too long ago, Nepal used to be self-sufficient in staples like rice. However, it is no longer so. Importantly, nearly all its petroleum needs are fulfilled by India. This kind of dependence can give any nation the temptation to take undue advantage. Protectionism: Pros and consLast month, 17 truckloads of India-bound Nepali tea were stopped by Indian customs for five days on the eastern border, citing a Commerce Ministry circular to mandatorily conduct lab tests on all tea imports from Nepal; previously, tests were done on five to 20 percent of Nepali tea. Ilam’s tea is a competitor to Darjeeling’s. Nepali traders also complain of India’s anti-dumping duties—which are levied on imported goods believed to be priced below fair market value—as one of the primary reasons for a decline over the years in Nepali readymade jute products. Repeated requests, including by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his India visit last year, to lift the duties have fallen on deaf ears. Anti-dumping duties are protectionist by nature. The importing countries believe they are facing unfair competition from imports, so they are trying to protect their own jobs and industries. The World Trade Organization does allow anti-dumping measures if it is determined that dumping is occurring. But these duties can be equally abused as a means of protecting inefficient industries and thereby stifling market competition. The importing countries routinely try to find ways to inflate the duties imposed. In jute’s case, it is ironic that Indian consumers will end up paying more. In Nepal’s eyes, India is being protectionist. India will probably argue it is levelling the playing field.Protectionism comes in many shades—primarily tariffs, quotas and subsidies. They are all aimed at defending domestic companies by making foreign goods more expensive or scarce. It is practised globally. Nowhere is this more visible currently than in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. China has ascended quickly to become the largest producer and exporter of these vehicles. There are nearly 100 EV companies there. The Chinese government’s subsidies—direct (cash incentives) or indirect (interest-free loans, tax breaks, among others)—to solar panels, EVs and lithium-ion batteries are well-known. Overcapacity at home forces these manufacturers to look for opportunities abroad, stoking trade tensions.The right industrial policyFor consumers, this means lower prices. In the March quarter, China’s BYD—known for its affordable four-wheelers—surpassed Tesla to become the top seller of EVs globally. But for the US and European auto manufacturers, with decades of history and leadership, it translates to fear that they will be priced out. In the past, Europe used to lead in solar panel production; the industry was decimated by Chinese competition. Autos are a sensitive issue politically in both Europe and the United States. Both Brussels and Washington have repeatedly raised the issue of overcapacity in China and how this likely overwhelms factories in their countries. As an antidote, tariffs on Chinese EVs increasingly look likely.A few Chinese EV companies are already building factories in Mexico, which is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement. This comes at a time when the US itself is incentivising domestic production of EVs, EV batteries, chips, etc., which it views as strategic. China, in fact, recently filed a complaint with the WTO contesting discriminatory subsidy policies for EVs under the Joe Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act—one of three major investment bills passed since November 2021 with billions of dollars in loans, grants and tax credits targeted at reviving the country’s productivity, innovation and manufacturing base. Risks of tariffs are forcing companies to start producing in the US. Tariffs run the risk of provoking counter-tariffs. For a tiny country like ours, which is trade-dependent on its big neighbours, these dynamics are different. Using the case of jute as an example, there is nothing Nepal can do about it except take it lying down. Nepal imports most of the raw jute used to make jute products from India and Bangladesh, so there is no competitive advantage. It is a cliché, but it is also worth repeating. The policymakers should strive for an industrial policy that promotes products with a competitive edge and stick to it no matter who occupies Singha Durbar. It is equally important for Nepal to devote resources to finding alternative markets. \nAs the midsummer mercury rises, storing fresh food remains a challenge. In a country where the usage of refrigerators remains limited to urban areas, there is a risk of food getting contaminated. Moreover, our general attitude towards food safety and preservation, especially in eateries, is casual. For instance, we see meat shops openly displaying raw meat items all day on tables and showcases, without the use of freezers. Sweet shops and restaurants are no better, as they are tempted to display their food items to attract customers. Even though the food might look appealing to our eyes when it is served in eateries, it is ultimately harmful to our health as many do not follow the proper food safety protocols. The open display of food items invites bacteria and dust contamination, apart from the obvious heat-related hazards, leading to the onslaught of various diseases, including cholera and food poisoning, apart from a lack of nutrition. Although Nepal has food safety regulations in place, the lack of implementation and monitoring continues to pose the risk of food-borne diseases to the public. The Food Act, 2023 (1967) prohibits the production, sale or distribution of adulterated foodstuff or sub-standard foodstuff. By adulterated foodstuff, the Act means \"foodstuffs rotten so as to be harmful to health, or prepared or kept in a filthy or toxic condition\". In January last year, Nepal implemented a new set of food safety regulations, which has provisions for the careful production, processing, packaging, handling, storage and supply purity of food. The regulations also have provisions for labelling the food, including its nutritional value.However, apart from poor implementation of such regulations, the monitoring of the regulations is almost non-existent. In rare instances when food inspectors from municipalities bother to monitor the food in eateries, there is a high chance of such eateries being found flouting the regulations. For instance, in Kathmandu, as in most parts of the country, food items, especially items like meat that get contaminated quickly, are laid out in the open and sold. This causes great health risks, but the authorities of all levels of government seem either oblivious to or uninterested in the issue. In Kathmandu Metropolitan City, for instance, the authorities' focus is on removing the food vendors altogether, guided by a flawed notion of gentrification rather than regulating them under tax and food safety regimes. In other parts of the country, hardly anyone bothers to check the quality of food provided to customers.The state cannot remain a mute spectator when the health of the citizens is put at risk due to the carelessness of vendors. Rather, the state should strictly maintain food safety standards regularly—not in an episodic pattern, such as during festivals or at the whims of authorities but as a standard practice. Some basic steps include making it mandatory for vendors to keep appropriate food items in freezers, use covering, and segregate food items to avoid cross-contamination. As the culture of eating out is becoming increasingly common, especially among young people, the state should actively enforce food preservation and safety regulations to keep the citizens healthy. \n20 arrest warrants issued in Nepal Children's Organization land lease scam investigation involving former office bearers and business representatives.\nKedar Karki's unsteady hold on power in Koshi Province ends after coalition partners withdraw support, highlighting the decline of democratic values in Nepali politics and the power grab prevalent in provinces.\nThe United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal discusses Nepal's sociopolitical changes, LDC graduation challenges, SDG progress, Investment Summit support, development cooperation framework, climate change impacts, peace process status, and Nepal's role in UN and other global platforms amidst global polarization.\nThe upcoming budget session of Nepal's federal parliament faces uncertainty due to ongoing disputes over forming a committee to investigate allegations against Deputy Prime Minister Rabi Lamichhane, with the government aiming to pass crucial bills and improve parliament's productivity.\nNumerous fire incidents in various districts have displaced people, caused property loss, and resulted in nine fatalities, highlighting the inadequacy of current fire prevention measures due to insufficient rainfall, increased temperatures, and wind conditions.\nNepal's third Investment Summit aims to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by presenting investment opportunities, addressing obstacles from previous summits, and promoting Nepal's investor-friendly environment through legal amendments, simplified profit repatriation, and a focus on energy and hydropower.\nPolitical parties’ unhealthy activities to form provincial governments has taken the form of an ugly competition and increased the public’s frustration with the provinces. Separately, leaders of major political parties have started to blame the mixed electoral system for Nepal’s perpetual instability. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to political analyst Tula Narayan Shah to discuss these and other related issues.Nepali politics has entered yet another phase of endless bickering over power after the March 4 change of the ruling coalition. Politicians have resorted to every possible tactic to get leadership in provincial governments. How do you analyse this trend?I am not surprised. It is natural in the kind of parliamentary system that we practise. We adopted the parliamentary model in federal and provincial levels while the one at our local level is similar to the presidential system. Local unit chiefs and deputies are elected directly by the people and they can serve five-year terms. That has ensured stability there. Provincial governments on the other hand are destabilised when there is any change at the centre.Leaders have started blaming the electoral system for hung parliaments and instability. Is the problem in the system or with our leaders?Some senior leaders in major parties now blame the electoral system. Even the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Office of the Auditor General have recommended changes in the electoral model, arguing that the current one had promoted corruption in the country. I am not convinced. Politicians argue that no political party could garner a majority in this system and that led to instability. I rather hold politicians’ personal ambition and corrupt political culture responsible. General secretary of a major political party recently argued that it will be better for national politics to be driven by two political parties. Nepal conducted eight general elections (in 1959, in 1991, in 1994, in 1999, in 2008, in 2013, in 2017 and in 2022) under a multi-party system. Forget the 1959 polls. Of the three polls held in the 1990s, the Nepali Congress got majority in 1991 and 1999. Also, during those years, two parties—the Congress and the CPN-UML—dominated Nepali politics. Did a single-party majority and dominance of two parties provide stability? Not at all. Rather, personal rivalries of the Congress leaders invited instability. Fast forward to 2017 elections. The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance and jointly fought elections. They later merged to form the Nepal Communist Party, which had a comfortable majority. Again the rivalry of the top leaders within the party caused instability. These instances show that a majority for a single party doesn’t necessarily translate into stability.I rather see a conspiracy behind blaming the electoral system. In the 1990s, Nepal adopted the first-past-the-post system to elect all lawmakers. Around 70 percent national seats were controlled by two castes—Brahmin and Chhetri. In 2008, we adopted a mixed electoral system, which was a demand of the 2006 people’s movement, the Maoist insurgency and the Madhesh agitation. The proportional representation category significantly increased representation of women, dalits, Madheshi and indigenous communities in the legislature, whereas the representation of the males of Khas-Arya groups, who were historically ruling the country, decreased drastically.Who are those elected the most under the FPTP system?The FPTP electoral system has certain attributes that are more conducive to some groups than others. ‘High-caste males’ win more elections. Females have less of a chance. But dalits also have less chance even if the candidate is male. Those like contractors, landlords and businesspeople who can freely spend win elections. Likewise, those who are well-connected with the power centres in Kathmandu can influence elections. Chhetris and Thakuris were dominant in Panchayat politics. Brahmins got stronger after the 1990 political change. Also those who have access and visibility in media and other public forums have better chances of being elected under the FPTP.Some leaders who have these capabilities have won elections in different systems. There is one Madheshi leader, who won election in Panchayat, got tickets from Congress and won again in the multiparty system. Later he joined a Madhesh-based party and won. So, high-caste males and those with access to power corridors in Kathmandu want FPTP. Whereas, women, dalits and those from marginalised communities prefer PR.A general perception is that those who are directly elected are competent ones and can deliver whereas those from the PR category are there just for the sake of representation. Do you agree?Leaders didn’t pick the candidates properly under the PR category. They picked their loved or loyal ones or sold these seats for hefty monetary returns. Leaders from Madheshi and indigenous communities fought for this system. But the same Madheshi leaders kept the names of their wives, daughters and other family members at the top of the PR list. Thus leaders misused and defamed the electoral system. So, the debate should be focused on correcting the wrong practices, not scrapping the system itself.Provinces replicated all the wrong practices of the centre and did even worse.We adopted the same parliamentary system in provinces. So the same thing happened there. Conversely, local units are different as the system there is different. Therefore, we have to go for directly elected executive heads at the centre as well as provinces. Let’s elect the prime minister and chief ministers directly. That will give us stability. Senior leaders from the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre have proposed changing the electoral system but they haven’t proposed direct election of the prime minister and chief ministers. So, the solution is direct election of executive heads, as in Palikas. Scrapping of the PR system won’t help.What if a wrong person gets elected to the post and can’t be removed for five years?In a democracy, you have to trust the people. Nepali citizens are the ones who removed monarchy. Can’t they unseat a leader elected by their votes? In a direct election, even a person from outside the political parties may emerge. So, politicians are afraid because traditionally they exert control over candidacy and various other things through the parties. Many think of provinces as an unnecessary burden on state coffers. Is that the case?I don’t think so. State restructuring was one of the major demands of the Maoist insurgency, Madhesh movement and the 2006 People’s Movement. Why did they ask for it? Because Nepal was a heavily centralised state and it wasn’t inclusive. Federalisation of the state, inclusive electoral system and reservation quotas in civil service were the three components of state restructuring.But why did the provinces then fail to deliver and win public trust?The stakeholders spent around a decade deciding what type of provinces should be carved out. Even pro-federalists didn’t debate how to make the provinces functional. Those who lobbied in favour of the federal system have now become defensive. Some are silent. The political party [which is led by Upendra Yadav] that fought for the federal system has been leading the government in Madhesh for the past six years. But they haven’t given any relief to the common people through the provincial government. People have an impression that the provincial system has added corruption and it is only for the leaders and their cronies, not the common people.Are the leaders really corrupt or do they lack efficiency?Even the Maoist and Madheshi parties that promised to be different to the Congress and the UML couldn’t come up with a roadmap to make the federal system and state agencies more meaningful for the people. They only indulged in power politics, just like other parties. That frustrated the people.You recently travelled to various parts of Madhesh province. How are the sub-national administrations working and what is the public mood there?A society where people are aware, educated and active helps make leaders as well as administration accountable. Authorities are found to be working arbitrarily in the places where people can’t question their wrongdoing. We find relatively better administration in the mid-hill regions, where Brahmins and Chhetris have dominant presence as they have better understanding of the system, laws and other information. Such a mid-hill area expands from the eastern border to Lumbini Province. In this belt, people can raise questions and make the administration accountable. Women’s status is better while caste-based discrimination is less. Local units, schools, health posts, and administrative units work well. Conversely, these aspects are weak in Karnali, Sudurpaschim, inner Madhesh and in the northern belt as there is no critical mass capable of questioning the authorities.You should understand that there are two Madhesh belts. One is along the East-West Highway, second is the bordering area. The belt along the highway has a diverse social composition. There is dominance of the people who migrated from the hills. Development indicators are better and so is the presence of state agencies. The more you move south, the more you find homogenous populations of Madheshi origin. Traditional power relations haven’t changed there. Patron-client dynamics still stand. Certain individuals have key roles in elections and other important activities. They take the decision on behalf of other common people. We find similar practice in the northern belt as well but not in the mid-hill and highway areas.Many say local units perform better than provinces. What is the perception on the ground?Local level is equipped with needed authority. Provinces should be given powers to make them effective as per the spirit of federalism. The present system was designed by reluctant federalists. Therefore, what we need is a fresh debate on the reforms of provinces. There are two conflicting claims. A section of the society says provinces have misused their authority and failed to deliver. Others say the provinces need more authority for effective functioning.It is true that provinces have failed to use the authority they have. Provinces have their legislatures that prepare their budgets and their governments can implement it. Give me an example of an exemplary and innovative initiative taken by any of the seven provinces in the past six years. Madhesh Province started the ‘Beti Padhau Beti Bachau’ campaign but corruption doomed it. People started raising questions, “why do we need provinces, if the leaders there are to copy the same corrupt activities of the centre?”Madheshi leaders opposed the hill people’s dominance and discriminatory practices in the central administration. But the same Madheshi leaders aren’t promoting an inclusive system in Madhesh. Around 20 percent of the total Madhesh population are dalits. The government in the province has changed multiple times. But how many dalits have been ministers in the provincial Cabinets? There are 136 local units in Madhesh Province. But only one mayor and two deputy-mayors are from the dalit community. Just like a set of elite people has captured Kathmandu’s politics, another set of elites has captured the politics of Janakpur.How do Madheshi people look at provinces?People in Kathmandu, mid-hills, and some other places can be heard saying provinces should be scrapped. Common people in Madhesh don’t say so. But they have dissatisfaction with the parties who championed the federal system. They say, “our lives are the same even in the federal system”.How do you analyse the performance of two new parties in Madhesh—Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti?Overall, three parties emerged from the 2022 elections. The Rastriya Swatantra Party emerged from the areas with a dominant presence of hill people. The Janamat Party won from eastern Tarai and the Nagarik Unmukti Party from the western part of the southern belt. The Janamat says the agenda of discrimination against Madhesh is still relevant but they oppose the leadership of the Janata Samajbadi Party and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The old Madheshi parties spoke against Kathmandu’s discrimination but they themselves didn’t work to remove discrimination when they led the government in Madhesh. Besides, they didn’t speak against bad governance. Now, the Janamat’s agenda is to fight discrimination and bad governance, both by Kathmandu as well as the old Madheshi parties.The RSP’s emergence is against “the bad governance of the Congress and the UML”. Its major agenda is good governance. It doesn’t care about discrimination. But bad governance isn’t an agenda of Nagarik Unmukti. The party that emerged mainly after the Tikapur incident is against the discrimination of Tharu community. The dispute in the party is family-based and the outfit hasn’t taken the form of a political party. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nSinohydro refutes a news report claiming they failed to pay taxes on construction materials for the Melamchi Water Supply Project; they used legal sources and recycled materials, and have paid all vendors and suppliers.\nJapan's labor market opened to Nepali workers in 2019, but there are misunderstandings regarding government involvement, the role of agencies, and financial responsibilities that require clarification.\nMichael Hutt expresses gratitude for Deepak Thapa's concerns about Nepali studies in Euro-America, acknowledges Krishna Pradhan's contributions at SOAS, and laments the decline of Nepali studies in the UK due to Pradhan's retirement and the discontinuation of related courses.\nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPresident Ramchandra Paudel on Tuesday presented the government’s policies and programmes which incorporated many old programmes. The ruling alliance called the document a departure from norm while opposition parties said that there is nothing new in the document and so further discussion in Parliament is unnecessary.The 55-page document that set the priorities of the government also offered some new propositions which the opposition parties labelled ‘vague’ and ‘incomplete’. Paudel in his address said implementing the constitution, shoring up federalism and economy, and controlling corruption are the government's major priorities. The document also states that the scope of social welfare schemes will be expanded, 5,000 new jobs created in the information and technology sector, startup loans will be extended to 1,000 youths and installed capacity of hydropower projects in the country will be increased from the existing 2,940 megawatt to 4,500 megawatt. The government also invoked the slogan of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali” (Samriddha Nepal, Sukhi Nepali), the CPN-UML’s flagship initiative, in the policies and programmes. “There is no need to discuss the document,” said Nepali Congress spokesman and former finance minister Prakash Sharan Mahat. “There is nothing new here.”But the ruling parties praised the document and claimed that it lays the platform for an economic march. “Compared to the previous policies and programmes, today’s document has some new features,” said Swarnim Wagle, a parliamentarian from the Rastriya Swatantra Party. Wagle is a noted economist who earlier served as the vice-chairman of the National Planning Commission.The government has emphasised promotion of good governance, streamlining public services, and establishing a citizen-friendly governance system, said Paudel, while announcing 2024-2034 as a decade devoted to promoting agriculture. He said the investment of public, private, cooperatives and development sectors in the agricultural sector will be increased. He also announced that programmes in agriculture will be restructured so as to make the country self-sufficient, mainly in food and vegetables.In his speech, the President said the government is committed to attracting private capital and bringing foreign investment. The government will work towards boosting the morale of industrialists and businesspersons, the President said.As the country is grappling with an unprecedented cooperatives crisis, the government has proposed setting up a powerful tribunal as well as an effective loan recovery mechanism and a regulatory body to oversee the sector.“The document does not address the concerns and grievances of the people and issues raised by the opposition parties,” said Mahat, the Congress spokesperson. “The government has merely performed its duty and maintained the tradition of presenting the annual policies and programmes in Parliament.”Reading out the document, Paudel said the government will soon launch a sovereign credit rating system in order to attract foreign investment, claiming that 98 percent of the population now has access to electricity and that the export of electricity to India and Bangladesh has been assured.An agreement was reached between Nepal and India last December to export 10,000 megawatts of electricity in 10 years.There has as yet been no formal agreement between Nepal and Bangladesh to export electricity to Bangladesh using India's transmission infrastructure. But the per unit price of electricity to be exported to Bangladesh has been agreed. Paudel said special emphasis will be on building hospitals in local units. In 2021, the then KP Sharma Oli-led government had also announced plans to build at least one hospital in every local unit and initiated the process to construct 396 hospitals. Progress on most of them, however, is dismal. Paudel said that health insurance has been extended to all local governments.Despite the widened reach of the health insurance programme, people's participation in it has not increased. Worse, those who bought the insurance scheme in the past did not renew it because of low coverage.The government aims to expedite work on national pride projects such as Sikta, Babai, Ranijmara-Kularia, Bheri-Babai and Sunkoshi-Marin diversion multi-purpose projects. An Integrated Karnali Irrigation Development Programme will be implemented in Karnali Province. Other programmes of water resource conservation are replenishment of aquifers and construction of ponds to expand irrigation schemes.“This year, unlike previous years, you will see good compatibility and correlation between the policies and programmes and the budget,” said Wagle, the parliamentarian. “This year, we are not going to talk about big things but want to bring incremental changes in several sectors.”The idea is to incorporate some new programmes and effect changes in every ministry, said Wagle. “The policies and programmes have been so designed. This is a departure from the previous policies and programmes,” he added.The government also announced the “President Climate Change Management Programme” to address the effects of climate change in the mountains, hills and the plains in an integrated manner.The document promises to implement the national policy and action plan for mitigating the effects of climate change, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction. There is a plan to establish Nepal’s leading role in internationalising the impact of climate change on the Himalayan regions, according to the document. The government has also proposed a specialised body for the supervision and regulation of credit cooperatives. It is also the government’s policy, says the document, to protect the savings and investment of the cooperative sector through the Cooperative Savings and Credit Protection Fund, the Cooperative Credit Information Centre and the Cooperative Debt Recovery Tribunal. The identification of poor households would be completed within the next financial year. The government also proposes reviving sick firms, routinely like many previous such documents. ‘The prime minister’s self-reliance programme for daughters’ has received much attention both in and outside Parliament.“From forestry to resource mobilisation to poverty reduction to irrigation, we are following the same old path,” said a government secretary, requesting anonymity. “The real challenge is improving the country’s overall economic status. Micro-level economic indicators of every household in the country are bleak, people are leaving their businesses and jobs, and are going abroad but the government’s policies and programmes do not address these woes in any way.”Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said the government has brought a good list of policies and programmes and there would be enough links between them and the national budget. Speaking to the reporters after the President presented the document, he said a new budget would be tabled in line with the document. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel delivered the government's policies and programmes on Tuesday after the Nepali Congress lifted the obstruction in the House of Representatives. However, the disruption continued afterwards.President Paudel read out the policies and programmes of the government in the joint sitting of the federal parliament.The Congress then blocked the proceedings of both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly and did not let the assembly table a motion of expressing gratitude to the President for delivering the government’s annual paper.It is customary for Parliament to thank the President for reading out the annual policies and programmes. The parliamentary party meeting of the Congress on Tuesday morning, however, had decided not to allow Parliament to proceed after the head of state wraps up his presentation.The Congress later responded that the policies and programmes fail to address the problems of cooperatives’ victims. The main opposition has been protesting in Parliament, demanding a parliamentary probe into the issue of cooperatives around the country embezzling the deposits of hundreds of thousands of depositors. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane is the focus of the largest party’s fury for his alleged involvement in the cooperative scam. “Our position that the government has protected the people who have swindled cooperatives victims has been reconfirmed,” said Ramesh Lekhak, the chief whip of the Congress party, while talking to the media after the policies and programmes had been read out.The main opposition party was initially not ready to allow the smooth operation of the Parliament’s proceedings. The party even warned the government and the ruling partners that it would prevent President Paudel from presenting the government's policies and programmes should its demand go unheeded.The Congress has been disrupting Parliament, demanding a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane over allegations of cooperative funds embezzlement. Lamichhane has publicly refuted the charges and asked for a chance to make his case clear in Parliament.But the Congress has been preventing Lamichhane from speaking in the House. The Congress, which appeared tough against the resumption of parliamentary business, even the presidential appearance, had relented and agreed to let the President present the programmes. But it resorted to the obstruction soon after. In 2017, the CPN-UML, while in the opposition, had been obstructing parliamentary proceedings. It allowed then-President Bidya Devi Bhandari to present the annual policies. The opposition then protested the Cabinet’s decision to increase the number of local federal units in the Tarai in the midst of the elections. The party later obstructed the motion of thanks to the President.During Speaker Devraj Ghimire’s meeting with the party chief whips on Tuesday afternoon, before the President read out the government’s annual document, the Congress had announced its plan to continue to disrupt the House after the policies had been presented.“We will continue to interrupt the House until our demand is addressed,” Congress whip Sushila Thing told the Post. “As there is no parliamentary practice of barring the head of state to present policies and programmes, we too didn’t go that uncharted route.”The party will not allow other proceedings of the two houses for as long as it takes in order to get its demands addressed, Thing said.On Tuesday morning, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa and the party’s Chief Whip Lekhak met Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to discuss the issue of parliamentary obstruction. Dahal had requested the Congress leaders to allow a smooth functioning of the legislature. The Congress leaders also claimed that the prime minister seemed positive about addressing their demand.“While meeting our leaders, the prime minister seemed positive but he has not taken the necessary steps to honour the call of the main opposition,” Congress whip Thing said. Dahal’s openness to the formation of the probe committee was one of the reasons the Congress became ready to allow the President to present the policies and programmes. Shakti Basnet, the minister of energy, water resources and irrigation, claimed that the discussion between the government and Congress was headed in a positive direction.“Until late Monday night, the Congress was adamant on barring the President from presenting the policies and programmes. But on Tuesday, we reached an agreement to allow the President to do so,” Basnet, a Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, told the Post. “The government will similarly reach an agreement with the Congress on its demand for the probe committee.”According to the Congress leaders, Sunday's meeting between the prime minister and Congress leaders also concluded positively to address the party's demand. After the Congress leaders met Prime Minister Dahal, the party held the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday morning. The same meeting allowed President Paudel to confer the government's annual policies and programmes. The ruling parties and the main opposition have been discussing smooth operation of Parliament for the past few days. However, given the inflexible positions of both sides, Tuesday’s session was expected to face trouble.“The ruling parties and the opposition need to come to a logical conclusion to open the parliamentary business,” UML whip Sunita Baral told the Post. “It looks like both sides only have discussed the issue at their ease. What we need is negotiation to resolve the issues of both Parliament and the cooperative scam.”The constitution mandates the government to present its annual budget on Jestha 15 (May 28 this year). For this reason also, the ruling and opposition parties need to close their ranks, Baral added.The ruling parties are ready to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the issues plaguing the cooperative sector. However, they are reluctant to constitute a committee with the mandate to probe Lamichhane. The Congress, too, is positive about a broad inquiry into the cooperatives, but it deems investigating Lamichhane in particular a necessity after various probes by police and other government bodies established his involvement in the scams. The Congress had disrupted the winter session of Parliament before it was prorogued on April 14, with the same demand. The party has also been obstructing the new session of Parliament that commenced on May 10. \nClimate change has profound impacts on Nepal's economy, water resources, biodiversity, agriculture, and awareness, affecting households, health, education, and energy transition, with significant economic losses, emergence of new crop diseases, reduced water availability, awareness gaps, and impacts on disaster vulnerability.\nRecent heavy rainfall in Nepal has brought dengue cases to 57 districts, despite efforts to mitigate its spread due to budget limitations and a lack of entomologists, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach involving multiple ministries and public cooperation.\nNepal's budget for FY2024/25 is set for release, highlighting the need to address the imbalance in fiscal transfers, with decreasing fiscal equalisation grants and a disproportionate reliance on conditional grants at the local level.\nPolitical parties have evolved from relying on volunteers to corporate entities, fostering quid pro quo relationships with corporations for funding through electoral bonds, while social media has empowered parties to manipulate public perception with lavish ad spending, necessitating re-evaluation of political funding regulation.\nSenior leaders from seven major political parties pledge to promote investment, emphasizing the need for political stability and predictability.\nEducation in Every Home's report uncovers systemic bias and inaccuracies in Nepal's textbooks, with limited diversity, underrepresentation of marginalized groups, and erroneous historical claims.\nPartly cloudy weather prevails nationwide; light rainfall possible in Koshi and Gandaki provinces, snowfall possible in Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali high-altitude regions.\nPresident Ramchandra Paudel presented the government's policies for improved economy, foreign investment, and infrastructure development, including 98% electricity access and IT hub creation.\nNepal and South Korea signed an MoU to create jobs through recycling and upcycling projects in Pokhara, with Korea contributing USD9.8 million and UNDP implementing the project to establish a green venture zone, promote sustainable enterprises, and generate green jobs.\nDrones may start transporting garbage from Mount Everest, potentially reducing the dangers faced by human guides who currently navigate the hazardous Khumbu Icefall.\nAfter nearly a decade of infertility and loss, Anistha Shrestha adopted an abandoned baby boy in 2017, filling a crucial legal gap in Nepal's adoption process but exposing ongoing issues with regulation, safety, and societal barriers faced by the queer community.\nThe victory of Suhang Nembang, a political neophyte representing the CPN-UML, in Ilam-2 by-election may not have a big impact on the make-up of the federal parliament. But it nevertheless hints at the country’s general political landscape and, of course, of the Koshi Province, where identity politics had been all the rage in the lead-up to the election.The nomenclature of Koshi Province, of which Ilam is a district, had been a flashpoint of violent agitation led by the proponents of identity politics who wanted a name that reflected the ethnic identity of the place. Two activists from that front—Milan Limbu, representing the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and independent Dakendra Singh Limbu, who was part of the Province-1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee—were in the fray. So there was curiosity on how they would perform. While the latter came in third with 11,457 votes, the former’s electoral run ended rather dismally as he could not even protect his security deposit.The votes gained by Dakendra has undercut the claims of the major parties that voices for identity-based politics in the region were weakening, argues Govinda Chhantyal, who is among the activists who opposed the nomenclature of Koshi Province.“The number of votes independent candidate Dekendra Singh Limbu garnered in Ilam-2 bypoll has established identity-politics as a major agenda in the region,” Chhantyal told the Post. “Since the 2014 election, the agenda of identity politics has been subjugated. This by-election, however, has once again established it as a political agenda.”The election result has also given the emergent Rastriya Swatantra Party a reality check, experts say. The RSP has a long way to go if it is to establish itself as a major political force throughout the country, they say, as candidates of both the ‘traditional’ political parties, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, trumped all others.The Ilam-2 House of Representatives seat went vacant after former Speaker and vice-chair of UML Subas Chandra Nembang died of a heart attack in September last year.While Suhang, the late leader’s son, won the bypoll securing 27,772 votes, his closest competitor, Dambar Bahadur Khadka, of the Nepali Congress, obtained 21,942 against Dakendra Singh’s 11,457 and Milan Limbu’s 5,050.The result shows the old parties are very much in the fray.“It seems people still see the old parties as relevant given their robust networks at the grassroots, which RSP and independent candidates lacked,” Chiran Manandhar, who was one the observers of Ilam-2 election representing the Democracy Research Center Nepal, told the Post. “People who aspire to political patronage still find old parties relevant.”The RSP had created great buzz with their vigorous campaigning for the Ilam-2 seat. Their candidate Milan Limbu and the independent Dakendra Singh had challenged the traditional parties. Given the past votes obtained by the RSP in the 2022 election and the by-elections in Chitwan-2 and Tanahun-1 a year earlier, the party was expected to challenge the established forces this time, too. But that was not to be.After the poll results, RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane took to social media to thank all the voters and urged his party supporters to accept the outcome. “Thank you everyone who voted for us and also gave us a big message,” he said.Other RSP leaders have said that there were some shortcomings of the party while contesting the Ilam-2 seat, which they would review in the upcoming central committee meeting of the party.“We heeded the signal bell, albeit belatedly,” reads the statement released by party general secretary Mukul Dhakal after the results.The RSP, which emerged as the national political force in the November 2022 election, still has a long way to go before it becomes a major political party that can go toe to toe against the likes of the Congress and the UML, experts say. “It seems the RSP has some currency in the urban areas of the country, but when it comes to the countryside, they still need to work hard to establish a base,” Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political scientist, told the Post.For Bhatta, party president Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the cooperative scam is another reason why RSP could not perform well in Ilam-2.Lamichhane, who is also the deputy prime minister and minister of home affairs, has been accused in the cooperative fund embezzlement cases lodged in Kaski District Court and Rupandehi District Court. Lamichhane has been denying his involvement. \nNepal on Saturday hosted the first international LGBTIQ tourism conference. It wants a chunk of the multi-billion dollar pink market after the stunning success of a legally recognised same-sex marriage last November.“Forget Nepal’s biased history. Now, we aim at building more just and equitable societies. Let the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex or queer (LGBTIQ) get equal economic opportunity,” said Sunil Babu Pant, the first openly gay former parliamentarian in Asia, addressing the conference in Kathmandu.Just a few years back, police beating gay and transgender individuals in the streets used to be a common sight.“After fighting legal battles for nearly two decades, the law and the society have accepted the LGBTIQ community. Now we are in the second phase—we need equal economic opportunities. For this we need to bring LGBTIQ tourists from the global market.”The conference was announced following the successful marriage registration of Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung, the first same-sex couple to get legally recognised in Nepal, on November 29, 2023, after a years-long legal wrangling.This interim arrangement remains valid until the legal provisions are made.Their legally recognised same-sex marriage is the first of its kind in South Asia and marks a milestone for LGBTIQ rights.“It is a privilege to stand before you and reflect on a pivotal moment in my career, one that underscores the importance of justice, equality, and the pursuit of human rights,” said Supreme Court Justice Hari Prasad Phuyal, who in 2007 as a lawyer argued in favour of laws guaranteeing full rights of LGBTIQ people and in defining gender minorities as “natural persons” under the law. They had the right to marry, he argued. Eventually, in December 2007, the court issued a historic verdict ensuring the rights of the community.The verdict reads: “No one has the right to question how two adults perform sexual intercourse and whether this intercourse is natural or unnatural and that … the way the right to privacy is secured to two heterosexual individuals in sexual intercourse, it is equally secured to the people of third gender who have a different gender identity and sexual orientation.” “In 2007, I found myself entrusted with a case… by Sunil Babu Pant that would leave an indelible mark on my journey. At the helm of Blue Diamond Society, Sunil brought forth a case that demanded not just representation, but a profound understanding of the struggle faced by the LGBTIQ community,” said Phuyal.“Admittedly, my initial knowledge was limited on the issue, but through dedicated learning and unwavering commitment, I found the confidence to evoke it, and here we have it. The outcome, a resounding decision of the Supreme Court, stands as a backbone of hope and progress not only for Nepal but the world at large.“We recognise that the civil and political rights are fundamental, but so are economic, social and cultural rights.”He said that “rainbow tourism” not only promises economic growth but presents an opportunity to foster inclusion and empowerment in the LGBTIQ community. “By integrating them into the national economy, we not only create employment opportunities but also contribute to the overall prosperity of our nation.”He stressed that the decision made by Nepal’s Supreme Court is a precedent for other countries, including the neighbours. Diane Anderson-Minshall, CEO and chief storyteller of GO Magazine, in her presentation titled ‘LGBTI Tourism Global Overview and its Contribution to the Economy’, said that LGBTIQ or pink tourism are the segments of travellers that have a lot of wealth and purchasing power. According to her, based on the Wealth and Travel Data Report of LGBT Capital 2023, the global annual spending power of LGBTIQ consumers is $4.7 trillion. Among them, the Americans have a spending capacity of $1.4 trillion, followed by the Chinese at $872 billion, Germans at $224 billion, Indians at $168 billion and the British at $164 billion. China is an untapped market and that’s going to grow over the next several years. “And one of the things that we know from Chinese gay travellers is they are looking for places they feel safe, where they can hold hands and where they can have new experiences.”And those are things they'll find in Nepal, said Anderson-Minshall. Germany and the UK are the LGBTIQ capitals. Nandini Lahe-Thapa, director of the Nepal Tourism Board, said, “For Nepal’s tourism industry, the LGBTIQ conference is a triumph as this is one of the most important market segments that we have yet to tap.”To attract more tourists to spend more and stay longer, Nepal is following the principle of ‘tourism for all and the power for all seasons and all reasons’, said Lahe-Thapa. “And so we are very proud to partner with the first-ever Rainbow Tourism International Conferences.”People choose to travel to places where they feel safe, respected and can be themselves.“People might feel uncomfortable sharing their identity and choices if the place and the people are judgmental and unfriendly. Here we have an advantage as a destination,” said Lahe-Thapa.Nepal Tourism Board and the travel trade fraternity plan to capitalise on the potential of the pink community worldwide and have started investing in creating a more friendly and enabled environment to foster such tourism. Last year, the board organised a trekking guide training for 25 individuals from the LGBTIQ community.According to Pant, now there are several businesses owned by members of the LGBTIQ communities—with at least two dozen bars, restaurants, travel and tour operators and hotels in Kathmandu. “Businesses are opening up for the queer and that’s a good sign. We can promote Nepal as a same-sex marriage and honeymoon destination.”Nepal’s diverse culture includes rich LGBTIQ-related traditions. Exploring the country’s festivals, temples, symbols, rituals and stories, such as the concept of Ajima and the recognition of six genders, offers a unique cultural experience.Pant said that they have launched a ‘tantra heritage tour’ that provides an in-depth exploration of Nepal's culture and spiritual aspects, including those related to matriarchy and LGBTIQ communities.The pink community worldwide opens up a new segment of valuable visitors for Nepal.Veronique Lorenzo, the EU ambassador to Nepal, said, “For Nepal, this is the first of many happy journeys. I think this conference can play an important role in supporting Nepal’s economy and helping the LGBTIQ community with jobs and recognition. There's an array of benefits from this tourism segment.”“Nepal is a success story. It's the second country in Asia to have have registered same-sex marriage. Of course, there's still a lot of progress to be made. The fight has to go on every day to bring the legislative and legal frameworks in line with the evolution of society.”“It's not just about the pink money, it's also about promoting inclusiveness and being fair to travellers.”  \nRemittance-dependent Nepal may face a dizzying sequence of shocks, particularly in the labour market, due to escalating tensions in the Middle East following Iran's attack on Israel on Saturday, experts have warned.Reports show that Tehran has warned it will strike again with greater force if Israel or the US retaliates for the Iranian strike on Israel. The Iranian attack, which involved more than 300 drones and missiles, were carried out on Saturday night. In India, several leading airlines have cancelled flights to Iran and restricted their use of Israeli and Iranian airspace amid rapidly escalating tensions. This has spurred worries for Nepal, which is mostly dependent on remittance earnings that make for a substantial portion of its economy.Most rural households now depend on at least one member's earnings from employment abroad. Due to remittances, according to the latest living standard survey, the average annual spending on consumption rose by 66 percent in the past 12 years, reaching Rs126,172 in 2023 from Rs75,902 in 2011.According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, the remittance inflow stood at $9.33 billion in the last fiscal year, the record-high earnings that have taken the country’s foreign exchange reserve to a historic high. In the last fiscal year, 774,976 Nepali left the country for foreign jobs. According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank, Qatar is the top source market for Nepal, hosting 133,262 workers in the last fiscal year, followed by the UAE (116,160), Saudi Arabia (112,777), Kuwait (43,508), Oman (5,294), Bahrain (7,690) and Jordan (1,019).Israel hosted 1,084 Nepali workers in the last fiscal year. Experts say that a crisis in the Middle East, which employs nearly half of the migrant workers from Nepal, will potentially hit Nepal and suggest preparing strategies to absorb the emerging geopolitical shocks. “Tensions in the Middle East are not a good sign for a country like Nepal whose income largely depends on remittances,” said Ganesh Gurung, a migration expert. Besides, say economists, conflict in the key oil-producing countries pushes up inflation.The Asian Development Bank said in its recent report that any intensified geopolitical turmoil could disrupt supply chains, increasing global inflation and tightening financial conditions worldwide. This may lead to tightening of domestic monetary policy, which will undermine investment and consumption and may drag down growth for the ailing Nepali economy. “As we see, 1,200 to 1,500 Nepalis are leaving daily for Gulf countries for jobs. The conflict will stop many Nepalis from going to such countries. If these countries stopped hiring workers, the number of unemployed will rise,” said Gurung. “Greater unemployment at home could bring social disturbances.” Experts say the decline in remittances will reduce Nepal’s foreign currency reserves, which may cause severe stress on the economy as domestic production has stagnated.“The government needs to start preparing to absorb the potential shock,” said Gurung. Some countries are already working out strategies to avoid potential economic impact.On Sunday, the South Korean government announced heightened vigilance against potential domestic repercussions in light of the escalated tensions in the Middle East following Iran's attack on Israel, according to media reports.Also on Sunday, the Embassy of Nepal in Tel Aviv, Israel issued a notice requesting Nepalis to follow the local protocol directed by the Israeli Home Front Command. Nepal’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it is closely following the development in West Asia. “We are seriously concerned at the rising tensions and escalation of hostilities in the region. The government of Nepal firmly believes in a peaceful resolution of disputes and deplores the use of force. We call on all the parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint and use dialogue and diplomacy to restore peace,” the embassy statement said.Oil prices have also started going up.On Sunday, the Brent crude oil price reached $90.21 per barrel. Oil rose 1 percent on Friday on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.Last week, oil prices neared a six-month high on concerns that Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), might retaliate for a suspected Israeli warplane attack on Iran’s embassy in Damascus last Monday, according to the reports.The conflict’s impact on global oil markets is significant, as any risk of supply disruptions could lead to a price hike. Nepal is still bearing the cost of high oil prices which has pushed up inflation.Rising conflict has become a major concern for the disruption in the supply chain as Iran has threatened to shut down the Suez Canal. The disruption of shipping routes in the Red Sea will result in higher shipping costs, according to media reports.The World Bank said in its recent report that the cost of shipping from Asia to Europe has jumped to over US$3,000 for a 40-foot container, a threefold increase over the lowest rate in 2023 (about US$1,000).“The rise in tensions in the Middle East means trade disturbances globally,” said Chandramani Adhikari, an economist. “For Nepal, most of whose remittance comes from the Middle Eastern nations, it could spell disaster.”The government is happy with the improvements in external sectors which is mostly due to the boost in remittance. “But as soon as the labour markets get hit, there will be a direct impact on the country’s income,” said Adhikari. “People who are working in the conflict-hit countries might experience reduced savings due to the rise in the cost of living in the destination countries,” Adhikari said. “The rise in tensions will have an impact on the tourist arrivals as countries will issue travel advisories,” Adhikari said. “More polarisation among powerful economies, as they spend more on war, will also affect the foreign aid being provided to Nepal, besides foreign investment,” Adhikari said.The international conflict also has the potential to strengthen the dollar. The rise in oil prices and dollar rate will affect Nepal’s economy side-by-side as it impacts consumption and increases inflation, Adhikari said. “So, all these phenomena will hit Nepal’s economy.” \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane co-hosted \"Project Sambad,\" a forum for scrutinizing Nepali society and policy-making, with its inaugural event held in Kathmandu on March 14-15.\nNepali Congress' obstruction leads to adjournment of parliament until Thursday, preventing PM Dahal from presenting policies and a motion of thanks to the President.\nRegional political parties in Nepal, prominent after 2006, have experienced numerous splits and divisions, including the formation of new parties and resignation from government positions, leaving their influence diminished due to internal conflicts.\nA party split within the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) threatens to destabilize the Madhesh provincial government, with the CPN (Maoist Centre) discussing the formation of a new government while the JSP-Nepal claims to have the support of its provincial members.\nThe Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-N) led by Upendra Yadav will challenge the Election Commission's recognition of a new party formed by its spliter group, citing the absence of legal provisions for such a split.\nAlmost a year ago, CPN-UML, the then main opposition party, had demanded a high-level judicial commission to look into the involvement of influential leaders of the Nepali Congress and the CPN (Maoist Centre) in gold smuggling.Nepali Congress, then a main partner of the coalition government, had rejected such a demand.Now the UML, the senior partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, has rejected outright the demand of Congress, now the main opposition party, to form a parliamentary investigation committee against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling cooperative funds.The UML last year obstructed parliamentary proceedings for about a month as its demand was rejected by the ruling parties in the initial phase. At the time, the Congress fiercely criticised the UML for disrupting the House businesses, insisting on the panel’s formation.Now, the Congress, which continued its protests during the winter session of Parliament before it was prorogued on April 14, has warned of obstructing the new session of Parliament should the committee not be constituted.The new session of Parliament, which will pass the budget for the upcoming fiscal year, is scheduled to commence on Friday.However, UML leaders claim that their demand for the judicial investigation commission last year and the Congress’ demand for the parliamentary probe committee this time around are not the same.Many suspected the involvement of powerful people in gold smuggling, the UML leader said. “Therefore, we demanded a judicial probe commission independent of the state apparatus. Our demand was perfect; Congress leaders later admitted it and expressed their gratitude for our stance,” said UML leaders.Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, addressing the House last month, thanked UML leaders for their demand for a judicial committee to investigate the gold smuggling episode.“The Congress has shown its double standard regarding Home Minister Lamichhane,” UML Chief Whip Mahesh Bartaula told the Post. “Their leaders participated in parliamentary committee meetings where the home minister was present and addressed them. Why don’t they allow him to address the plenum of the same parliament?”In a meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee on Wednesday, Home Minister Lamichhane was present. He appeared before the committee also on March 28 and denied the allegations against him while responding to the questions raised by lawmakers. The committee is led by Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada.The views of the accused person need to be heard before forming any committee to probe him, argued Bartaula. However, the Congress leaders say they have already listened to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in Parliament defending Lamichhane and they are not satisfied with it. Thus the stance, they argue.“If their demand for a probe committee is honoured, the Congress will seek the home minister’s resignation to make the government unstable,” Bartaula said.Congress leaders want to make the parliamentary committee against the home minister a precondition for the smooth sailing of the new session of Parliament. Congress leaders argue that the judicial investigation commission earlier demanded by the UML and the parliamentary probe they want to constitute are different.Lamichhane has been linked with the cooperatives' embezzlement cases currently in Kaski and Rupandehi district courts. However, the state apparatus has undermined the cases and is trying to prove him innocent, Congress leaders argue.High-ranking officials including Prime Minister Dahal and Inspector General of Police Basanta Bahadur Kunwar have defended Lamichhane arguing that he is not guilty. Lately, the Attorney General’s office also has tried to prove him innocent, Congress leaders allege.“Despite the police reports which suggest Home Minister Lamichhane was involved in the cooperative scam, the whole state apparatus is trying to prove him innocent,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, the Congress spokesperson told the Post. “Therefore, our demand for a probe committee becomes all the more important.”From July 19 last year, the UML disrupted parliamentary meetings demanding a high-level probe into gold smuggling saying that the role of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police was not sufficient. But the ruling parties, including the Congress, at the time insisted that there was no need for another committee while the state agencies are competent enough to investigate and expose the wrong-doers, even if they are senior leaders.The UML, however, doubted the police investigation saying it wouldn’t be able to reach the masterminds of the gold haul claiming that police would have a slimmer chance to interrogate influential people of the ruling parties. After a serious discussion to lift the obstruction of Parliament, the government bowed to the pressure and formed a judicial committee on August 22 to probe gold smuggling following the Commission of Inquiry Act 1969. Dilli Raj Acharya, a former high court chief judge, led the commission.The commission submitted its report after studying the lapses in police investigation into the scam that involved the smuggling of 60kg gold by hiding the precious metal in motorcycle brake shoe imports. It also looked into another scam wherein 9kg of gold was smuggled by concealing it in electronic cigarettes in December 2022.The commission, in its report, implicated former Speaker and Maoist vice-chair Krishna Bahadur Mahara, among other powerful individuals, in the smuggling. Then police remanded Mahara and other accused persons in custody as suggested by the commission on March 18, 2024. However, he was released without bail on March 22 on the condition that he will be present to the CIB as and when needed.Citing the success of the judicial commission in the gold smuggling case, the Congress has now demanded a parliamentary probe against Lamichhane in the case of cooperative funds misappropriation.“Since no sitting ministers or high-profile people were accused in the gold smuggling case, we initially were reluctant to form a committee,” Mahat said.Amid accusations of cooperative operators defrauding depositors of millions of rupees, Lamichhane has repeatedly said he has no accounts in any cooperatives. Hence, there is no question of his involvement in embezzling the deposits, he argues. Lamichhane, then managing director of the Gorkha Media Network, and his business partner GB Rai, who has left the country, are accused of rerouting the cooperative funds to the now-closed Galaxy 4k Television.Speaker Ghimire summoned an all-party meeting on Tuesday, during which the ruling coalition recommended formation of a committee tasked with investigating the issues facing the cooperative sector as a whole, uncovering fraudulent activities there, and identifying the individuals responsible. Additionally, they suggested that the committee should take legal action against those engaged in the fraud.The Congress sticks to its demand for the probe committee.The two largest political parties, the Congress and the UML, have differing positions based on whether they are in the government or in the opposition. The UML, while in the opposition, had demanded the judicial committee in the gold smuggling case while the Congress, the coalition partner, had opposed it. Similar is the case in the cooperative scam where the Congress wants a parliamentary probe committee and the currently ruling party, UML, opposes it.Being in power or not should not determine whether to demand a probe committee or a judicial committee, political experts say. Both parliamentary or judicial committees are constituted in rare cases or that is the case in other countries, they said.“It is a clear example of our state mechanisms becoming dysfunctional,” Dambar Khatiwada, a political expert, told the Post. “Otherwise, political parties should have faith in the state apparatus rather than demand such committees.” \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n**Summarization:**\n\nKey events unfold, marked by battles, alliances, treaties, and political shifts, shaping the course of history.\nA man succumbs to burn injuries from a fire in Tapeshwar community forest while another remains hospitalized; a separate fire in Ananda forest forces evacuation of 65 patients from Anandaban Hospital.\nSeven Kathmandu wards have implemented waste segregation rules, with compost production, biogas generation, and non-degradable waste recycling being undertaken to address the city's garbage issue.\nEU-Nepal Business Forum 2024 to promote European investment in Nepal as part of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations, focusing on renewable energies and ICT sectors.\nThe Special Court summons five foreign individuals and five companies for a hearing in the 'wide-body scam' involving the purchase of Airbus A330s in 2017, alleging corruption and financial embezzlement causing a loss of Rs1.47 billion to the Nepalese government.\nThe private sector has urged the government to introduce a competitive tax rate to prevent smuggling, which has become rampant in the bordering areas, hurting the government’s revenue largely.Speaking at an economic summit titled ‘Fundamental Need of Economy: Joint Commitment from Political Leaders’ organised by Kantipur Media Group, in Kathmandu on Sunday, private sector representatives stressed the need for the government to introduce a progressive tax system citing the ongoing economic slowdown. They said such a tax system stimulates demand and spurs economic activity. Tax policies normally influence economic conditions.Kamlesh Agrawal, president of the Nepal Chamber of Commerce, said that Nepal and India share an open border, but the price difference in goods and services between the two immediate neighbours is 30-40 percent. “[Cross-border] Smuggling is thriving due to the price differences.”“To control the smuggling, the tax rates need to be made competitive,” said Agrawal. He was speaking on the theme ‘Issues of the private sector in budget, planning of policymakers’ during the first session of the summit.According to him, India has a 5-6 percent goods and service tax on essential goods while taxes on luxury goods are high. But in Nepal, the government has imposed a 13 percent VAT on essential goods.The private sector said that Nepal’s tax system is ‘upside-down’, meaning that people with lower incomes pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes than those with higher incomes. Agrawal questioned whether it was logical to impose the same VAT rates on all types of goods in a socialist economy system, where the factors of production like labour and natural resources are under the control of the government. He called for flipping Nepal’s tax system from a flat tax model. “The tax rate on essential goods should be reduced.” Agrawal said that all the political parties have committed to creating an environment for investment and economic development during the recently held Nepal Investment Summit, and now, the private sector is seeking to materialise the commitment.The private sector views three reasons for the current economic slowdown. Firstly, the government discouraged the private sector by imposing an import ban. Secondly, the slowdown in Nepal was due to the impact of the global economic slowdown. And thirdly, the policies and politics in Nepal are unstable which make investors think twice and thrice before making an investment plan.Nepal’s GDP has been projected to grow by 3.3 percent this fiscal year, mainly due to improvements in the tourism and hydropower sectors, according to the National Statistics Office. The national statistics show the construction and manufacturing sector is in negative growth while retail and wholesale trade are at near negative growth. These are the major pillars of the economy that engage major parts of the private sector.“So, in the upcoming budget, the government’s priority needs to be to end the economic slowdown and protect the private sector through policy reforms,” said Agrawal.Rajesh Agrawal, president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), said that for the last two years, the private sector has been facing trouble. “Trade and business are in crisis. Entrepreneurs are in a dire situation.”“Many small and medium entrepreneurs are leaving the country, especially to work abroad following the tight policies.” The external sector has recovered, but it has failed to revitalise the internal economy. “The improving external sector is mainly due to a robust increase in remittances, and the government is happy. We should think intensely about why remittances are increasing,” said the CNI president.“If we want to substitute imports and shift to production, then the government needs to bring stable policies. Without stable policies, it is difficult to invest as it requires a huge amount of money to open an industry,” he said.Chandra Prasad Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that investors are not confident to invest as they have doubts that the policies will change as soon as the government changes. Dhakal said, for instance, the previous budget made arrangements for the merger and acquisition of banks. “This year’s budget changed that policy. This is just an example. There have been many such instances in the past.”While the government may collect some taxes from mergers and acquisitions, it does not send a positive message to investors, Dhakal said. “The budget should address this issue.”Dhakal said that the situation of the economic slowdown has arrived due to the government’s mindset that the private sector, which only looks for profits, should be taxed top-down.Kalpana Khanal, a senior researcher at Policy Research Institute, a Kathmandu-based policy think tank, said that after Covid-19, the central bank had to opt for expansionary monetary policies and at the same time the fiscal policy too was expansionary as it was the demand of time. “This caused the sharp rise in the credit-to-GDP ratio, which means higher credit expansion.”The credit expansion, however, did not benefit the productive sector and instead went to the real estate sector. The profit was reinvested in the same sector. With this, banks and financial institutions have seen a rise in their non-performing assets as they fail to recover the loans.According to Khanal, in recent months deposits in banks are increasing by 14-15 percent, while credit is increasing by a meagre 4-5 percent. This shows a slowdown in investment.The tight monetary policies caused a fall in imports. “As the country’s revenue policy is directly linked to import, the government failed to collect revenue,” Khanal said. She said that other challenges in the economy include policies and political instability.Madhu Marasini, secretary at the Ministry of Finance, said that Nepal is a small open economy and that is why the impact of external factors makes the country’s economy vulnerable. “This means any global uncertainty will hit Nepal’s imports as the country is now import-dependent. Our production base not only has declined, but also become less competitive,” he said. “We need to become self-sufficient. We need our agriculture to grow.”He said that the country could not prosper by importing agri goods of Rs300 billion.Bureaucrats are traditional and conservative by nature so they do not dare to make fundamental huge shifts, Marasini said, adding that the system is guided by a political system. “The government is clear on not intervening much in tax, industrial and investment policies. We are here to facilitate businesses. If there is willingness from all political parties, the policies too will be favourable.”          \nFinance Minister Barshaman Pun on Sunday said that there was a need for critically analysing the state of the country.Speaking at the fourth edition of the Kantipur Economic Summit organised by the Kantipur Media Group, Minister Pun underscored the need to correct past mistakes and to review the shortcomings of the political parties and their leaders.“The overall situation of the country needs to be critically analysed. But that doesn’t mean that everything is bad and unsatisfactory,” Pun said. “Despite not being able to work to our full capacity, we have witnessed good progress in the hospitality and hydropower sectors among others, even during an economic slowdown.”The finance minister also said that the central and provincial governments had failed to coordinate, resulting in a failure to spend the money as allocated in the fiscal budget.While the state coffers fall short of Rs161 billion, the provincial and local bodies have been failing to spend Rs246 billion, Pun said. “We could not work in coordination.”He also admitted that the government had failed to invest in the construction industry, resulting in negative growth in the sector and slowed business. “This issue is understandable and not to shift blame to others. It is for the government to take care of.”Nepal Chamber of Commerce President Kamlesh Kumar Agrawal noted that the situation of the construction industry and the private sector was concerning.Agrawal claimed that the private sector, considered to be a key driver of the economy, had become sluggish due to restraints in the policies.The Nepali economy, which thrived even during the 2015 earthquake, India’s blockade, the Covid pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war, has now slowed down to policies that are unfavourable for investments, Agrawal said.The government policies, which are more stringent than required, have also negatively affected the morale of the industrialists, said Chandra Prasad Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industries.“The government took unnecessary precautions fearing a similar fate as that of Sri Lanka, which faced an economic crisis after the Covid pandemic. This not only impacted the private sector but resulted in a downfall in revenue collection,” Dhakal said. “The next budget should be formulated to increase the confidence of businesses and the general public.”According to Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries, the lack of investment and employment opportunities has also led to even business owners leaving the country.Adding to the mass exodus of Nepali youths, people operating small-scale businesses have also been compelled to leave the country due to unfavourable government policies, the CNI President said.In such a condition, the country has reached a state of having to rejoice in an increase in remittance, he added.“There is a necessity to develop a strategy to identify the goods and products deserving policy incentives,” Agrawal said. Likewise, Upendra Mahato, president of the Non-Resident Nepali Association, stated that the government had failed to realise the investment potential of the non-resident Nepalis.Besides sending remittances, the NRNA, which hosts approximately 6 million members, is also capable of investing in the country, Mahato stressed.The Nepal-NRN fund, jointly formed by the Nepali government and the NRNA, has a potential to bring in funds worth billions of dollars, but has not been able to do so, Mahato said.  “The government is eager to take funds, but going through the official procedures is tedious,” Mahato added. \nAs pre-monsoon rains pick up pace, concerns mount about an imminent outbreak of the dengue disease. All that is required for the disease to flare up are stagnant water and hot temperatures, both already present in various parts of the country.“Dengue vectors are already there in many places across the country,” said Professor Murari Das, an entomologist at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “With the right conditions like water and warmth required for vector breeding available now, we can expect a spike in dengue cases in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that 57 districts, including three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—have already reported cases of dengue infection.“On average, around 50 people across the country are becoming infected with the dengue virus every week,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “The number could rise in the coming days, as pre-monsoon rainfall activities have recently increased.”Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease throughout the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Around 1,000 people have already been infected with the deadly disease since the start of 2024, according to officials.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of people infected with the deadly virus do not show any symptoms. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus throughout the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Experts say that this is the right time to prepare and prevent possible outbreaks in the coming days.They say that it will be too late if they wait for a massive outbreak. Authorities concerned should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance and take other measures to cut the risk, according to them. Health Ministry officials said that they have alerted all agencies concerned about the risk of a dengue outbreak.“We have alerted all relevant agencies about the risk of a dengue outbreak in the coming days,’ said Dahal. Authorities and agencies at some local units have started activities to make people aware of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, including launching an awareness drive.”Dengue has become endemic in Nepal, as cases of infection are reported throughout the year. Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities are yet to take it seriously. They believe that this lackadaisical approach is responsible for the spread of the virus. What authorities concerned do most of the time is count the number of infections and deaths, according to them.They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population plans to screen pregnant women for mental health problems, which have been emerging as a leading cause of maternal deaths.Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and prompt treatment will help cut down on maternal deaths that have been rising alarmingly of late.“We plan to start screening from Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital,” said Dr Gauri Shrestha, chief of the Safe Motherhood Programme at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “As part of the pilot, all pregnant women seeking service will be screened from the first and postnatal trimesters.”A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with the majority occurring during pregnancy.The report shows that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications.Nepal had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The report showed 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. The study was carried out in 2021.Every year, hundreds of women in the country succumb to preventable deaths from excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), which have been identified as chief causes of maternal deaths in Nepal.However, the 2021 study also shows that a significant number of maternal deaths are also caused by non-obstetric complications such as intentional self-harm.Of the 611 maternal deaths on which the study was based, 67 percent occurred during and after childbirth, according to the report.The census report shows 33 percent of the total maternal deaths occurred during pregnancy, six percent died during childbirth and 61 percent during the postpartum stage.Of the total maternal deaths, nearly a half (47 percent) occurred in Lumbini and Madhesh provinces. The report shows that 10 percent of the victims were 15 to 19 years old. Fifty-seven percent of the deaths happened in health facilities and 26 percent at homes. Of the total maternal deaths, 412 women (53 per cent) went to four antenatal care visits, and of the 173 women who died between seven to 42 days, 45 percent had received postnatal care.As part of its efforts to reduce maternal deaths, the Health Ministry has made it mandatory for women to make eight antenatal care visits and three postnatal care visits.Of the total maternal deaths, six percent (37 women) had undergone abortion or suffered a miscarriage. The report shows that 62 percent of the women took maternity services at state-run health facilities whereas 38 percent gave birth at private health centres.The report shows family members of 83 percent of women who died during or after childbirth tried to get hospital care. Forty-eight percent of those who did use hospital services did not deem it necessary to seek institutional care, according to the report.Delay in finding appropriate health facilities (57 percent), delay in reaching appropriate health facilities (33 percent) and delay in getting appropriate health services (40 percent) are three major causes of maternal deaths, the study shows. Of the total maternal deaths, 17 percent were attributed to all three aforementioned causes and 74 percent to at least one of three causes.The report suggested improving the quality of services and the referral system and making ambulances available for emergency calls as possible ways for identifying the risks on time. The report also suggested carrying out maternal death surveillance regularly to reduce preventable deaths.The Ministry of Health and Population has launched various programmes including free institutional delivery service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. The ministry has also distributed misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. “As the annual health budget does not help us carry out screening of mental health programmes in many places, we are starting the programme as a pilot from the Maternity Hospital,” said Shrestha. “This programme will be expanded in the coming years to other districts, as it is impossible to prevent suicide of pregnant women without treatment of mental health problems.”Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nAt least 50 health workers including medical officers, health assistants and paramedics serving in health facilities of Kathmandu district have been trained to screen patients suffering from non-communicable diseases.The Kathmandu Health Office provided the health workers with a four-day training. The trained health workers will screen major non-communicable diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health problems, among others, in patients seeking healthcare at local health facilities of the district, according to officials at the Health Office Kathmandu.“Patients seeking healthcare services at the local units of Kathmandu will be screened for non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “Health workers will prescribe medicines for non-communicable diseases, counsel patients and refer them to a tertiary care centre if the problems are complicated.”Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.The study showed that the leading risk factor of death in 2019 was smoking, whose attributable death was 17.7 percent, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution 9.3 percent, diabetes 8 percent, high cholesterol, and kidney dysfunction, among others.The Ministry of Health and Population has included medicines for non-communicable diseases in the list of 98 free essential medicines, which it provides free of cost from state-run health facilities.The free medicines on the list include medicines for some non-communicable diseases—mental health, cardiovascular, respiratory illness and diabetes, among others.Officials say that even if the burden of non-communicable diseases surpassed communicable diseases years ago and medicines for some ailments are provided free of cost, many people do not know their disease conditions due to lack of screening at health facilities.The Health Ministry in the past had decided to provide free screening for certain non-communicable diseases to people above 40 years old. However, such services have not started in many health facilities.“Trained health workers will screen the patients visiting health facilities they serve at,” said Sapkota. “We hope that patients suffering from non-communicable diseases will be diagnosed on time, which will ultimately help in lessening the burden of non-communicable diseases.”Doctors say most people do not undergo testing unless it is an emergency and also do not know if they are suffering from a serious ailment. They say that a lot of lives will be saved if testing of non-communicable diseases is made free.Public health experts say the increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases is a global phenomenon but developing countries like Nepal have been facing a double burden. \nIn nine months of the current fiscal year, the Department of Drug Administration has tested 348 samples of medicines collected by its drug inspectors from across the country.Of nearly 20,000 medicines, both registered and unregistered ones in the market, drug inspectors had collected for testing hundreds of samples of drugs suspected to be substandard.However, the department, which is also the national regulatory body of the drug market, carried out tests on less than two percent of the total registered drugs in the country.“Some samples of medicines collected by our drug inspectors some 13 months ago are yet to be tested,” said Narayan Dhakal, director general of the department. “Some samples suspected to be substandard and collected for a quality test might already have expired.”Ensuring the quality of medicines being prescribed to patients is the responsibility of the department. Its drug inspectors collect samples of medicines on a random basis from the market and send them for lab tests at the National Medicines Laboratory under the department.Officials at the DDA said several samples of medicines on which quality testing was carried out in the current fiscal year were found substandard and recalled from the market.Dhakal concedes that the samples tested by the department are not sufficient to ensure the quality of the medicines.“We have tested too few samples,” an official at the department said. “And the fact is some medicines on which tests were done were found to be substandard, which means other drugs in the market also could be problematic. Patients might have been taking substandard medicines.”Experts say the use of substandard medicines could adversely affect patients’ health. Dhakal said that ensuring the quality of the medicines is also the responsibility of the drug manufacturing companies and it is not possible to test each and every medicine.“I must concede that we have not tested nearly enough medicines to ensure quality,” said Dhakal. “Several factors including understaffing are responsible for this.”Around 40 staffers have been serving in the National Medicines Laboratory under the department.Ensuring the quality of medicines in Nepal has always been an issue, as the national drug regulator grapples with a staff crunch, and its laboratory doesn't have the capacity to carry out timely tests.Drug inspectors deployed from the DDA take random samples of drugs and send them for testing to the government’s laboratory. If drugs are found problematic or substandard, the department directs the manufacturing companies to recall those drugs from the market. However, the department does not have an effective mechanism to ensure the recall either.In most cases, delays in testing at the laboratory mean that results come in only after all the substandard drugs in the market have been sold.While thousands of medicines manufactured by national as well as international pharma companies are being sold from pharmacies across the country, DDA inspectors collect only around 1,000 samples in a year. The inspection work is especially hard as the DDA has just around two dozen drug inspectors tasked with monitoring over 21,000 registered pharmacies and thousands of unregistered ones.Moreover, it takes several months to examine some medicines as the DDA’s laboratory is understaffed with several posts for technicians remaining vacant. The department allows the drug manufacturing companies to supply medicines to the market directly from the factory. \nA few weeks ago, an eight-month-old baby girl from Arubari in the Capital was rushed to the Chabahil-based Om Hospital and Research Center, as the child was experiencing shortness of breath.The child’s parents told the doctor that the baby didn't have a fever but would make a wheezing sound while exhaling.“The baby was suffering from childhood asthma,” said Dr Rita Hamal, a consultant paediatrician at the hospital. “We admitted her and provided oxygen therapy. It took three days for her condition to improve.”As the Capital’s air quality continues to worsen, often reaching hazardous levels, this is a common refrain among hundreds of children brought to hospitals for treatment of childhood asthma.The ongoing forest fires, vehicular and industrial emissions, and the burning of agriculture residue throughout the country have made the air toxic, exacerbating asthma problems in small children.A recent report by Save the Children shows critical linkages between air pollution and multi-faceted hazards for children.The report titled “Breathless Future: Unveiling the Impacts of Air Pollution on Children and Women in Kathmandu and Saptari” shows the systemic impact of air pollution on various aspects of children's lives. The report also explored the effects of air pollution on women and underrepresented groups.“Deteriorating air quality, both outdoors and indoors, has exposed children and women to a multitude of health hazards— asthma, other lung conditions, coughing, skin disease, nausea, and headache,” reads the report. “ Alarmingly, these conditions have led to increased cases of pregnancy loss, child organ underdevelopment, and a general decline in life expectancy.”The study carried out in Kathmandu and Saptari, two of the most polluted districts in the country, highlights a significant knowledge gap related to air pollution, including its effects in indoor settings and associated health risks, particularly for women and children who spend extensive periods inside their homes. Experts say the deterioration of air quality seriously affects public health. Poor air quality causes both short- and long-term effects on public health. Bad air quality can cause pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke and heart problems, among others, in the short term, ulcers and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease and heart problems in the long run.People living in areas with high levels of air pollution are most likely to suffer from asthma, and small children are not immune to these problems, according to doctors. “Earlier more children would suffer from pneumonia,” said Dr Ganesh Rai, former director at the Kanti Children’s Hospital, Kathmandu. “These days, cases of childhood asthma have surpassed pneumonia.”Child health experts say that in most cases childhood asthma can be cured by an appropriate and timely treatment but uncontrolled asthma can lead to lung damage. In many cases, parents mistake asthma for pneumonia. Some parents are unaware of the signs, and the children could suffer from asthma, although asthma is commonly associated with the elderly.“Polluted air has exacerbated childhood asthma in our country, this fact should be understood by all,” said Rai. “Oftentimes, when children do not show fever or other symptoms, parents unknowingly overlook asthma and do not take the children to hospital for too long. It is crucial to seek medical help if a child has shortness of breath, trouble sleeping, or wheezing while breathing out.”Apart from polluted air, several other triggering factors including allergies, family history of asthma, and frequent respiratory illnesses are also responsible for childhood asthma, according to doctors. Studies show that polluted air has been shortening the lives of Nepali people. Polluted air has been cutting short the lives of Nepali people by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively.The reduction in life expectancy depends on where one lives—7.5 years in Mahottari, 7.4 years in Rautahat and Dhanusha, and 7.2 years in Sarlahi and Bara districts, the AQLI report said. Likewise, the pollution has been shaving 6.7 years off the lives of people residing in Siraha, and 6.2 years in Saptari and Rupandehi districts. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nCoach Vincenzo Alberto Annese has announced a 28-member preliminary squad for Nepal’s 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup second round qualifier match against the United Arab Emirates.Rohit Chand has returned to the squad after missing out both legs against Bahrain in March.Defenders Abhishek Limbu, Bishal Basnet, Saubhagya Rai and Ajay Chaudhary, midfielder Rohan Karki and forward Samir Tamang, who were called up for the first time for Bahrain games, have retained their place in the preliminary squad.Nepal, pitted in Group H alongside the UAE, Bahrain and Yemen, have already crashed out of the second round without playing their remaining two matches after a winless run of four successive matches left them at the bottom of the group and without a point.Nepal were scheduled to host the UAE for their second leg at the Dasharath Stadium—Nepal’s only international standard football stadium—on June 6 but will once again play their home fixture at a neutral venue, according to All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) sources. “Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has directed ANFA to find a neutral venue for the UAE fixture citing lack of standard of Dasharath Stadium,” an ANFA source said.AFC representatives had raised questions about the stadium’s pitch, flood light and security following an inspection earlier this month. AFC and ANFA, however, have yet to make their decision public.Nepal were also forced to play their home match against Bahrain at the Bahrain National Stadium in Riffa after AFC deemed Dasharath Stadium unsatisfactory to host the World Cup qualifier game.Nepal lost the double fixture against Bahrain 5-0 and 3-0, which had effectively ended Nepal’s hopes to progress to the third round and book an automatic spot in the Asian Cup.Earlier, Nepal had lost their home match against Yemen 2-0 in Kathmandu and away match to the UAE 4-0 at the Al-Maktoum Stadium in Dubai.Nepal will wrap up their qualifier campaign with a match against Yemen on June 11.Nepal still have hopes to qualify for their maiden Asian Cup. They will play in the Asian Cup Qualification (playoffs) in March next year.Nepal squadGoalkeepers: Abhishek Baral, Bishal Sunar, Kiran Chemjong, Santosh MahatDefenders: Abhishek Limbu, Ananta Tamang, Bimal Pandey, Bishal Basnet, Chhiring Lama, Rohit Chand, Sanish Shrestha, Saubhagya Rai, Ajay Chaudhary, Yogesh GurungMidfielders: Bharat Khawas, Laken Limbu, Mani Kumar Lama, Manish Dangi, Basant Jimba, Phatteman Ghale, Rohan Karki, Sumit ShresthaForwards: Anjan Bista, Dinesh Henjan, Gillespye Jung Karki, Hisub Thapaliya, Samir Tamang, Sanjeeb Bista \nDefending champions Armed Police Force Club maintained its winning streak in the Lalitpur Mayor Women’s T20 Championship defeating Bagmati Province by eight wickets at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Monday.The departmental team, APF, are the most successful side of the T20 tournament having won all three previous editions and stayed on track to reach their fourth final—and potentially a record-extending fourth trophy—thanks to a four-wicket haul from Karuna Bhandari and a brilliant batting display from opener Mamta Chaudhary.APF opted to field first and restricted Bagmati to 73-6 in 20 overs, with Chaudhary playing the destroyer-in-chief as she dismissed opener Kanchan Shrestha (4), Yashoda Bist (3) and Sony Pakhrin (0) to rip apart the top and middle order. Bagmati’s number one batter Helisha Gurung battled alone scoring 31 off 50 balls but eventually fell in the 15th over to APF skipper Sita Rana Magar, who also dismissed Bagmati captain Ashmina Karmacharya (3).Bhandari then got her fourth wicket removing Bipasha Shahi in the 16th over.Khushi Dangol played 14 not out facing 22 deliveries to drag Bagmati past 70 total.In reply, APF lost Rana Magar for 11 in the 2.5 overs and national team captain Indu Barma for 17 in the 6th over but opener Mamta Chaudhary played 35 not out off 32 balls to guide APF to 74-2 in 11 overs.Chaudhary also had little help from Rajmati Airee who made 10 runs off 12 balls.A second straight victory gave APF four points and summit position in the five-team standings. Sudurpaschim also have four points after defeating Koshi Province by 19 runs in the afternoon. They sit in the second position due to net run rate.Samjhana Khadka shone the brightest on the day as her half-century helped Sudurpaschim to a moderate 112-8 total.Khadka scored 54 runs in her 51-ball knock that featured four boundaries.Sudurpaschim lost their opener Sabitri Dhami for a duck in the fourth delivery of the first over and captain Bindu Rawal for 14 in the fifth.But Khadka laid a strong foundation for victory with the first fifty in this edition of the tournament despite a disastrous display from other batters, with Rubi Poddar (2), Kabita Joshi (5), Rewati Dhami (0), Shova Rokaya (0) all departing miserably.Khadka finally found much needed support from Ritu Kanoujiya and the duo put on a 57-run stand for the seventh wicket to guide Sudurpaschim past 100 total. Tailender Ritu Kanoujiya made 23 runs facing 35 deliveries.Hiranmayee Roy, Sabnam Rai and Sangita Rai took two wickets each for Koshi, while Alisha Khadiya picked one.In reply, Kajal Shrestha and Apsari Begam added 52 runs for the second wicket to give Koshi a solid start.However, after Laxmi Saud dispatched Begam for 23 (34) in the 13th over and Rawal got rid of Shrestha for 33 (40) in the 15th over, Koshi stumbled. None other batters could score in double digits as Koshi could only manage 93-7 and succumbed to a second straight loss.Bagmati, who also suffered a second successive loss, lie at the bottom and below fourth-placed Koshi.Lalitpur Mayor’s XI occupy the third position with two points. \nLalitpur Mayor's XI won their opening match of the Lalitpur Mayor Women's T20 Championship with a seven-wicket victory over Bagmati Province, thanks to Kritika Marasini's hat-trick.\nGovernment awards cash prizes totaling Rs29.71 million to athletes and teams, including cricketers qualifying for the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup and a historic silver medalist in karate.\nNepal defeated West Indies A by six wickets in the fifth T20, with Aasif Sheikh, Anil Sah, and Kushal Malla starring with the bat and Sagar Dhakal and Sompal Kami impressive with the ball.\nPM Modi defended his unity amid accusations of division as he filed his re-election nomination while shifting campaign focus towards accusing Congress of favoring Muslims.\nDespite international warnings, Israeli tanks penetrated residential districts of Rafah, intensifying fighting in the southern border city amid heightened Palestinian casualties and a setback in ceasefire efforts.\nPatients taking Novo Nordisk’s (NOVOb.CO), popular Wegovy obesity treatment maintained an average of 10% weight loss after four years on the treatment, the company said on Tuesday.Novo presented the new long-term data at the European Congress on Obesity in Venice, Italy, gleaned from a large study for which much of the results had been published last year.“This is the longest study we’ve conducted so far of semaglutide for weight loss,” Martin Holst Lange, Novo’s head of development, said in an interview, referring to the active ingredient in Wegovy and the company’s diabetes drug Ozempic.“We see that once the majority of the weight loss is accrued, you don’t go back and start to increase in weight if you stay on the drug,” he added.The data could bolster the company’s case as it tries to convince insurers and governments to reimburse Wegovy and deflect notions that it is a lifestyle drug.Wegovy was the first to market from a newer generation of medicines known as GLP-1 agonists, originally developed for diabetes, that provide a new way to address record obesity rates. Eli Lilly (LLY.N), launched its rival drug Zepbound in the United States in December. Neither company has been able to produce enough to meet unprecedented demand.Dr. Simon Cork, Senior Lecturer in Physiology from Anglia Ruskin University, said Britain’s public health service’s decision to limit coverage of the medicine to two years was \"because of questionable long-term effectiveness”.The new data showing benefits continuing to four years may go some way to negating that argument, he said.The 17,604-patient trial tested Wegovy not for weight loss but for its heart protective benefits for overweight and obese patients who had preexisting heart disease but not diabetes. Participants were not required to track diet and exercise because it was not an obesity study.Patients in the trial called Select lost an average of nearly 10% of their total body weight after 65 weeks on Wegovy. That percentage weight-loss was roughly sustained year-on-year until the end of about four years, where weight loss stood at 10.2%, the company said.Wegovy and Zepbound are being tested to assess their benefits in a variety of other medical uses such as lowering heart attack risk and for sleep apnea and kidney disease.The weight loss in the heart trial was less than the average of 15% weight loss in earlier Wegovy obesity studies before the drug was launched in the United States in June 2021. \nAt least 14 people have died and dozens were injured after a huge billboard fell on them during a thunderstorm in India’s financial capital Mumbai, according to local authorities.The billboard collapsed on some houses and a petrol station next to a busy road in the eastern suburb of Ghatkopar following gusty winds and rain late on Monday.Scores were trapped following the incident with rescue operations continuing till early on Tuesday. The thunderstorm brought traffic to a standstill in parts of the city and disrupted operations at its airport, one of the country’s busiest.Mumbai’s municipal corporation said at least 74 people were taken to hospital with injuries following the accident and 31 have been discharged. \nFlash floods and mud slides in Indonesia’s West Sumatra province killed at least 43 people over the weekend while a search for 15 missing people continued, authorities said on Monday.Torrential rain on Saturday evening triggered flash floods, landslides, and cold lava flow - a mud-like mixture of volcanic ash, rock debris and water - in three districts in West Sumatra province, Abdul Malik, chief of the provincial rescue team, told Reuters.The cold lava flow, known in Indonesia as a lahar, came from Mount Marapi, one of Sumatra’s most active volcanoes.In December, more than 20 people were killed after Marapi erupted. A series of eruptions has followed since.“The heavy rain swept materials such as ash and large rocks from the Marapi volcano,” said Abdul Malik, who later added in a statement that 43 people had died and 15 remained missing.“Cold lava flow and flash floods have always been threats to us recently. But the problem is, it always happens late at night until dawn,” he said.Abdul said around 400 personnel, including rescuers, police, and military, were deployed to search for the missing people on Monday, helped by at least eight excavators and drones.The national disaster and management agency BNPB said in a statement almost 200 houses were damaged and 72 hectares (178 acres) of lands, including rice fields, were affected. At least 159 people from Agam district were evacuated to nearby schools.Footage shared by BNPB showed roads and rice fields covered by mud. Video also showed the wreckage of damaged homes and buildings, while the floods brought logs and large rocks into settlements.Eko Widodo, a 43-year-old survivor, said: “The flooding was sudden and the river became blocked which resulted in the flow of water everywhere and it was out of control.” \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \n“It [Nepal] must move away from merely paying lip service to the ideals of achieving equality for all but take a concrete human rights-centric approach to relegating descent-based discrimination to the dustbins of history.” These are the powerful words of Fernanda Doz Costa, Amnesty International’s director of the gender and racial discrimination programme, at the launch of Amnesty International Nepal’s report on Dalits on May 10, 2024. Researched in 2023, the report is entitled ‘“No-one Cares”: Descent-Based Discrimination Against Dalits’.In this column, I analyse the report, focusing on its strengths and limitations while appreciating its potential value for the Dalit freedom struggle.A useful exercise All the talk about human rights and justice appears hollow in today’s world as we watch the horrifying images of the Israeli forces slaughtering tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians—many of them women and children—with total impunity. Even the United Nations has failed to stop this genocide.One wonders, then, what difference the voice of any human rights organisation or movement would make in any way, anywhere at all. While the concerns of international human rights organisations like Amnesty International may practically mean nothing for rich and powerful countries with powerful blind supporters like Israel, they could still prove useful in powerless and donor-dependent countries like ours. Here, Western governments and agencies have a degree of leverage, which could be utilised to liberate the suppressed masses. I, therefore, commend the organisation for carrying out this research on the largely forgotten caste discrimination issue. If anything, this report helps amplify voices against the persistent suffering of the Dalits and the total apathy of the state and non-state actors, both at the national and international levels. The study’s findings are largely consistent with the everyday experiences of most Dalits across the country and, to some extent, in the diaspora communities too. Additionally, the Amnesty report gives a set of specific and notable recommendations to the federal parliament, the prime minister’s office, the home ministry, as well as to the National Human Rights Commission, the Dalit Commission and UN agencies to take Dalit issues seriously and take appropriate measures to tackle them. Indeed, silence and inaction have persisted for too long while Dalits continue to be killed, injured, raped, humiliated and excluded; caste bigotry and hate are on the rise. And, as the report rightly suggests, Dalit women and girls have suffered the most. The report’s findings and recommendations can help Dalit activists raise their voices and garner wider support and solidarity for their cause. It could become a catalyst for generating greater interest in the issue and reviving and revitalising the Dalit movement, which has become dormant over the years. Forgotten religion and culture The Amnesty report repeatedly asks Nepali authorities not to limit Dalit problems to criminalisation and to find a more holistic solution. Unfortunately, the report itself lacks a nuanced or holistic analysis. Too much emphasis on impunity and an unresponsive legal and judicial system overshadows the bigger picture. The analysis is shallow, as religion and culture, the tectonic plates that move the whole thing, have been ignored. The report does occasionally mention the “Hindu caste system” but refrains from delving into it. This is a wrong approach because the fundamental underlying cause of the persistence and prevalence of caste discrimination is the Hindu religion and culture. I don’t state this as a scholar or an activist; ask any non-political and ordinary Dalit person, and the facts will become clear. In the everyday experience of the Dalits, including many Dalit leaders and activists themselves, caste-based humiliation and exclusion are based on their ritually polluted status. Lack of access to power, poverty, illiteracy and other factors are secondary. As we sometimes see in news reports, even mayors and ward or municipal chairs in many parts of the country face caste-based exclusion. I’m sure many Dalit lawmakers themselves would struggle to rent property in Kathmandu because the landlords fear offending their ancestral spirits and other deities through contact with the ritually polluted! Herein lies the root of the problem: Nepalis are highly religious and spiritual people who live in constant fear and awe of their gods, their lineage deities, and the spirit of their dead ancestors. There is a strong belief that any transgression of the traditional ritual hierarchy based on caste would offend the supernatural powers, thereby causing death and destruction in the family and community. Caste is so sacred that many Nepalis would rather go to jail or even die than flout certain caste rules and “invite” the terrible wrath of their gods or deceased relatives. For these fundamentalists, state laws and law enforcement hardly mean anything.Why has there been a surge in attacks against the Dalits in recent years? Why don’t many police officers, administrators and judges take the caste discrimination issue seriously? Why do prime ministers and ministers and legislators turn a deaf ear to Dalit voices for change? Why have Dalit activists themselves not been very effective in defending their rights? All these questions can be answered with just two words: Religion and culture. There is a contradiction between state laws and religious/cultural laws. Today’s policemen and judges probably don’t need to be preached about universal human rights, but they also cannot deny their long-standing cultural and spiritual beliefs and practices of keeping their castes sacred. If religio-cultural traditions have greatly ‘caste-ified’ our social psychology, how can those in legal and judicial power positions be immune from it? This is the crux of the problem that needs unpacking by all sides.Problem with methodology?I understand the sensitivities surrounding religion and culture in any country or society. I don’t know why the Amnesty report remained silent on these complex yet vital issues. However, I suspect part of the problem lies in the research methodology itself. If you want new insights into any topic, you must involve and work with the younger generation. During the report’s launch, I saw the same old faces of Dalit activists and lawyers. I don’t mean to undermine their ongoing and historical contribution, but the new and younger generation also deserves a voice. The report was prepared with support from and consultation with Dalit non-governmental organisations that have long been commanded by the same old people. Moreover, they are usually connected to a political party, and upper-caste leaders invariably control every party. No wonder, mainstream Dalit discourse is still shy about putting religion and culture in the spotlight. The report itself makes it amply clear that the Dalit movement thus far has been toothless and that there is a need for new ways of tackling the problem. However, to show a new direction for freedom fighters and organise a paradigm shift, international players must move beyond their usual consultation with the same old activists and groups and find new kids on the block. Talking directly with the ordinary Dalits instead of through mediation with established groups would make ground realities apparent.  \nThe Government of Nepal is hosting an international dialogue titled “Mountains, People, and Climate Change” on May 22-23, 2024, in Kathmandu. The event aims to strengthen coordination and prioritise mountain-centric priorities and actions within the broader context of climate change. By convening mountain-based scientists, policymakers and practitioners, this dialogue will drive the ongoing efforts to position mountains as a pivotal element of the global agenda and as a key negotiation block within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Mountains are critical to both nature and humanity, offering essential ecological services. They are home to 15 percent of the global population and nearly half of the world's biodiversity hotspots. More than a third of the global population depends on freshwater sourced from mountains, with the Himalayan region alone supplying water to approximately 240 million people living in mountainous areas and over 1.6 billion people downstream. These regions deliver unique ecosystem services, including provisioning (food, water, medicines, energy), regulating (air quality, carbon storage, water filtration, pollution and disease control), supporting (habitat for wildlife, nutrient cycling) and cultural (tourism, recreation, education, spiritual well-being and indigenous knowledge).Despite their global significance, mountains face unprecedented environmental threats, primarily from climate change, air pollution, heat, drought, erratic rainfall and snowfall patterns. The rate of warming in mountain areas is disproportionately higher than in the plains. Projections indicate that the average temperature in the mountains could rise by over 1.8 degrees Celsius by 2050, while global efforts aim to cap warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Additionally, glacial lake outburst floods pose perennial threats, with current emission pathways suggesting that 80 percent of the glacier’s volume could disappear by 2100. Over two-thirds of indigenous mountain species are at risk of extinction, and mountain economies, which heavily rely on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, tourism and hydropower, are particularly vulnerable.The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report confirms that climate change and climate-induced disasters negatively impact mountain livelihoods, leading to resource degradation, declining production and the displacement of people, along with their cultural heritage and practices. Losses and damages, which are inevitable and unequally distributed, disproportionately affect developing countries and vulnerable groups such as low socio-economic classes, migrant groups, the elderly, women and children.Given their vulnerability, it is urgent and imperative to prioritise the mountain agenda in global climate change discussions to ensure the provision of resources, capacity and technology. Although global advocacy for mountains has gained momentum through various initiatives, like the “Mountain Partnership,” this agenda has yet to be fully acknowledged and integrated into global environmental negotiations, including UNFCCC decisions. Mountains and the cryosphere were discussed at COP26, but these discussions could not get momentum to influence decision-making significantly.Nepal has prioritised mountain and climate change issues since preparing its National Adaptation Programme of Actions (NAPA) in 2010. Building on previous initiatives, the Government of Nepal began systematically advocating for the mountain agenda in national and global forums last year. This advocacy gained momentum following UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's visit to Nepal, witnessing the disastrous impacts of climate change on the mountains and calling for immediate action. The agenda has been further pronounced by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in COP28, most notably in the high-level roundtable on “Call of the Mountains: Who Saves us from the Climate Crisis?”, which demanded a dialogue on mountains and climate change.This concerted effort culminated at COP28—where the importance of mountain ecosystems was acknowledged—led to the decision to hold an expert dialogue on mountains and climate change during the 60th sessions of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) scheduled for June 2024. The expert dialogue will provide space for scientists, policymakers and frontline communities to come together and share knowledge, experience and insights on strengthening the resilience of mountain ecosystems.Considering the opportunities to accelerate the mountain agenda in the forthcoming 60th sessions of the UNFCCC in June 2024, the Government of Nepal is hosting an international expert dialogue on mountains, people and climate change. Through this dialogue, Nepal aims to strengthen solidarity and prioritise mountain-based actions for climate justice, develop concrete roadmaps and foster collaboration among mountainous countries to address their shared vulnerabilities to climate change. This includes exploring and exchanging knowledge, research, and innovative solutions to promote partnerships concerning technology transfer, capacity development, and climate finance. This initiative aligns with broader goals of justice for nature and the preservation of human civilisation. By addressing these critical issues in a humane and equitable manner, the dialogue seeks to ensure that mountain communities do not bear an undue burden of global environmental changes and can continue to contribute to the richness of our global ecological and cultural landscapes.Ultimately, the dialogue aims to create a shared platform that not only raises awareness but also promotes collaboration across nations to foster a common understanding and unified position on the pressing issues facing mountainous regions.Expectations from the mountainous countries for the forthcoming international negotiations are resolutely centred on forging robust partnerships for climate justice. We urge that keeping the global temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius is vital for mountains, ecosystems and people. Delivering adequate, predictable and accessible funds and technology is urgent to support science-based locally-led climate actions. The full operationalisation of loss and damage funds in a transparent and equitable way is necessary to compensate for economic and non-economic losses in the mountains. Likewise, we want to see the global and domestic policies and plans put the most vulnerable women, youth, children, disabled people, indigenous people and local communities in the mountains at the priority of climate action. The global community should transform dialogue into decisive action, ensuring that concerted efforts provide sustainable and equitable benefits to all, preserving the delicate balance of mountain environments for future generations. \nRice prices are surging in Nepal. Last July, India, the world’s largest rice exporter, banned the export of widely consumed non-Basmati white rice. There are similar restrictions—either a complete ban or allocation of export quotas through high duties on exports—on the export of wheat, sugar and onion. Ahead of the national elections being held over almost seven weeks from April 19, India was probably aiming at bringing down domestic prices by increasing supplies. Earlier this month, the southern neighbour lifted the ban on onion export—in effect since last December—but with a minimum export price of $550 per tonne, which traders fear could exert upward pressure on prices in Nepal. As a nation increasingly reliant on Indian imports to fill domestic gaps in, let us say, onion supply, Nepal may just be an unintended victim, but this also lays bare the unbalanced nature of its trade balance. India is Nepal’s largest trade partner. In the last fiscal year through mid-July 2023, Nepal ran a trade deficit of Rs1,455 billion, of which Rs921 billion—or over 63 percent of the total—was attributed to India. The next largest deficit, Rs221 billion, or just over 15 percent, was with China. India also made up just over 64 percent of Nepal’s merchandise trade at Rs1,769 billion, with China a distant second at under 13 percent. Simply put, the Nepal-India trade relationship is dangerously lopsided.The cultural, religious, societal and other ties between India and Nepal go back to history. Topographically, the southern border is plain and, therefore, porous. In contrast, Nepal’s border to the north with China’s Tibet is harsh, mountainous and has inadequate road connections. For a landlocked nation, over time, Nepal’s trade reliance on India became the path of least resistance. This should hardly come as a surprise. What is surprising is the prevailing deteriorating trend. Until not too long ago, Nepal used to be self-sufficient in staples like rice. However, it is no longer so. Importantly, nearly all its petroleum needs are fulfilled by India. This kind of dependence can give any nation the temptation to take undue advantage. Protectionism: Pros and consLast month, 17 truckloads of India-bound Nepali tea were stopped by Indian customs for five days on the eastern border, citing a Commerce Ministry circular to mandatorily conduct lab tests on all tea imports from Nepal; previously, tests were done on five to 20 percent of Nepali tea. Ilam’s tea is a competitor to Darjeeling’s. Nepali traders also complain of India’s anti-dumping duties—which are levied on imported goods believed to be priced below fair market value—as one of the primary reasons for a decline over the years in Nepali readymade jute products. Repeated requests, including by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his India visit last year, to lift the duties have fallen on deaf ears. Anti-dumping duties are protectionist by nature. The importing countries believe they are facing unfair competition from imports, so they are trying to protect their own jobs and industries. The World Trade Organization does allow anti-dumping measures if it is determined that dumping is occurring. But these duties can be equally abused as a means of protecting inefficient industries and thereby stifling market competition. The importing countries routinely try to find ways to inflate the duties imposed. In jute’s case, it is ironic that Indian consumers will end up paying more. In Nepal’s eyes, India is being protectionist. India will probably argue it is levelling the playing field.Protectionism comes in many shades—primarily tariffs, quotas and subsidies. They are all aimed at defending domestic companies by making foreign goods more expensive or scarce. It is practised globally. Nowhere is this more visible currently than in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. China has ascended quickly to become the largest producer and exporter of these vehicles. There are nearly 100 EV companies there. The Chinese government’s subsidies—direct (cash incentives) or indirect (interest-free loans, tax breaks, among others)—to solar panels, EVs and lithium-ion batteries are well-known. Overcapacity at home forces these manufacturers to look for opportunities abroad, stoking trade tensions.The right industrial policyFor consumers, this means lower prices. In the March quarter, China’s BYD—known for its affordable four-wheelers—surpassed Tesla to become the top seller of EVs globally. But for the US and European auto manufacturers, with decades of history and leadership, it translates to fear that they will be priced out. In the past, Europe used to lead in solar panel production; the industry was decimated by Chinese competition. Autos are a sensitive issue politically in both Europe and the United States. Both Brussels and Washington have repeatedly raised the issue of overcapacity in China and how this likely overwhelms factories in their countries. As an antidote, tariffs on Chinese EVs increasingly look likely.A few Chinese EV companies are already building factories in Mexico, which is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement. This comes at a time when the US itself is incentivising domestic production of EVs, EV batteries, chips, etc., which it views as strategic. China, in fact, recently filed a complaint with the WTO contesting discriminatory subsidy policies for EVs under the Joe Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act—one of three major investment bills passed since November 2021 with billions of dollars in loans, grants and tax credits targeted at reviving the country’s productivity, innovation and manufacturing base. Risks of tariffs are forcing companies to start producing in the US. Tariffs run the risk of provoking counter-tariffs. For a tiny country like ours, which is trade-dependent on its big neighbours, these dynamics are different. Using the case of jute as an example, there is nothing Nepal can do about it except take it lying down. Nepal imports most of the raw jute used to make jute products from India and Bangladesh, so there is no competitive advantage. It is a cliché, but it is also worth repeating. The policymakers should strive for an industrial policy that promotes products with a competitive edge and stick to it no matter who occupies Singha Durbar. It is equally important for Nepal to devote resources to finding alternative markets. \nAs the midsummer mercury rises, storing fresh food remains a challenge. In a country where the usage of refrigerators remains limited to urban areas, there is a risk of food getting contaminated. Moreover, our general attitude towards food safety and preservation, especially in eateries, is casual. For instance, we see meat shops openly displaying raw meat items all day on tables and showcases, without the use of freezers. Sweet shops and restaurants are no better, as they are tempted to display their food items to attract customers. Even though the food might look appealing to our eyes when it is served in eateries, it is ultimately harmful to our health as many do not follow the proper food safety protocols. The open display of food items invites bacteria and dust contamination, apart from the obvious heat-related hazards, leading to the onslaught of various diseases, including cholera and food poisoning, apart from a lack of nutrition. Although Nepal has food safety regulations in place, the lack of implementation and monitoring continues to pose the risk of food-borne diseases to the public. The Food Act, 2023 (1967) prohibits the production, sale or distribution of adulterated foodstuff or sub-standard foodstuff. By adulterated foodstuff, the Act means \"foodstuffs rotten so as to be harmful to health, or prepared or kept in a filthy or toxic condition\". In January last year, Nepal implemented a new set of food safety regulations, which has provisions for the careful production, processing, packaging, handling, storage and supply purity of food. The regulations also have provisions for labelling the food, including its nutritional value.However, apart from poor implementation of such regulations, the monitoring of the regulations is almost non-existent. In rare instances when food inspectors from municipalities bother to monitor the food in eateries, there is a high chance of such eateries being found flouting the regulations. For instance, in Kathmandu, as in most parts of the country, food items, especially items like meat that get contaminated quickly, are laid out in the open and sold. This causes great health risks, but the authorities of all levels of government seem either oblivious to or uninterested in the issue. In Kathmandu Metropolitan City, for instance, the authorities' focus is on removing the food vendors altogether, guided by a flawed notion of gentrification rather than regulating them under tax and food safety regimes. In other parts of the country, hardly anyone bothers to check the quality of food provided to customers.The state cannot remain a mute spectator when the health of the citizens is put at risk due to the carelessness of vendors. Rather, the state should strictly maintain food safety standards regularly—not in an episodic pattern, such as during festivals or at the whims of authorities but as a standard practice. Some basic steps include making it mandatory for vendors to keep appropriate food items in freezers, use covering, and segregate food items to avoid cross-contamination. As the culture of eating out is becoming increasingly common, especially among young people, the state should actively enforce food preservation and safety regulations to keep the citizens healthy. \n20 arrest warrants issued in Nepal Children's Organization land lease scam investigation involving former office bearers and business representatives.\nKedar Karki's unsteady hold on power in Koshi Province ends after coalition partners withdraw support, highlighting the decline of democratic values in Nepali politics and the power grab prevalent in provinces.\nThe United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal discusses Nepal's sociopolitical changes, LDC graduation challenges, SDG progress, Investment Summit support, development cooperation framework, climate change impacts, peace process status, and Nepal's role in UN and other global platforms amidst global polarization.\nThe upcoming budget session of Nepal's federal parliament faces uncertainty due to ongoing disputes over forming a committee to investigate allegations against Deputy Prime Minister Rabi Lamichhane, with the government aiming to pass crucial bills and improve parliament's productivity.\nNumerous fire incidents in various districts have displaced people, caused property loss, and resulted in nine fatalities, highlighting the inadequacy of current fire prevention measures due to insufficient rainfall, increased temperatures, and wind conditions.\nNepal's third Investment Summit aims to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by presenting investment opportunities, addressing obstacles from previous summits, and promoting Nepal's investor-friendly environment through legal amendments, simplified profit repatriation, and a focus on energy and hydropower.\nPolitical parties’ unhealthy activities to form provincial governments has taken the form of an ugly competition and increased the public’s frustration with the provinces. Separately, leaders of major political parties have started to blame the mixed electoral system for Nepal’s perpetual instability. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to political analyst Tula Narayan Shah to discuss these and other related issues.Nepali politics has entered yet another phase of endless bickering over power after the March 4 change of the ruling coalition. Politicians have resorted to every possible tactic to get leadership in provincial governments. How do you analyse this trend?I am not surprised. It is natural in the kind of parliamentary system that we practise. We adopted the parliamentary model in federal and provincial levels while the one at our local level is similar to the presidential system. Local unit chiefs and deputies are elected directly by the people and they can serve five-year terms. That has ensured stability there. Provincial governments on the other hand are destabilised when there is any change at the centre.Leaders have started blaming the electoral system for hung parliaments and instability. Is the problem in the system or with our leaders?Some senior leaders in major parties now blame the electoral system. Even the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Office of the Auditor General have recommended changes in the electoral model, arguing that the current one had promoted corruption in the country. I am not convinced. Politicians argue that no political party could garner a majority in this system and that led to instability. I rather hold politicians’ personal ambition and corrupt political culture responsible. General secretary of a major political party recently argued that it will be better for national politics to be driven by two political parties. Nepal conducted eight general elections (in 1959, in 1991, in 1994, in 1999, in 2008, in 2013, in 2017 and in 2022) under a multi-party system. Forget the 1959 polls. Of the three polls held in the 1990s, the Nepali Congress got majority in 1991 and 1999. Also, during those years, two parties—the Congress and the CPN-UML—dominated Nepali politics. Did a single-party majority and dominance of two parties provide stability? Not at all. Rather, personal rivalries of the Congress leaders invited instability. Fast forward to 2017 elections. The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance and jointly fought elections. They later merged to form the Nepal Communist Party, which had a comfortable majority. Again the rivalry of the top leaders within the party caused instability. These instances show that a majority for a single party doesn’t necessarily translate into stability.I rather see a conspiracy behind blaming the electoral system. In the 1990s, Nepal adopted the first-past-the-post system to elect all lawmakers. Around 70 percent national seats were controlled by two castes—Brahmin and Chhetri. In 2008, we adopted a mixed electoral system, which was a demand of the 2006 people’s movement, the Maoist insurgency and the Madhesh agitation. The proportional representation category significantly increased representation of women, dalits, Madheshi and indigenous communities in the legislature, whereas the representation of the males of Khas-Arya groups, who were historically ruling the country, decreased drastically.Who are those elected the most under the FPTP system?The FPTP electoral system has certain attributes that are more conducive to some groups than others. ‘High-caste males’ win more elections. Females have less of a chance. But dalits also have less chance even if the candidate is male. Those like contractors, landlords and businesspeople who can freely spend win elections. Likewise, those who are well-connected with the power centres in Kathmandu can influence elections. Chhetris and Thakuris were dominant in Panchayat politics. Brahmins got stronger after the 1990 political change. Also those who have access and visibility in media and other public forums have better chances of being elected under the FPTP.Some leaders who have these capabilities have won elections in different systems. There is one Madheshi leader, who won election in Panchayat, got tickets from Congress and won again in the multiparty system. Later he joined a Madhesh-based party and won. So, high-caste males and those with access to power corridors in Kathmandu want FPTP. Whereas, women, dalits and those from marginalised communities prefer PR.A general perception is that those who are directly elected are competent ones and can deliver whereas those from the PR category are there just for the sake of representation. Do you agree?Leaders didn’t pick the candidates properly under the PR category. They picked their loved or loyal ones or sold these seats for hefty monetary returns. Leaders from Madheshi and indigenous communities fought for this system. But the same Madheshi leaders kept the names of their wives, daughters and other family members at the top of the PR list. Thus leaders misused and defamed the electoral system. So, the debate should be focused on correcting the wrong practices, not scrapping the system itself.Provinces replicated all the wrong practices of the centre and did even worse.We adopted the same parliamentary system in provinces. So the same thing happened there. Conversely, local units are different as the system there is different. Therefore, we have to go for directly elected executive heads at the centre as well as provinces. Let’s elect the prime minister and chief ministers directly. That will give us stability. Senior leaders from the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre have proposed changing the electoral system but they haven’t proposed direct election of the prime minister and chief ministers. So, the solution is direct election of executive heads, as in Palikas. Scrapping of the PR system won’t help.What if a wrong person gets elected to the post and can’t be removed for five years?In a democracy, you have to trust the people. Nepali citizens are the ones who removed monarchy. Can’t they unseat a leader elected by their votes? In a direct election, even a person from outside the political parties may emerge. So, politicians are afraid because traditionally they exert control over candidacy and various other things through the parties. Many think of provinces as an unnecessary burden on state coffers. Is that the case?I don’t think so. State restructuring was one of the major demands of the Maoist insurgency, Madhesh movement and the 2006 People’s Movement. Why did they ask for it? Because Nepal was a heavily centralised state and it wasn’t inclusive. Federalisation of the state, inclusive electoral system and reservation quotas in civil service were the three components of state restructuring.But why did the provinces then fail to deliver and win public trust?The stakeholders spent around a decade deciding what type of provinces should be carved out. Even pro-federalists didn’t debate how to make the provinces functional. Those who lobbied in favour of the federal system have now become defensive. Some are silent. The political party [which is led by Upendra Yadav] that fought for the federal system has been leading the government in Madhesh for the past six years. But they haven’t given any relief to the common people through the provincial government. People have an impression that the provincial system has added corruption and it is only for the leaders and their cronies, not the common people.Are the leaders really corrupt or do they lack efficiency?Even the Maoist and Madheshi parties that promised to be different to the Congress and the UML couldn’t come up with a roadmap to make the federal system and state agencies more meaningful for the people. They only indulged in power politics, just like other parties. That frustrated the people.You recently travelled to various parts of Madhesh province. How are the sub-national administrations working and what is the public mood there?A society where people are aware, educated and active helps make leaders as well as administration accountable. Authorities are found to be working arbitrarily in the places where people can’t question their wrongdoing. We find relatively better administration in the mid-hill regions, where Brahmins and Chhetris have dominant presence as they have better understanding of the system, laws and other information. Such a mid-hill area expands from the eastern border to Lumbini Province. In this belt, people can raise questions and make the administration accountable. Women’s status is better while caste-based discrimination is less. Local units, schools, health posts, and administrative units work well. Conversely, these aspects are weak in Karnali, Sudurpaschim, inner Madhesh and in the northern belt as there is no critical mass capable of questioning the authorities.You should understand that there are two Madhesh belts. One is along the East-West Highway, second is the bordering area. The belt along the highway has a diverse social composition. There is dominance of the people who migrated from the hills. Development indicators are better and so is the presence of state agencies. The more you move south, the more you find homogenous populations of Madheshi origin. Traditional power relations haven’t changed there. Patron-client dynamics still stand. Certain individuals have key roles in elections and other important activities. They take the decision on behalf of other common people. We find similar practice in the northern belt as well but not in the mid-hill and highway areas.Many say local units perform better than provinces. What is the perception on the ground?Local level is equipped with needed authority. Provinces should be given powers to make them effective as per the spirit of federalism. The present system was designed by reluctant federalists. Therefore, what we need is a fresh debate on the reforms of provinces. There are two conflicting claims. A section of the society says provinces have misused their authority and failed to deliver. Others say the provinces need more authority for effective functioning.It is true that provinces have failed to use the authority they have. Provinces have their legislatures that prepare their budgets and their governments can implement it. Give me an example of an exemplary and innovative initiative taken by any of the seven provinces in the past six years. Madhesh Province started the ‘Beti Padhau Beti Bachau’ campaign but corruption doomed it. People started raising questions, “why do we need provinces, if the leaders there are to copy the same corrupt activities of the centre?”Madheshi leaders opposed the hill people’s dominance and discriminatory practices in the central administration. But the same Madheshi leaders aren’t promoting an inclusive system in Madhesh. Around 20 percent of the total Madhesh population are dalits. The government in the province has changed multiple times. But how many dalits have been ministers in the provincial Cabinets? There are 136 local units in Madhesh Province. But only one mayor and two deputy-mayors are from the dalit community. Just like a set of elite people has captured Kathmandu’s politics, another set of elites has captured the politics of Janakpur.How do Madheshi people look at provinces?People in Kathmandu, mid-hills, and some other places can be heard saying provinces should be scrapped. Common people in Madhesh don’t say so. But they have dissatisfaction with the parties who championed the federal system. They say, “our lives are the same even in the federal system”.How do you analyse the performance of two new parties in Madhesh—Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti?Overall, three parties emerged from the 2022 elections. The Rastriya Swatantra Party emerged from the areas with a dominant presence of hill people. The Janamat Party won from eastern Tarai and the Nagarik Unmukti Party from the western part of the southern belt. The Janamat says the agenda of discrimination against Madhesh is still relevant but they oppose the leadership of the Janata Samajbadi Party and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The old Madheshi parties spoke against Kathmandu’s discrimination but they themselves didn’t work to remove discrimination when they led the government in Madhesh. Besides, they didn’t speak against bad governance. Now, the Janamat’s agenda is to fight discrimination and bad governance, both by Kathmandu as well as the old Madheshi parties.The RSP’s emergence is against “the bad governance of the Congress and the UML”. Its major agenda is good governance. It doesn’t care about discrimination. But bad governance isn’t an agenda of Nagarik Unmukti. The party that emerged mainly after the Tikapur incident is against the discrimination of Tharu community. The dispute in the party is family-based and the outfit hasn’t taken the form of a political party. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nSinohydro refutes a news report claiming they failed to pay taxes on construction materials for the Melamchi Water Supply Project; they used legal sources and recycled materials, and have paid all vendors and suppliers.\nJapan's labor market opened to Nepali workers in 2019, but there are misunderstandings regarding government involvement, the role of agencies, and financial responsibilities that require clarification.\nMichael Hutt expresses gratitude for Deepak Thapa's concerns about Nepali studies in Euro-America, acknowledges Krishna Pradhan's contributions at SOAS, and laments the decline of Nepali studies in the UK due to Pradhan's retirement and the discontinuation of related courses.\nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.
