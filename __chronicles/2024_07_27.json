Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal’s private sector has been sailing in troubled waters. The central bank responded to the problem experienced for the past two fiscal years by easing monetary policy and cutting rates to keep credit flowing. For the first time, the bank has admitted that the country suffered an “economic slowdown” for two consecutive years.The private sector welcomed the monetary policy for the fiscal year 2024–25, unveiled by Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari on Friday. The policy aims to ramp up support for the economy, which has been slowing, said Adhikari. “The policy targets gradual economic recovery by controlling inflation, stabilising interest rates, and ensuring credit demand.”The central bank said monetary policy had transitioned to an “easing, cautious” mode to address the demand of the private sector, which is the driver of economic growth.With easing measures, the central bank expects a double-digit private sector credit growth, increasing by 12.5 percent year-on-year in 2024-25.“The monetary policy is favourable for the private sector. It aims at economic recovery through productive use of private-sector credit,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. “There was a problem. Money had piled up in banks, and businesses were not getting it to invest. The policy has untied the knot.”The central bank said the private sector pumped Rs5.27 trillion into the economy in the last fiscal year, which ended on July 15. This accounts for 92 percent of Nepal’s economy.The growth of the construction sector also stalled in the period. In the last fiscal year, the sector, with a contribution of 5.41 percent to the economy, is projected to have dropped to 2.07 percent. To address the sector’s grievances, the monetary policy has extended the interest payment deadline for contractors to November.“It’s welcoming, though it is late,” said Rabi Singh, president of the Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal. “But this is just a temporary arrangement.”“We had recommended the government for recapitalisation of the loans and interest for 2 to 5 years to stabilise the construction industry’s capital structure,” he said.The government defaulted on payment for contractors, forcing hundreds of projects to halt and eventually cause the construction sector, one of the key economic indicators, to enter a recession. “Still, we need the assurance of enough cash flow for the development of the critical infrastructure, which is also the basis for jobs creation.”Singh said the construction sector has been working on projects amounting to Rs600 billion.The central bank said the measures to cut interest rates are intended to enhance market liquidity and support economic activity in a low-inflation environment. The upper ceiling interest rate corridor has been decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 6.5 percent, and the policy rate has been reduced by 0.5 percent, to 5 percent.According to market analysts, if banks’ interest rates are low, people generally tend to invest. This will allow liquidity injections in the market without it being absorbed by the banks and the central bank.The monetary policy stated that the high liquidity in the banking system would support businesses and individuals and ease the difficulties of the private sector.The central bank said mobilising the banks’ liquidity through the private sector would support the federal government’s ambitious economic growth target. “This monetary policy will help us reach the 6 percent economic growth targeted by the federal government by keeping inflation at around 5 percent,” said Governor Adhikari. He said the central bank would manage liquidity and inject capital into the productive sector to achieve the target growth.According to the annual account estimates by the National Statistics Office, Nepal’s economic growth was estimated at 3.87 percent in the last fiscal year, in an optimistic scenario.The World Bank said in its April Nepal Development Update that economic growth is projected to accelerate to 4.6 percent in the current fiscal year, a way below the government target.“This recovery is largely attributed to the easing of monetary policy, assuming the productive use of private-sector credit,” the multilateral funding agency said. “Private sector credit contracted in the last fiscal year due to the tighter regulation on working capital loans, high lending rates, and weak domestic demand.”“The reforms to improve the business environment could attract more private investment,” according to the World Bank.On Friday, the central bank announced it would review the current working capital loans guideline. Banks and financial institutions offer short-term working capital loans to finance a company’s everyday operations.At present, industrialists and businesspeople get working capital loans of up to 25 percent of their annual turnover.For those taking more working capital loans than the set threshold, the deadline for borrowers to repay the excess credit has been extended to mid-July 2025. The central bank said it aims to maintain seven months of forex reserves to cover goods and services imports in the ongoing fiscal year 2024-25. The central bank said it would coordinate with the government to formulate necessary laws to regulate and supervise savings and credit cooperatives.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged a risk to Nepal’s economy that could trigger social unrest if the ongoing cooperatives problems are not sorted out.It said that several cooperatives have collapsed in the past six months, causing a loss or freezing of client savings and creating small-scale social unrest. The IMF warned that problems in the savings and cooperatives sector are expanding.The leading cause of the failure is investment in illiquid and underperforming cooperatives’ assets, which impact repayment capacity, combined with some cases of fraud.The monetary policy said it would facilitate the government’s initiative to return Rs500,000 to each cooperatives depositor by recovering them from the directors’ properties.With a growing number of companies being blacklisted, the central bank said it had worked out a policy for the companies that are associated with the blacklisted companies but have not committed any offence.Under the policy, if one firm is blacklisted in a joint venture, it will not be mandatory to keep the other in the bad book if it has committed no offence.At present, if a person or organisation that is blacklisted owns 15 percent or more shares in any other firm, personally or institutionally, the director and executive head of such a firm or company can also be blacklisted. The central bank said it would provide collateral-free loans to migrant workers based on the assurance that remittances would be sent to the bank accounts in their home country.The NRB has extended the deadline for loan repayment to microfinance customers who failed to pay loans under various circumstances. Monetary policy has increased the limit on home loans. The bank said that the limit on home loans taken for the first time would be increased to Rs25 million from Rs20 million. It has increased the foreign exchange limit for Demand Draft/Telex Transfer facilities when importing goods to $50,000 from the existing $35,000.The existing limit for importing goods through ‘document against payment’ and ‘document against acceptance’ has been increased from $60,000 to $100,000.The monetary policy has removed the limit on share mortgage loans for institutions, which is currently Rs200 million. However, no new provision has been made on personal or individual loan limits. Currently, the share mortgage loan limit for individuals is Rs150 million, and individual share investors have been demanding an increase in this limit.  \nThe three-party mechanism formed to iron out differences on the amendment bill to Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act has decided to submit its report to the top leaders of three major political parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre—but only after final rounds of consultations with the stakeholders.A meeting of the mechanism comprising Ramesh Lekhak of the Nepali Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the CPN-UML, and Janardan Sharma of the Maoist Centre, on Friday claimed that they are very close to an ‘agreement in principle’. On Monday, the mechanism will hold discussions with Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Ajay Kumar Chaurasiya, secretary at the ministry, chairperson of the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the lower house, and secretaries of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. “We are very close to an agreement. The report will be submitted after discussions with stakeholders,” said Sharma, adding that the 18-year-long stalemate in the transitional justice process will soon end.The top leadership of the major parties had on July 1 constituted the three-member committee after the House committee, despite repeated attempts, failed to find a consensus on four key issues in the bill. After a month-long negotiation, the three-member mechanism has claimed to have found a way forward. It has agreed to classify arbitrary killings as serious violations of human rights, and reduce the sentencing by around 75 percent for those who cooperate in the investigation process.If Sharma’s claim is anything to go by, they aim to address the issue of former Maoist child soldiers by providing compensation while also ensuring reparations and relief for the families of security personnel who lost their lives or were injured during the insurgency.Members of the mechanism say they are finalising the process with victims’ interests at the forefront. However, both human rights activists and conflict victims have strongly objected to the agreement to reduce the punishment for serious violations of human rights by three-fourths. The agreement on reduced sentencing came weeks after the National Human Rights Commission came up with a similar recommendation. It said the jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws.“It seems the National Human Rights Commission is being used by the political leadership,” said Suman Adhikari, founding chairperson of the Conflict Victims Common Platform. Similarly, a group of human rights activists organised under the Accountability Watch Group, also has said it is inappropriate to legally bind the judiciary to grant excessive immunity to those guilty of committing serious crimes by mandating reduced sentences. They argue that this undermines judicial independence and the victims’ right to effective legal remedy. While not entirely opposed to reduced sentencing, they demand that this specific provision be scrapped.The members of the mechanism say everyone should move ahead with the aim of settling the national issue. “We are working with a goal to get the bill endorsed from the ongoing session of Parliament,” said Bartaula. The House committee will finalise the bill based on the agreement reached in the three-member panel. It then needs to be endorsed by both the chambers of the federal parliament.The amendment bill was registered in the House of Representatives in March last year and sent to the parliamentary committee for finalisation. After over a year of discussions, the parliamentary committee narrowed down the differences to four points. There had been a broader understanding on two points—to classify arbitrary killings as serious violation of human rights (thus non-amnestiable), and to allow victims, who refuse to reconcile, to seek prosecution. However, other issues remained unaddressed, prompting the major parties to form the three-member panel. \nDrinking water samples collected from the “Drugs-Free Society”, a Thaiba-based rehab hit by a cholera outbreak, have tested positive for faecal coliform.Officials at the Health Office Lalitpur, have reported the presence of the deadly microbes in all water samples including those from the water utility and well water.“Faecal coliform, a deadly microbe, has been detected in all water samples from the cholera-hit rehab,”said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. “We have started chlorinating the water to tackle the contamination.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. The presence of faecal coliform means that the drinking water being used by locals of Thaiba is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.At least four people had tested positive for cholera that spread in the Thaiba-based rehab earlier this week.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Of the four infected patients, one in serious condition was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu. Another patient, who was admitted in the same hospital, was discharged on Wednesday, but has not gone home because the rehab has closed and he has nowhere else to go. Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As monsoon season is an epidemic season, in which most sources of drinking water get contaminated, presence of deadly microbes—E coli, faecal coliform in drinking water is not unusual during the monsoon season, health officials say. Even jar water, which is widely considered safer compared to water from other sources, gets contaminated during the monsoon season.What concerns them much is the apathy of the responsible agencies in launching awareness drives about the risks and other preventive measures. Most local authorities across the country halted testing of drinking water just before the start of monsoon citing budget constraints.Doctors say this is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved significantly.“Consumption of water contaminated with human faeces causes diarrheal infections,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Whatever the source, one must ensure that water is safe before drinking.”According to Basaula, the number of diarrheal cases has started rising in the hospital, and contaminated water and food are the main culprits. He said there are chances of outbreaks of diarrheal infections in multiple places where water from contaminated sources is being distributed.“Around six diarrheal patients seek treatment in our hospital every day,” said Basaula. “One must be careful about the quality of food and water before consumption.”Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the chances of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.Initiating awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from water-borne diseases, according to them. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of infection, they say. \nNepal’s judo player Manita Shrestha Pradhan will face Marica Perisic of Serbia in the women’s 57 kg weight category Elimination Round of 32 at the Paris Olympics on Monday.Shrestha Pradhan has been drawn in Pool A in the women’s judo competition which will be held at the Grand Palais Ephemere in Paris.If Shrestha Pradhan beats the Serbian, she will meet the winners between Mariama Koroma of Sierra Leone and Lien Chen-ling of Chinese Taipei in the round of 16.Shrestha Pradhan secured her place at the Olympics through continental quota based on Olympic point rankings.Nepal has sent seven athletes to Paris 2024.Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha and badminton’s Prince Dahal are in action on Saturday.Nepal is making its debut in both badminton and table tennis in Paris.Santoo, who is the only third Nepali player to qualify for the Olympics via qualification tournament after taekwondo’s Sangina Baidya (Athens 2004) and Deepak Bista (Beijing 2008), will face Diaw Ibrahima of Senegal in the men’s singles preliminary round.Santoo will progress to the round of 16 if he beats Ibrahima.Dahal, who entered the Paris 2024 on universality spot, will meet world number two Viktor Axelsen of Denmark in his opening game of Group P, which also includes Ireland’s Nhat Nguyen and Israel’s Misha Zilberman.A total of 41 players (from 36 countries)—split into 13 groups of three or four—are competing in the men’s singles badminton.

And this requires that we be autonomous individuals, free spirits, rejecting the restrictions that society and conventional morality seek to impose.”The above paragraph is an extract from AC Grayling’s book ‘The History of Philosophy’. The passage rightly encapsulates the essence of the ongoing exhibition at Nepal Art Council, ‘Rasa Lila: The Divine Dance.’‘Rasa Lila’ embodies everything unconventional and unique. It doesn't conform to typical norms but instead aligns with the authentic way an individual is likely to perceive things. The artists behind the exhibition are Priyam Pradhan, Utsab BS Pradhan, Urza Acharya, Binit Maharjan, Julian Shakya, Smarika Phuyal, Shristika Yonzon, and Shubi Lama, who hail from diverse disciplines. The show is unlike any other exhibition in Kathmandu. For instance, the regular clay sculptures have been replaced by carbon steel sculptures and the use of jenga blocks, and the installed headphones act as a phone booth for the emotions embodied in the statues.Moreover, the adjustment of light is done so skillfully that it creates the illusion of multiplying the presented figures, adding dynamism to its display.As I perceived, the theme of the exhibition revolves around fusing the contemporary world with the mythological world of Mahabharata.Jawaharlal Nehru, in his book ‘The Discovery of India’, mentions that myths provide insights into the thoughts and emotions of people throughout history, reflecting their aspirations, fears, and societal norms.In a similar vein, with its aim to compare the myths of yesterday with today’s spectacle, the angles used in creating this exhibition represent contemporary perspectives, offering a fresh interpretation of timeless narratives such as Mahabharata itself. One of the artists, Priyam Pradhan, who is ready to start his academic life abroad, said, “This exhibition marks the celebration of departure and acceptance of the fact that we will have to move away and find our footing in the world.”Similar to his saying, the exhibition makes the spectators enter the world of Vraja, the highest domain of the heavenly world. Examining the atmosphere of the exhibition, the descriptions of the exhibit labels come to life, providing a sense of calmness and serenity as they begin their observation.The story of the exhibition begins with Krishna dancing with the Gopis before he leaves to fulfil his duty of freeing his birth parents from the claws of Kamsa, his uncle and the tyrant ruler of Mathura.While Krishna is fully absorbed in performing ‘Rasa Lila’, Shiva, along with his consort Parvati, arrives to participate in the dance. However, Shiva is restricted from participating. The lack of ‘Sakhibhav’—seeing onset as a companion or friend of the divine—prevents Shiva from joining in the celebration.As somebody who was educated in an all-girls school, this particular instance transported me back to my school days, making me home-sick of the strong bond that I shared with my girlfriends.Contrary to my current environment, which lacks that understanding and connection, especially with boys, this feeling of nostalgia gets well articulated in the concept of Sakibhav.Adamant to participate in the zesty celebration, Shiva turns himself into Gopeshwor Mahadev, a beautiful maiden who can take part in the ‘Rasa Lila’.With ghungroo tinkling in a feminine foot contrasted with the depiction of masculine dancing hands, the structure cleverly illustrates Gopeshwor Mahadev dancing with the Gopis.The holy Yamuna river, flowing beside the beautiful Vraja, has symbolic meaning according to the way it is presented in the exhibition. The river is scattered with the jumbled letters of the names of the exhibition's creators, hinting at civilization's ever-flowing nature.Just like the scattered letters represent the intertwined history, the river has long absorbed the ashes of people from various backgrounds. This makes one realise that nature is not to be owned but to be appreciated and preserved. The exhibition also represents Draupadi’s vastraharan (disrobing). In the dramatic episode of the Indian Epic, Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, is humiliated in the Kaurava court after the Pandavas lose a game of dice to the Kauravas.As a punishment, the Kaurava prince Dushasana tries to disrobe Draupadi, but Lord Krishna provides her with an endless supply of cloth, preventing her from being stripped.However, while Draupadi suffers indignity, her family members remain tight-lipped and do nothing on their part to save her from the plight she is facing.A white saree symbolises Draupadi’s ordeal, and the ending of her saree after being saved by Lord Krishna is depicted in blue. A red light on the head of the statue represents Draupadi's anger towards her family members. Similarly, to help spectators truly connect with Draupadi's plight, a song by artist Smarika Phuyal has been installed in the exhibition, which spectators can listen to from headphones.Rather than concentrating on the well-known discourse of Draupadi’s plight as a ‘Damsel in Distress’, the exhibition highlights a new perspective. It calls out the paradoxical nature of today's people, who claim to uphold morals and ethics while frequently acting against these principles.Likewise, blending contemporary fashion with classical mythology, the exhibition offers a fresh representation of the Pandavas. The innovative approach of representing the Pandava brothers with t-shirts of different colours is something that one rarely comes across in an exhibition.The exhibition has also made a substantial effort to showcase the predicament of modern-day Draupadi through a documentary presentation.Documentarian Urza Acharya outlines the theme of her documentary, “One cannot always dwell on happy moments. To enjoy the true embrace of delightful times, one must partake in the adventure of life, which has its challenges and less exciting aspects.” The five-minute documentary titled ‘God of Small Things’ revolves around the inner turmoil of the protagonist, who is dressed in a pink dress with tinkling ghungroos.She often pendulums between two extremes leaving a grey area. The grey area is marked with her being close with herself through the performance of mundane and small tasks.“By fixing small things, I am confronted with my honest self, the small things end up fixing me too.”In an era where a person’s identity is often recognised by great achievements attained through complying with the set standards of society, the documentary provides a respite from this routine.It instead voices the perspective that the pursuit of greatness shouldn’t be one’s core conquest in life. There is a profound wholeness to be discovered in the mundane.To sum up, from a philosophical perspective, the exhibition can be compared to Neitzche’s pressing question, “How were we to find meaning and purpose in a post-religious world?”Just like philosopher Heidegger developed a new approach to address Nietzche’s question, the eight artists of this exhibition offer a fresh perspective on interpreting mythologies.The eight artists in this exhibition do not reject religious traditions; instead, they provide contemporary insights that reinterpret and breathe new life into these narratives.In this way, the exhibition serves as a modern response to age-old questions, blending classical themes with innovative approaches to offer viewers a deeper understanding of both past and present.Rasa Lila: The Divine DanceWhere: Nepal Art Council, BabarmahalTimings: 10:00 am to 5:00 pmEntry: FreeTill August 3 \nNepal will launch their CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League campaign against Sri Lanka at the National Sports Council covered hall in Kathmandu on August 1, the opening day of the tournament.Five countries—Hosts Nepal, India, the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Iran—are competing for the trophy.India are also in action against Iran on the opening day.Nepal next face India on August 2, the Maldives on August 4 and Iran on August 5.The top four teams will advance into the semi-finals, which are scheduled for August 6.The group winners of the single-round league will take on the fourth placed team, while the group-runners will lock horns with the third-placed team in the last four clashes.The final and the third-place playoff will be held on August 7.  \nThe Parliamentary Hearing Committee has scheduled its meeting for Monday to decide on election commissioner nominee Krishna Man Pradhan.According to Padma Prasad Pandey, the general secretary at the Federal Parliament secretariat, the committee meeting has been called at 11 am on Monday.The meeting of the Constitutional Council held on June 16 had recommended Pradhan for the post of election commissioner.The Council’s decision to nominate Pradhan for the constitutional body courted controversy after a woman filed a complaint at the hearing committee accusing Pradhan of sexually abusing her years. The woman, who was invited to a committee meeting, also narrated about the issue in detail to the committee members.The committee’s meeting held on Wednesday ended inconclusively citing further discussion was needed on the allegations made against the proposed commissioner.During the hearing, cross-party lawmakers asked Pradhan how he would defend the serious allegations of sexual abuse and whether he was morally corrupt. Most members of the 15-strong committee had asked him how he was eligible to hold the constitutional position despite the serious allegations.A two-thirds majority of the 15-strong committee, which has lawmakers from both chambers of Parliament, can reject the nomination. \nFamily members of 17 out of 18 people killed in the Saurya Airlines crash have received the bodies of their relatives as of Saturday evening.Relatives of the deceased, who had earlier refused to receive the bodies demanding that the government and airlines guarantee compensation and insurance issues first, accepted the bodies after the officials promised to address their concerns. According to Deputy Inspector General of Police Dan Bahadur Karki, all the bodies except for the body of Aref Reda, a Yemeni national, have been handed over to the family members.Most of the bodies were identified by Friday. However, there had been issues in identifying the severely charred bodies. A large team of doctors worked to identify the victims as quickly as possible, according to officials.Saurya Airlines officials have committed that the company would provide as much support as possible to the victims’ families.“We assure the victims’ families that we will provide all possible support and assistance,” Saurya Airlines Chairman Dipak Kumar Pokharel said in a statement on Friday.Eighteen of the 19 people aboard a Pokhara-bound aircraft of the Saurya Airlines died when the plane crashed shortly after it took off from the Tribhuvan International Airport on Wednesday.Captain Manish Ratna Shakya, the lone survivor of the crash, is recuperating at a hospital in Kathmandu.  \nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has its feet in two boats: Business and regulation. This is always a recipe for disaster. And in Nepal’s aviation sector, disasters are aplenty. Under the current director general, Pradeep Adhikari, Nepal has seen seven air crashes. In the past year-and-a-half alone, over 100 people have been killed in plane crashes. And no, the director-general hasn’t resigned yet, he in fact continues to vehemently defend his sullied record. The terms ‘accountability’ and ‘humility’ are clearly missing from his book of ethics. With the right connections across the political spectrum, he has no moral or political pressure to resign. The half-mast national flag does his task of hanging his head in shame.A European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) delegation that conducted an on-site assessment of Nepal’s air safety last September pointed out several safety concerns, clearly mentioning a couple of airline carriers and CAAN as the offending parties. An assessment report submitted to CAAN’s Adhikari raised concerns about discrepancies in the work of the Flight Operations Division and the Airworthiness Inspection Division. It noted significant gaps in overseeing fatigue related to duty period regulations and ensuring comprehensive compliance checks. The report also suggested improvement in CAAN’s oversight capabilities, personnel management, staff training and certification processes.How the CAAN has responded to the European Commission’s concerns about Nepal’s air safety over the years is there for all to see: More crashes and more killings. The commission’s request to bifurcate the civil aviation body into regulatory and service-providing institutions has fallen on deaf ears. Similarly, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Nations aviation watchdog, asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body and ensure a proper regulatory system two years ago. Not splitting the CAAN has created a serious conflict of interest as the same institution seeks to provide service as well as to make profit. However, Adhikari kept the report a secret, continuing to stall efforts to split CAAN.A poignant case of regulation failure was evident in the death of the wife and son of a technician who were among the 18 individuals killed in the Saurya Air crash near the runway of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on Wednesday. The ferry flight to Pokhara on a full maintenance mission was not supposed to carry common passengers, but it did—an egregious violation of air safety rules. As corruption and lack of accountability run rampant in Nepal’s aviation industry, with little adherence to existing regulations, air travel continues to be a risky endeavour.The captain of the ill-fated Bombardier CRJ200, who miraculously survived the crash, has made an initial statement that he could not control the aircraft after it took an altitude of a hundred feet after take-off. He would be in a position to provide more insight into the events leading up to the fatal crash of the aircraft when he regains his health. In Nepal, there has been a tradition of putting all the blame on human agency, meaning the captain, after all fatal air crashes, without making any effort to strengthen air safety regulations. No corrupt leader or bureaucrat should be allowed to perennially stop the bifurcation of CAAN and to continue to let our skies be aerial death traps.   \nUnintended pregnancy, teenage pregnancy and induced abortive procedures with complications are some common reproductive health problems affecting millions of females worldwide. These issues are major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity in South Asia, posing a significant challenge to women’s sexual and reproductive health as well as social well-being and economic prospects.In Nepal, nearly half of the pregnancies are unintended and 60 percent of them end up in abortion. This directly correlates with gender inequality, socio-economic status and restrictions on sexual and reproductive rights. Early and unintended pregnancies also pose a huge barrier to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3.7, which ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning, information and education and integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. Nepal's National Planning Commission 2020 states, \"The government of Nepal’s target for SDG 3.7.1, is that 74% of allwomen age 15–49 have a met need for family planning with modern methods by 2022 and 80% by 2030.\"Advancement of contraceptivesOver the past few decades, there have been tremendous advances in the development of new contraceptive technologies, and a wide variety of family planning methods have been introduced. According to the National Demographic Health Survey 2022 (NDHS), 57 percent of currently married women are using a method of contraception, 43 percent are using a modern technique, and 15 percent are using a traditional method. There has been a decline in the unmet need for family planning from 32 percent in 1996 to 21 percent in 2022, which is possibly due to contraceptives.While different methods of contraception have prevented unintended pregnancies, emergency contraceptives are on the rise today. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are safe and effective drugs, recommended to be used within 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse, after accidents like condom rupture or missed pills, or if women are forced against their will to prevent pregnancy. ECPs help women avoid the adverse outcomes of unwanted pregnancies and reduce the risk of induced abortion. Offering emergency contraception is a crucial service delivery intervention for reducing this unmet need for contraception. As the name itself says, emergency contraceptives are intended only for occasional and emergency use. Counselling for the use of these pills should include options for regular contraception and advice on the correct methods in cases of perceived method failure. Concerns regarding ECPsNepal first introduced emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) through a social marketing programme in 2004. Since then, its use has risen, particularly in the last decade. The serious concerns regarding the potential use of ECP as a substitute for other contraceptives are similar to those voiced in response to the increased use of abortion in Nepal. The increased availability of over-the-counter and easy accessibility of emergency contraceptives has raised concerns regarding their safe use, misuse and potential consequences. The trend of taking ECPs as an alternative method of contraception should be seriously considered, particularly among youth. The wide advertisements, banners and posters around street corners stating it is an “easy way to the difficult situation” have misled them to either abandon or consider not using the contraceptive method regularly. It provides easy options for women to avoid unwanted or unplanned births without having to face social stigmatisation.Globally, the increasing use of ECPs has been described as an epidemic in which women are reportedly “eating contraceptives like chocolates” in Kenya and “popping them like candy” in India. The condition is similar in the context of Nepal today, where the pills are taken as a substitute for regular contraceptives. It might replace the regular use of oral combined pills, which in turn can lead to menstrual irregularities because of off-and-on withdrawal bleeding. This problem not only harms women but also potentially increases sexually transmitted diseases (STI) and HIV when condom use is replaced by repeated, indiscriminate use of emergency contraceptives. It will also deprive young women and girls of reaching out to the gynaecologist for appropriate counselling services and to consider various options regarding regular contraceptives. There is no doubt that emergency contraceptives provide a woman with the opportunity to have unprotected intercourse and ensure that every pregnancy is wanted. However, repeated misuse of emergency contraceptives needs to be evaluated for a better understanding of the positive and negative impacts of ECPs, which is critical in guiding the discourse in the right direction. Existing policies lack comprehensive implementation guidelines for the distribution of emergency contraceptive pills, necessitating integration. Comprehensive sexual health programmes and education campaigns through social media, workshops, community outreach initiatives on reproductive health and family planning methods and emergency contraceptives should be conducted. Health education on ECPs should be integrated into the curriculum to bridge the knowledge gap among youths. Similarly, equipping teachers to offer detailed sex education in urban and rural schools, incorporating public education campaigns to raise awareness about ECPs and their importance as a backup method of contraception, integrating counselling services into healthcare settings, and enhancing the competencies of paramedics, community leaders and female community health volunteers to provide basic adolescent services are urgently needed. The media, programme implementors, service providers, decision-makers and policymakers should have the right and accurate information on ECPs. There is an urgent need to disseminate information regarding family planning, pregnancy risks and contraceptive use to dispel myths and ensure the proper use of ECPs. An integrated approach is required to address the interrelated factors and create an enabling environment in which adolescents are fully aware, informed and equipped to properly utilise contraceptives and related services. As Jeff Sheffield, chairman of FIGO’s Contraception and Family Planning Committee, said, “Globally, young people, especially adolescents, do not have access to reliable, up-to-date information related to sexual and reproductive health, including contraception. This information can help inform their decisions and potentially save lives.” Let’s ponder this issue seriously.  \nNepal boasts a history of 110 years of undertaking decennial population censuses, starting from 1911. The recent Nepal Population and Housing Census (NPHC), conducted from November 11 to 25, 2021, is the 12th in this series. The initial four censuses, conducted before 1950, are not considered scientific. However, the censuses conducted after 1952-54 have been meticulously designed to generate valuable statistics and indicators. These indicators assess the situation of various special population groups, including women, children, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities and migrants, as well as changes over time. The 2021 census holds particular significance as it was conducted after the nation incorporated a federal government. This transition marked a new era in Nepal’s administrative and political landscape. Additionally, the 2021 census was completed after numerous setbacks and reorganisations brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. Initially scheduled for June 8 to 22, 2021, the dates were postponed to November 11 to 25, 2021 due to pandemic-induced disruptions.Wealth indexAn index is a statistical technique used to combine various indicators into a single numerical score, simplifying complex data into an easily interpretable format. Composite scores are commonly used to monitor and evaluate the performance of different issues. In this context, the performance of the census findings is assessed using the wealth index. The \"wealth index\" was calculated using household characteristics, service utilities and amenities data from the NPHC 2021. This method is widely recognised for constructing such indices. The wealth index is based on 17 factors, including nine household assets, four services and four dwelling quality variables. These factors are the materials used in the foundation of the house, outer wall, roof, floor, the main source of drinking water, usual fuel for cooking and lighting and toilet facility, availability and type of toilet facility. The nine household assets include television, landline phone, smartphone, computer/laptop, internet, car/jeep/van, motorcycle/scooter, refrigerator and washing machine. These indices were estimated and presented in the given table: The wealth distribution data reveals significant disparities across Nepal's provinces. More than half of the households in Karnali (51.3 percent) were in the poorest quintile, while only 4 percent were in the wealthiest. Similarly, one-third (33.9 percent) of households from Sudurpashchim were in the poorest quintile, compared to eight percent in the richest. In contrast, two-fifths (38 percent) of households in Bagmati were in the richest quintile, highlighting a stark contrast with provinces like Madhesh, where only nine percent of households were in the richest category. Implications for policy and planning The wealth distribution data from the 2021 census provides essential insights for targeted policy interventions. The pronounced economic disparities necessitate a multifaceted approach to fostering equitable development across Nepal. Infrastructure development necessitates investing in basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity and water supply in poorer regions, which can significantly improve living standards and economic opportunities. Education and healthcare seek enhanced access to quality education; healthcare is crucial for long-term socioeconomic upliftment. These services are foundational for human capital development, which in turn drives economic growth. Economic policies require implementing policies aimed at boosting local economies, such as promoting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and improving market access for local products, which can stimulate economic activity and job creation. Leveraging strengths Wealthier provinces like Bagmati serve as models for successful economic strategies that can be adapted and implemented in less developed regions. To prevent further widening of regional disparities, it is essential to ensure that the benefits of wealth in these provinces are equally distributed. A balanced approach that addresses the needs of poorer regions while leveraging the strengths of wealthier areas can promote more inclusive and sustainable growth across Nepal. Likewise, continuous monitoring and evaluation of socioeconomic indicators are vital to assess the effectiveness of interventions and make necessary adjustments.The wealth distribution analysis from the 2021 NPHC underscores the critical need for strategic and equitable economic policies in Nepal. We can reduce regional disparities and foster inclusive growth only by focusing on targeted interventions for the most impoverished regions and ensuring a balanced national development strategy.  \nNepali political parties of the Left, Right and Centre never tire of speaking about democracy. Their concern is often about democracy being in some kind of danger, although it is mostly a case of false flagging. But there is one kind of democracy they rarely talk about—the intra-party sort. Practising internal democracy seems much more difficult than seeking it elsewhere. A couple of party conventions in the past few months have highlighted the lack of internal democracy among Nepali political parties. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), which concluded its three-day ‘unity general convention’ on June 12, elected Upendra Yadav as chairperson. Although the party announced its central committee members and central executive committee members after a month of the convention, it has failed to pick office bearers. Likewise, the CPN (Unified Socialist), which completed its six-day ‘national convention’ on July 5, elected Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, and Ghanashyam Bhusal as chairman, senior leader, and general secretary, respectively, through consensus among the party’s top leaders. However, the party has yet to name its 206 central committee members and 18 office bearers.Once Yadav of the JSP-Nepal was elected to the chair unopposed, he halted the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13. Twenty-three candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons, and six were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—had filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary. Similarly, the Unified Socialist has yet to appoint 206 of 299 central committee members and 18 of 21 committee members in addition to finalising standing committee and politburo members. Party insiders say the top brass was busy scrutinising the backgrounds of the aspirants before making a final selection. But scrutinising may mean picking ‘yes’ men and women, especially considering the volatile nature of these parties which are either splinters from a big party or have seen their colleagues break away to form other parties.Apart from these rather fringe parties in Parliament, those that are more mainstream also struggle with the question of internal democracy. The Rastriya Swatantra Party’s joint meeting of central committee and parliamentary party set the tone for the party’s cult culture, with Rabi Lamichhane picking officer bearers considered close to him. There have also been controversies regarding an alleged manipulation of the proportional representation list to include near and dear ones of the party top brass.The situation in the top three parties—Nepali Congress, CPN (UML) and Maoist Centre—is no better. The Congress reflects a perennial vertical division of the Deuba and Koirala camps; the UML is increasingly being consolidated around the “father” figure of KP Sharma Oli, and the Maoists remain as enamoured as ever by the authoritative personality of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. With individual preferences rather than democratic values ruling the roost, the parties sustain on a feudal system offering handouts, or “tika” in the local parlance, to the sycophants while pushing away those who work hard and question the top brass. If there is one sphere that has seen a thriving “Afno Manchhe” culture—which anthropologist Dor Bahadur Bista so eloquently critiqued in his book Fatalism and Development—it is the political parties of Nepal today.  \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump plans a campaign rally on Saturday in Minnesota as he tries to recapture momentum after Vice President Kamala Harris' whirlwind week that saw her emerge as his new Democratic opponent.Trump's event with vice presidential running mate Senator JD Vance brings him to a Midwestern state that has not chosen a Republican presidential candidate in 52 years, as the former president seeks to press into territory that became friendlier in the last few months before President Joe Biden, 81, dropped his reelection bid.Harris, the first Black woman and first Asian American to serve as vice president, swiftly consolidated Democratic support after Biden tapped her to succeed him on Sunday, and a handful of public opinion polls show her appearing to have made up some of the ground Biden lost after a disastrous debate performance.Trump's campaign event in St. Cloud, Minnesota, will take place in an 8,000-seat hockey arena, an indoor venue that complies with the U.S. Secret Service's recommendation that he avoid large outdoor events following the attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally two weeks ago.No Republican presidential candidate has won Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972.Harris, 59, will attend a private fundraiser on Saturday after a series of campaign stops this week in which she laid out the themes that will animate her campaign. She sought to contrast her background as a prosecutor with Trump's record as a convicted felon and argued that her campaign is about looking to the future, while Trump's wants to take the country into the past.Her ascension to the top of the ticket has reenergized a campaign that had faltered badly amid Democrats doubts about Biden's chances of defeating Trump, 78, or his ability to continue to govern should he succeed. She raised more than $100 million in the 36 hours after Biden's departure, according to her campaign.Trump and Vance, 39, have attempted to tie Harris to what they say is the Biden administration's failure to corral high inflation and stem a surge of migrants at the southern border with Mexico. Republicans have also portrayed Harris as more liberal and extreme than Biden.Earlier on Saturday, Trump is set to speak at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, part of a broader Republican effort to court crypto holders ahead of the Nov. 5 election. The party has promised lighter regulation for crypto, while Trump recently slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector.The former president indicated he would like to see expanded bitcoin mining by U.S. firms, even though he called bitcoin a \"scam\" in 2021.\"It's not a shift in the Republican Party as much as it is a revolution,\" Republican Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee told Reuters this week at the conference.Trump will host a fundraiser in Nashville prior to his remarks at the conference, with tickets ranging from $60,000 to over $800,000 per person. Donors can contribute via digital currency as well, according to an event invitation. \nA protest following the death of 17-year-old Nasib Chaudhary of Kanchanpur Belauri-2 turned violent as relatives hurled stones at Dhangadhi-based Nova Hospital on Saturday.Police deployed nine rounds of tear gas shells to quell the unrest after relatives accused the hospital administration of negligence in Nasib's treatment leading to his death.He was initially admitted to Nova Hospital on July 22 for treatment and was diagnosed with jaundice. However, later the hospital had urged the relatives to transfer him to a well-equipped hospital in Nepalgunj or India. Chaudhary passed away en route to Nepalgunj at around 3.30 pm on Friday. The relatives of the deceased accused the hospital administration of not informing them about the deteriorating condition of the patient in time. They also accused the hospital of delaying in releasing the patient asking for full payment before his discharge. Ram Krishna Chaudhary, the maternal uncle of the teenager, claimed that Nasib would not have died had he been allowed to be transferred to other hospitals on time.“First they did not allow us to take the patient to another hospital asking us to clear the dues, when they let us it was too late,” he said.The deceased's relatives have refused to claim his body, demanding accountability from the hospital staff and compensation for the loss. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be Partly to generally cloudy on Saturday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of the country with chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places in the Bagmati and Sudur Pashchim Province.Tonight the weather is expected to be generally cloudy throughout the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province as well as a few places in the rest of the country.The meteorological forecasting division has warned of chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places in the Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province and Sudur Pashchim Province.The maximum temperature on Thursday was recorded at 38 degrees Celsius in Janakpur, while the lowest recorded temperature was 16 degrees Celsius in Jomsom. \nVajra Books and Publications has published the English translation and scientific analysis of the Muluki Ain, first drafted by Janga Bahadur Rana in 1854. This text, a major milestone for the archiving of Nepali historical documents, was translated by Rajan Khatiwoda, Simon Cubelic, and Axel Michaels, a team created in collaboration with Heidelberg University.The first Muluki Ain was considered an important document not only in Nepali but also in South Asian history. It was created to replace sporadic regional law systems of various parts of the country and unify them through a single legal system. Although the text is traditionally accredited to Janga Bahadur Rana, a fact our authors also acknowledge in this translation piece, it was most possibly drafted by a council of prominent lawmakers.The team behind this translated piece is especially dedicated to South Asian legal history. Khatiwoda completed his PhD on the Homicidal Law of 19th-century Nepal, based on various versions of the Muluki Ain. Cubelic, with his PhD in Hindu Legal Scriptures (Dharmashastra), and Michaels, a senior professor at Heidelberg University focusing on South Asian text culture and language, are also experts in this field.The translation brings the various legislatures of 19th-century Nepal to the eye of a larger readership. Some highlights of the Muluki Ain are its highlighting of laws around caste and family systems, purity and sexuality, and punishment systems. These punishment systems also include penalties for acts ranging from stealing, murder and other crimes, to smaller grievances, like punishments for spitting and farting. The text acts as a time capsule for enthusiasts of early Rana history.The authors believe that their text was primarily created to make Nepal’s first written law more accessible to scholars, local and Global, especially those interested in the legal and political systems of South Asia. Khatiwoda adds, “We believe that the book will assist scholars, researchers, and those with interest in related materials to comprehend the immediate social, economic, and political environment of South Asia and Nepal.”Although initially published by Heidelberg University, Vajra Publications has now released the book to make it easily accessible to Nepalese and South Asian audiences. \n'Love and Rain' by Carmela Circelli explores entangled relationships, human fragility, love, beauty, and resilience amidst themes of history, betrayal, and political resistance.\nIn Nepal's corruption-ridden aviation industry, a seventh fatal crash occurred on January 15, 2023, raising concerns over safety and the lack of separation between regulatory and operational functions within the Civil Aviation Authority.\nSeven Nepali athletes will compete in seven events at the 2024 Paris Olympics with the ambitious goal of winning the country's first official medal, including debuts in badminton and table tennis and a return to the women's marathon.\nNepal's new Cabinet under PM Oli has just two women out of 22 members, marking a significant regression from the previous term's 20% representation, raising concerns about gender equality and social inclusion in the country.\nBudget cuts threaten family planning services, potentially leading to increased unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and maternal/child mortality rates amid declining population growth.\nJSP-Nepal and CPN (Unified Socialist) held unity/national conventions, electing leaders but delaying the completion of their convention processes, including the appointment of central committee members, office bearers, and other committee positions.\nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\n\nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has once again defended Deputy Speaker Indira Rana, who has landed in a controversy over requesting in writing the US Embassy for visa interview dates.The party has accused the ruling parties of trying to scandalise the “trivial” issue with a malafide intention to unseat her.A central committee meeting of the RSP on Thursday concluded that the coalition of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress, which is in minority in the Constitutional Council, wanted to remove Rana and get a lawmaker from their parties to replace her. Besides the roles in the legislature, the Deputy Speaker is also a member of the Council that elects chiefs and members of constitutional bodies and the chief justice.The chief justice, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly chair, the leader of the main opposition in the House and the Deputy Speaker are members of the Constitutional Council, which is headed by the prime minister. The UML, which now leads the coalition government involving the Congress and some fringe parties, has two seats in the Constitutional Council. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and House Speaker Devraj Ghimire are from the second-largest party. (Though a Speaker resigns from all party positions after being appointed to lead the House, s/he hardly is aloof from their party in practice as they mostly rejoin it after the completion of the tenure). The CPN (Maoist Centre) is as strong as the UML in the council. Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as the leader of the opposition, and National Assembly chair Narayan Prasad Dahal are members of the Council.If Deputy Speaker Rana resigns, then the ruling coalition can appoint a lawmaker from one of its components in her position and secure a majority in the Council, even if the chief justice stays neutral in constitutional appointments, RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha said. That the ruling parties had blown the issue out of proportion 18 months after the letter addressed to the embassy made it clear that it was politically motivated, he claimed. Deputy Speaker Rana on February 26 last year wrote a letter to the US Embassy, requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. She faces pressure to quit, after the letter was leaked recently.She requested the embassy to arrange interview dates for six people, including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar, and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter. Rana had written that she wanted the interview dates to be preponed as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, scheduled to be held in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023. Experts and retired parliamentary officials criticised her for corresponding with diplomatic agencies without informing the Parliament Secretariat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.After the central committee meeting on Thursday, RSP officials tried to downplay the issue saying that their inquiry had found that the letter hadn’t been registered at the US Embassy in Kathmandu.“The letter has not been registered at the embassy. Nor do we have the evidence of any financial dealings,” said Jha.On July 21, RSP lawmaker Sumana Shrestha, defending Rana in Parliament, said that a media trial was underway to assassinate the character of the Deputy Speaker. Shrestha had said they were ready to leave the post if the ruling parties asked for it. “If you need a seat on the Constitutional Council, ask for it. But a woman’s character should not be assassinated in this manner,” Shrestha had said. After the central committee meeting on Thursday, Jha said allegations against Deputy Speaker Rana were discussed in the central committee.“We challenge the other parties to prove that the letter was registered at the Embassy,” Jha told the Post. “During our informal investigation, we found that no recommendation letter by Rana was registered at the US Embassy.” He added that the letter was dated 18 months ago, and no one was found to have taken any benefits from the recommendation. Her intentions were not wrong, Jha said.Since the deputy Speaker is no longer a member of the party, RSP was not in a position to make any organisational decision related to her, he added.“Complaints against her have been filed to the Parliament Secretariat and the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the legislature. Our party will form an opinion if needed based on the decision they make.” The party meeting also reached a decision to form a panel under the discipline committee to review all allegations the party faces. The meeting decided to form an 11-member statute amendment recommendation committee led by acting RSP General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti. \nThe ruling and opposition parties have started a blame game over Deputy Speaker Indira Rana's move to write a letter to the American Embassy in Kathmandu to allocate convenient visa interview dates for individuals without clear statuses.While some ruling party lawmakers demanded a probe into the matter, opposition lawmakers including those from the Rastriya Swatantra Party said it was a non issue.During the special time in the House of Representatives on Sunday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada demanded a committee to probe the correspondence by Rana.\"A letter requesting dates for US visas has been received. Can the Deputy Speaker still command Parliament?\" he asked. \"There is the Parliament Secretariat to facilitate the visa process if anyone of Parliament has to travel abroad. The Deputy Speaker has breached the norm by writing the letter herself.\"He claimed Rana's move had brought shame not just to Parliament but the whole country. \"The Deputy Speaker's Office cannot act as a consultancy to facilitate the visa process,\" he said.On February 26, 2023 she had written to the consular general at the Embassy of the United States in Kathmandu to arrange interview dates for six people including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter.Rana wrote that as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York on March 6 to 17, 2023, she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. She is now being criticised for misusing her position to make undiplomatic requests.Deputy Speaker, a constitutional position, is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council that recommends chiefs and members of constitutional bodies and the chief justice.Opposition lawmakers, however, claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. Sumana Shrestha, a Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) lawmaker, said Rana's character was being assassinated because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. The council has two members each from the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), one from the RSP and the next is the chief justice.\"Ask for [Rana's] support, we can give. But can you ruin the character of someone by calling them a human trafficker [because the ruling alliance is in a minority]?\" she asked. \"Character assisination is unacceptable. Let us check how everyone has used their letterheads in the past.”She said there must be the criteria for using the letter. She accused the major parties of resorting to a media trial of the deputy Speaker.Stating that the world knows how a lawmaker behaved in Parliament and on the streets demanding visa for an individual, she said the current criticism was nothing but a planned move against Rana. Gyan Bahadur Shahi, a Rastriya Prajatantra Party lawmaker, had led a mass protest against the US Embassy for denying visa to cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane.Though there can be moral questions for writing the letter, Madhav Sapkota, a CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker, said, the way the letter was brought to the public domain now gives enough room to suspect the motive.\"We condemn the move if it is being done with an aim to bulldoze decisions from the Constitutional Council,\" he said. \"As an opposition party, we will strongly oppose such moves.\" Rana also claims that there have been coordinated attempts to attack her. Issuing a statement on Friday, she said, “The attempt to scandalise the letter I wrote out of compassion, after a year and a half, is nothing but a move orchestrated against me,” reads the letter.“Those who know me well are aware of my nature. I may have many personal shortcomings, and there may be many who try to take advantage of that, but I have never engaged in unethical actions, nor will I ever do.\" Experts in the field say the issue is not as light as Rana is trying to portray.Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, said the deputy Speaker must be held accountable for her act.It would be hasty to conclude that writing the letter was an act of human trafficking, Thapa told the Post. “But it is clearly a misuse of authority.\"Rana must take responsibility for her wrongdoings, he said. Writing for herself was not a problem but including the names of those who are not related to Parliament in any way is problematic, Thapa argued.An official at the secretariat claimed that Rana had tried to get the secretariat to write the letter. That didn't happen as then-general secretary Bharat Raj Gautam didn't agree to it, said the official. \"She wrote the letter herself as the general secretary refused to involve the parliament secretariat in it.\" \nThe constitutional bench of the Supreme Court will hear a writ petition challenging the appointment of CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli as prime minister.A single bench of Justice Bal Krishna Dhakal on Sunday forwarded the case to the constitutional bench, citing the need for a ‘serious constitutional interpretation’.“The matter raised in the writ petition involves serious questions of constitutional interpretation, and its resolution should be done by the constitutional bench. Therefore, present it before the chief justice,” the order states.Advocates Deepak Adhikari, Khagendra Prasad Chapagain and Shailendra Kumar Gupta filed the petition on July 15, seeking a mandamus order to annul the appointment arguing that it was unconstitutional.The petitioners argue that the President should initiate the new government formation under Article 76(3) if a government formed under Article 76(2) fails to secure a vote of confidence.Article 76(2) states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the House, the President appoints as prime minister “a member of the House who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties.”Article 76(3) allows the President to appoint the parliamentary party leader of the largest party as prime minister, subjecting him to a vote of confidence within 30 days. Under the clause, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba would become prime minister as the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House.The Office of the President, the Federal Parliament Secretariat, Nepali Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli, among others, have been named defendants in the petition.President Ramchandra Paudel on July 15 appointed Oli as the prime minister after he staked his claim to the post with the support of 166 lawmakers.The President had made a call as per Article 76(2) of the constitution after Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was appointed under the same article, failed the floor test. \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party has defended Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar, who has landed in controversy after a letter she wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting for dates for visa interviews was leaked in the media. The party has described allegations against her as attempts to tarnish the party’s image by dragging it in a controversy.On Sunday, Manish Jha, RSP’s acting spokesperson, issued a statement expressing the party’s concern over news reports mentioning the Deputy Speaker.The statement noted that the matter, “which was already known to the Federal Parliament Secretariat and other high-ranking officials,” has been unnecessarily publicised.“We want to assure everyone that RSP will remain steadfast in its commitment to promoting good governance, social justice, and rapid economic development for Nepal, undeterred by false attacks aimed at tarnishing the party’s image with malicious intent,” Jha said in the statement.The Deputy Speaker has become embroiled in controversy after a letter she wrote to the US Embassy on February 26, 2023, requesting visa interviews for herself and five others was leaked. She had written to the consular general at the Embassy of the United States in Kathmandu to arrange interview dates for six people including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter.Rana wrote that as they were attending the 67th session of Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York on March 6 to 17, 2023, she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. She is now being criticised for misusing her position to make undiplomatic requests to the individuals not even related to parliament secretariat. Deputy Speaker is also ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council that recommends heads and members of constitutional bodies and chief justice.Experts and retired parliamentary officials have criticised her also for corresponding with diplomatic agencies without informing the parliament secretariat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Jha’s statement said the party conducted an immediate inquiry after receiving information on the matter.“It was found that the individuals did not leave the country and there is no evidence of any financial transactions,” the statement read.The statement however has added that RSP supports an impartial investigation by the authorised agencies to determine whether the Deputy Speaker and other leaders breached diplomatic protocols.The RSP has also alleged that the controversy surrounding the Deputy Speaker is a conspiracy hatched by the new ruling coalition.  \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nKathmandu Metropolitan City continues mosquito breeding ground destruction drive to control dengue spread, with 1,268 cases reported since January 2023.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City trained doctors and paramedics in mental health screening to provide timely treatment for prevalent mental health issues in the city, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.\nDespite initial skepticism, Kathmandu's independent mayor and party-affiliated deputy mayor have maintained cordial relations, highlighted by the deputy mayor's recent criticism of the mayor's controversial remarks and his \"lone-wolf\" leadership style.\nMG Motor India is introducing an array of five new vehicles, including electric and hybrid models, in collaboration with JSW Group, with the MG Cloud EV electric MPV expected to debut in the festive season.\nNICCI met with Nepal's Energy Minister to discuss attracting foreign investment, project development, and capacity enhancement in the energy sector, focusing on export opportunities through Indian transmission lines and addressing project completion challenges.\nNepal's ten industrial districts face challenges of infrastructure, regulation, and political instability, impeding private sector growth and foreign investment, despite government efforts to establish new industrial areas.\nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has alerted all agencies concerned to the risk of a Nipah virus outbreak in Nepal, as neighbouring India recently reported a death from the deadly disease.Officials said they have purchased reagents to test the virus and laboratory technicians have been trained to test samples of suspected cases.“We are aware of the Nipah virus outbreak in India and the deaths,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, chief of the Zoonotic and Other Communicable Disease Control Section. “We are closely monitoring the development and have alerted our relevant agencies to the looming risk.”India has reported an outbreak of the Nipah virus in the state of Kerala and the death of a 14-year-old boy from the infection on Sunday. An additional 60 people who came in close contact with the deceased have been identified as a high-risk group by local health authorities, according to media reports.This is the fifth outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala since 2018, according to media reports. Last year too, health authorities in India confirmed at least two deaths and three other cases of the viral infection, including a child, in the southern Indian state.Nipah is a zoonotic virus, transmitted from animals to humans, and causes a lethal swelling of the brain in humans. Transmission generally occurs when people come in close contact with infected animals or through the consumption of the meat of infected animals, according to doctors. The World Health Organisation has classified the Nipah virus as a priority pathogen due to its potential to trigger an epidemic.Transmission generally occurs when people come in direct contact with infected animals—pigs, fruit bats or through consumption of contaminated foods and meat of infected animals, according to health officials. Doctors say cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus have also been reported in many places, including in India, among the families and caregivers of the infected people.Health officials said no treatment for the Nipah virus is available. Without a vaccine having been developed, health workers provide symptomatic treatments only. “We have alerted all our sentinel sites across the country to the risks,” said Ojha. “Health workers are requested to send samples of the suspects for lab testing.”Doctors say Nepal is at risk of an outbreak of the Nipah virus, as fruit bats, which are the primary hosts of the virus, might also be present there. The Nipah virus was first detected in 1999 after farmers and others who came in close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore developed severe respiratory problems and inflammation in the brain.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 300 people were diagnosed with the disease then, and more than 100 of them died.Experts said that authorities should take the issue seriously as the virus is far deadlier than the coronavirus, with up to 75 percent death rate in humans. “The virus is much more infectious and deadlier than other respiratory viruses currently in circulation,” Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, told the Post. “Even if the primary hosts of the virus are fruit bats and pigs, this virus is transmitted from human to human through secretion and excretion. The authorities must step up surveillance.”Doctors say that fruit bats from India, which carry the Nipah virus, can easily enter Nepal due to the proximity and similar environments. Moreover, due to the free movement of people between the two countries, there is always a high chance of any disease seen in India entering Nepal.The incubation period of Nipah infection is 4 to 14 days, and its symptoms include fever, headache, convulsions, and respiratory and neurological problems.The World Health Organisation said that although the virus has caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals and causes severe disease and death in people, making it a public health concern. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population on Tuesday confirmed a cholera outbreak in Thaiba of Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district. A patient with severe diarrhoea tested positive for cholera, officials said.“A lab report confirmed cholera in a diarrhoea patient,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesperson of the Health Ministry. “Stool samples of other diarrheal patients have also been collected for testing.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Officials at the Health Office, Lalitpur told the Post that several people have been infected in a suspected cholera outbreak in the “Drug-Free Society”, a Thaiba-based drug rehab centre. Rapid diagnostic tests confirmed that at least four residents have cholera.“Out of six samples tested, four came positive for cholera,” an official at the municipality told the Post on condition of anonymity. “One patient, in serious condition with severe diarrhoea, has been admitted to the intensive care unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital.”All four infected people were referred to Sukraraj hospital on Monday by the local health authority. But three of them fled the hospital on Monday night, according to Health Ministry officials. “Three patients, who tested positive in rapid diagnostic tests, escaped through the window of the hospital’s toilet on Monday night,” said spokesperson Budhathoky. “Another patient, whose condition is serious, is being treated in intensive care at the hospital. The patient, who tested positive for cholera, has been admitted to a cabin in the hospital.” Officials said that patients might have fled the hospital to avoid returning to the rehab.Following news of the suspected cholera outbreak, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, the agency responsible for responding to the disease outbreaks, mobilised a team of health workers to the rehab.“Samples of water and stools have been collected from the rehab centre,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. The Kathmandu Valley often witnesses cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season, with hundreds of people suffering from diarrheal infections that continue for months.In May, a 62-year-old man from Makawanpur district, who had been hospitalised with severe diarrhoea, tested positive for the deadly disease. The man is said to have been living in Kathmandu for a long time.In 2022, a total of 77 cases of cholera were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Experts say that a cholera outbreak in the Valley during the monsoon is particularly concerning. Rainwater contaminates most water sources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected with water-borne diseases, including cholera. Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main drivers of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. According to the World Health Organisation, a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.A combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nIn a bid to determine the serotypes of the dengue virus from past and current infections, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has been preparing national guidelines.Officials hope that the new guidelines will require relevant agencies to regularly serotype the deadly virus. Serotypes mean different versions of a virus that can be identified by differences in their proteins.“We have been carrying out serotyping of dengue virus on an ad hoc basis,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We can expect serotyping of dengue virus on a regular basis once new guidelines are enforced.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the division, at least 1,657 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 196, followed by Jhapa with 128, Chitwan with 92, Makawanpur with 73, Okhaldhunga with 57, Tanahun with 56, Bhojpur with 52, and Doti 50 cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. There are five serotypes of dengue, numbered 1 through 5.Nepal has reported four serotypes of dengue virus—DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4. Last year, virus serotypes DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 were found responsible for the dengue epidemic in the country. At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Entomologists say that regular serotyping of the dengue virus is important. Pathological investigation of the deadly virus helps differentiate the serotypes of past and current infections, which will ultimately help make people aware of the risks.“People who were infected with one serotype of the dengue virus will not get infected from the same serotype immediately,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “But the risk of severity will be high if he/she is infected with different serotypes. Concerned authorities can tell the people about the serotypes spreading in their communities.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. They say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe Indian links of some US presidential election contenders probably mean little additional benefit for ties, experts said, against the backdrop of bipartisan support for closer relations with the South Asian nation to counter an assertive China.Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Usha Chilukuri Vance, the wife of Republican Donald Trump’s running-mate, have rarely visited the birthplace of one or both of their parents, although Indians take pride in their success.“Either way, from India’s perspective, whether it is Republican or Democrat, that relationship enjoys bipartisan support and should not be affected,” said Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a former Indian ambassador to the United States.“It can only benefit,” he said of the India links, adding, “(It) cannot be affected adversely.”Since ties with New Delhi are viewed favourably by both parties in Washington, there will be little impact on relations, regardless of which party wins, or the candidate’s Indian roots, an Indian government official said on condition of anonymity.Both President Joe Biden and Trump, his predecessor in office, sought to woo India, not just to challenge China in the region, but also to wean New Delhi from a traditional dependence on Russian weapons.Role modelBoth Harris and Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential candidate, J.D. Vance have links to southern India. Vance belongs to a family of renowned academics.Harris, who has garnered the backing of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination, is viewed as role model in her mother’s ancestral village of Thulasendrapuram.She has “proven how young women, previously confined to their homes, can reach such heights, becoming a public figure in the world’s No. 1 country,” said J Sudhakar, a resident of the village where Harris’ maternal grandfather was born.“How big an achievement is that?”Harris, who visited the village as a five-year-old, has recalled walks with her grandfather on the beach of the city of Chennai where the family later lived, about 320 km (200 miles) from the village of roughly 2,000 people.But she has not been back since becoming US vice president.“Residents expected a visit, a statement or at least a mention of the village, but that didn’t happen,” said shopkeeper G. Manikandan.“But we will invite her when she wins and organise a grand celebration and welcome for her,” he added. \nSaboteurs struck France’s TGV high-speed train network in a series of pre-dawn attacks that caused chaos on the country’s busiest rail lines ahead of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony on Friday.The coordinated sabotage took place as France rolled out an unprecedented peacetime security operation involving tens of thousands of police and soldiers to lockdown the capital for the Games, sucking in security resources from across the country.The state-owned railway operator said vandals had damaged signal boxes along the lines connecting Paris with cities such as Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Strasbourg in the east. Another attack on the Paris-Marseille line was foiled.Hundreds of thousands of people were left stranded at rail stations.There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But two security sources said initial suspicions fell on hardline leftist militants or environmental activists.“Everything leads us to believe that these were criminal acts,” Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete told reporters at the Gare du Nord.The coordinated strikes on the rail network will feed into a sense of apprehension ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony in the heart of Paris later on Friday.More than 300,000 spectators are expected to line the banks of the River Seine when the athletes parade through the heart of Paris on a flotilla of barges and riverboats, part of an extravagant opening ceremony that will be watched by a global audience of billions.The SNCF urged all travellers to postpone their journeys. Repairs were underway but traffic would be severely disrupted until at least the end of the weekend. Trains were being sent back to their points of departure.The attacks hit signalling installations on the Atlantic, Northern and Eastern high-speed lines with fires set off by explosive devices, the SNCF said.SNCF chief Jean-Pierre Farandou said some 800,000 customers had been impacted ahead of a busy weekend for French holidaymakers. Thousands of rail staff had been deployed to repair the damage.DESTABILISING FRANCE“This attack is not a coincidence, it’s an effort to destabilise France,” Valerie Pecresse, president of the Paris region, told reporters.France is deploying 45,000 police, 10,000 soldiers and 2,000 private security agents to secure the opening ceremony. Snipers will be on rooftops and drones keeping watch from the air.But while the capital is locked down for the opening ceremony, security elsewhere in the country is lighter.Paris 2024 said it was working closely with the SNCF to assess the situation. The attacks will make it tougher for people travelling to Paris from other areas of France.Some teams like the U.S. basketball team are based in Paris and would have travelled on Saturday by train to the northern city of Lille.The Paris police chief said he was beefing up security even further at the capital’s main stations.The stations were packed with passengers. Many were preparing to go off on their summer holidays and some had already been waiting several hours.At the Gare de L’Est, traveller Corinne Lecocq said her train to Strasbourg on the border with Germany had been cancelled.“We’ll take the slow line,” she said. “I’m on holiday so it’s OK, even if it is irritating to be late.”Xavier Hiegel, 39, said he was just trying to get home for the weekend and could not believe that people would want to harm the Olympics.“The Games bring jobs so this really is nonsense. I hope the people responsible will be found and punished,” he said. \nMexican drug lord Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and the son of his former partner, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, were arrested on Thursday in El Paso, Texas, in a major coup for US authorities that may also reshape the Mexican criminal landscape.Zambada is one of the most consequential traffickers in Mexico’s history and co-founded the Sinaloa Cartel with El Chapo, who was extradited to the United States in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison.Both Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of El Chapo, face multiple charges in the US for funnelling huge quantities of drugs to US streets, including fentanyl, which has surged to become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45.Zambada, who is believed to be in his 70s, and Guzman Lopez, who is in his 30s, were detained after landing in a private plane in El Paso, two US officials told Reuters.Guzman Lopez is one of four sons of El Chapo known as Los Chapitos, or Little Chapos, who inherited their father’s faction of the Sinaloa Cartel. His brother, Ovidio Guzman, was arrested last year and extradited to the United States.In recent years, the Sinaloa Cartel has become the biggest target for US authorities, who have accused the crime syndicate of being the biggest supplier of fentanyl to the United States.Zambada and Guzman Lopez face multiple charges in the US “for heading the Cartel’s criminal operations, including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.The arrest of Guzman Lopez was first reported by Reuters, ahead of the Justice Department statement where it was confirmed they were detained in El Paso.The US authorities had a $15 million reward for Zambada’s capture, while Guzman Lopez had a $5 million bounty on his head.The Sinaloa cartel traffics drugs to more than 50 countries around the globe and is one of the two most powerful organized crime groups in Mexico, according to US authorities.Zambada and El Chapo’s sons belong to two different generations of traffickers, with differing styles.Zambada is known for being an “old-school” narco, avoiding the limelight and operating in the shadows. El Chapo’s sons, by contrast, have a reputation for being flashy narcos who courted attention as they ascended the rank of the cartel.El Chapo’s sons are also known to be more violent and hot-headed than Zambada, who had a reputation as a shrewd operator.Zambada and El Chapo’s sons have had a fractious relationship since their father was extradited in 2017, and the arrests of Zambada and Guzman Lopez may trigger instability or even violence in their heartlands in the northern state of Sinaloa.Their arrests were part of a joint operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agencies, two US officials said.US authorities have over the past year launched fresh indictments against Zambada and Guzman’s sons on new charges in the United States that focus on fentanyl smuggling, as well as the flow of precursor chemicals to the illicit labs operated by their crime syndicate.Over decades, the cartel has set up sophisticated supply chains to move drugs across the globe and to source heavily regulated chemicals to their home base in Sinaloa.Earlier in the day on Thursday, Reuters published an investigation that revealed how fentanyl precursor chemicals are astonishingly easy and cheap to buy online from Chinese sellers that ship the substances door-to-door in North America.“Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable,” Garland added. \nPresident Joe Biden said on Wednesday he had pulled out of the race against Republican Donald Trump because of his concerns about the future of the country, his first public remarks since his abrupt departure from the 2024 campaign.In an Oval Office address, Biden invoked previous presidents Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln as he described his love for the office that he will leave in six months, capping a half century in public office.“I revere this office,” Biden said. “But I love my country more.”Biden, 81, rebuffed weeks of pressure from Democrats to step aside after a disastrous debate performance on June 27, saying at one point that only the “Lord Almighty” could convince him to go. He spent days soul-searching and agonizing over internal polling that showed he could lose to Trump in November and drag down fellow Democrats with him before stepping aside.“I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,” Biden said.Biden sprinkled his 11-minute speech with references to the danger he believes Americans face if Trump wins the November 5 election, without mentioning Trump’s name.He said he was departing from the race to help heal the wounds in the Democratic Party and unite Democrats in the goal of winning.“Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition,” he said.“The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America – lies in your hands,” Biden said.It was Biden’s first extended public remarks since he relented to pressure from fellow Democrats and announced on Sunday via social media that he had decided not to seek reelection on November 5.Out of camera sight during the speech were several members of Biden’s close-knit family, and senior advisers, seated along the curved Oval Office wall. They erupted into applause when Biden completed his remarks.Toward the end of his remarks, Ashley Biden reached for the hand of her mother, first lady Jill Biden, who was seated next to her.Biden is the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since 1968 when Lyndon Johnson, under fire for his handling of the Vietnam War, abruptly pulled out of the campaign on March 31.Biden also joins James K Polk, James Buchanan, Rutherford B. Hayes, Calvin Coolidge and Harry Truman as presidents who all decided not to stand for a second elected term.Biden faced immediate calls to step aside after his rocky performance in the debate against Trump raised troubling questions about his mental acuity.Since he stepped aside, however, Democrats have rallied around him, paying tribute to his character and his record as president.“Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter, from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,” Biden said. “But here I am.”A crowd of staff members walked into the White House earlier in the evening to watch the speech together. Huge cheers and applause came from those who assembled in the White House Rose Garden to hear Biden speak after his address. Ice cream was servedThe White House has denied that Biden has any cognitive issues despite a recent increase in verbal slip-ups.Biden said he will focus on his job as president over his remaining six months in office. He pledged to help make NATO stronger and more united, stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from taking over Ukraine, work toward a ceasefire deal in Gaza and push for Supreme Court reform. He is to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to discuss efforts to negotiate a Gaza ceasefire.It was the fourth time Biden used the formal setting of the Oval Office since taking office in 2021. His last Oval Office speech was on July 15 when he urged Americans to cool the political rhetoric after the attempted assassination of Trump.Biden’s political career began when he was elected to the Senate in 1972 at age 29, becoming the sixth youngest US senator. He will conclude his White House tenure on January 20, 2025, as the oldest American president when he will have already turned 82.“The defense of democracy is more important than any title,” Biden said. “I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It’s about you. Your families. Your futures. It’s about ‘We the People.’” \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \n“I am going to attend NGO CSW67 Forum in New York, NY, USA. Which is going to held from 6th March to 17th March 2023 in New York.” Thus began the by-now infamous letter by the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Indira Rana, to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting an early visa interview date. The missive itself was addressed to “The counselor General” at the embassy, seemingly a position that exists at the American embassy here but is unknown anywhere else in the world.I will not rush to condemn Deputy Speaker Rana for what, in one extreme, has even been called a form of human trafficking, not especially having read about her life when she had been elevated to the august office. Perhaps it was only a serious lapse in judgement?For me, the bigger crime was the letter itself. What followed the excerpt above was even more cringeworthy. That got me thinking about an interaction I had in a private chat group some weeks back. A Nepali woman who had reached a somewhat prestigious position in an international organisation had posted the following on social media: “I’m honored to serve another term as a President of XX Family Network with esteemed volunteers worldwide. It was pleasure to welcome Mr. YY, President of XX and the honorary president of XX Family Network...”My off-the-cuff comment in the group was that while it was great Nepalis were reaching high places, it was “just annoying that she could not get simple grammar right. An Indian would never have let that pass”. Unlike Indira Rana, who went to a Nepali-medium school and who could be excused for coming up with such a hash of a letter, the above entry was by someone with a convent-school background. The least she should have been capable of is the proper use of the indefinite and definite articles—“a” and “the”. In just that one fragment of a sentence, there are four grammatical errors, with three having to do with her wrong use or non-use of articles.Some years ago, a desk editor friend at an English newspaper said he spent nearly all his time fixing, as he called it, the “is-are” in the copy handed to him. He was expressing his frustration with stories filed by reporters without any idea about subject-verb agreement, i.e., using the correct verb to match the subject of the sentence. Considering that conjugation of verbs is generally quite simple in English, determined as it is mainly by the subject’s being singular or plural, one wonders why despite decades of English-medium, private school education, the quality of English among Nepalis remains so abysmal.I believe the answer lies in the English-language textbooks students go through in their school life. I mean such books as produced in Nepal. In our times, we had to study books published in India, the same as those used in English schools there and without doubt of a quality that contributes to the facility with which Indians use the language.Things began to change in Nepal in the mid-1980s. Indian publishers were still supplying textbooks to Nepal, albeit with tweaks such as Guided English for India being renamed Guided English for Nepal. But there was a market they could not fulfil. If I am not mistaken, Nepali publishers began their foray into English-language textbooks with social studies after there was a backlash from parents complaining about their children learning the history and geography of India. I was a schoolteacher back then, and I remember how atrocious those books were. Unfortunately, not much has changed. In fact, the situation has become worse, with the textbook market having spawned many new publishers, churning out stuff on all subjects that is almost criminal in content given the errors being drilled into our students.A youngster I know has just entered Class XI to study physical science. Since language proficiency is possible only when used correctly in all contexts, and also out of plain curiosity, I had a look at his books. The following howlers have been taken from the very first paragraphs of the texts he will be reading for the next year. A mathematics book dealing with elementary logic started with this: “Critical and rigorous thinking are necessary for the clear understanding of a subject in all areas. The ideas emerged can be communicated in speech or writing in sentences.” If only the communication had been both grammatically and linguistically correct.And, there was this ostentatious start to a physics book: “The branch of science which deals with the study of natural phenomenon is called physics. To understand physics, we must be able to connect our theoretical description of nature with experimental observations. Such connection is made through quantitative measurements…The process of comparing an unknown physical quantity with a known fixed quantity is called the measurement. The quantity used as a standard of measurement is called the unit.” Apart from the unnecessary use of the definite article in the last two sentences and the absence of the indefinite ones in the preceding ones and at least one other error I could spot, this is written well enough but what a boring read.The same was true for another physics book that began thus: “Just what is Physics? Physics deals with the understanding of natural phenomena. It is a science based on experimental observation. All of the ideas presented in this book were not found in a cave or brought to use by aliens; in fact, they were discovered by real people engaged to find a solution to a problem of life.” One understands where the authors are going but…Given the changed times, the chemistry textbook cited here could easily have used a female as an example (after having corrected the language): “The student who works on the chemistry laboratory should always be realized about the importance of general direction of working in the chemistry laboratory. It is advised that he should always follows these rules with the attention and care they deserve and ultimately they will help him to add to his credit not only in his examination but in his later life as well.”A numerical chemistry book began with numbers and so I went to the preface: “It’s our pleasure to bring this ‘Integrated Numerical Chemistry’ book to you all. This book covers numerical problems that students of 11th and 12th grade need to know so that they can excel in exam…In market it is not difficult to find many other numerical Chemistry books.”Of course, all of these books have been, as some proudly declared, “Approved by Curriculum Development Centre (CDC), Nepal” (with the definite article before “Curriculum Development Centre” invariably missing). And, I have not even started on other aspects of book production that these publishers seem to have no idea about. There were unnecessary indents while indents were missing where required. The spacing between lines was inconsistent. None of the books I went through had used “smart quotes”, those squiggly things that are a pleasure to behold compared to the \"straight ones\". Neither was there any uniformity in the style or size of the font within the same book. The printing and paper used was terrible in some of the books, particularly those produced by the government, rendering page and page quite unreadable.If such is the material being used to educate our children in expensive private schools, I should say, Indira Rana did not do that badly with her letter. After all, as the saying goes: Garbage in, garbage out. \nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Nepal polio-free in 2014 after the country maintained the status for three consecutive years. Nevertheless, a few days back, the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) announced the re-emergence of the poliovirus, prompting preparations for a polio vaccination drive in Kathmandu. Although the virus was found in sewage/river water samples rather than clinical samples, it raises a grave concern regarding public health threats in Nepal. Polio is a highly infectious but vaccine-preventable viral disease primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route. It can also spread through contaminated water and food. Symptoms usually become visible seven to 10 days after exposure but can range from four to 35 days. The maximum excretion of the virus can be observed two to three days before the onset of symptoms and one week after the symptoms appear. There are three poliovirus strains: Wild poliovirus type-1 (WPV-1), wild poliovirus type-2 (WPV-2) and wild poliovirus type-3 (WPV-3). Fever, fatigue, vomiting, headache, stiff neck and limb pain are the initial symptoms which usually last for about a week. Up to 90 percent of infected individuals show mild or no symptoms. A small proportion of cases develop irreversible paralysis, usually of the lower limbs. Of these (paralysed patients), five to 10 percent die due to respiratory failure. Serology tests, cell cultures and polymerase chain reactions (PCR) are laboratory methods to identify the virus. As per available information, samples found in the sewage of Kathmandu were sent to Bangkok for laboratory testing to confirm the virus. The genetic sequencing method can help identify mutations in the virus and their origin. Presently, the source of the poliovirus detected in Nepal remains unknown. No specific anti-viral medicine is available for poliovirus and treatment is mainly supportive. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is widely used worldwide, including in Nepal. It contains live, weakened poliovirus, which replicates in the body of the vaccinated child and spreads to others when the child excretes. If such a weakened virus circulates for an extended period in the community, it can be mutated and cause paralysis in an unvaccinated infected patient. Poliovirus mutated from the original strains (in the OPV) is known as vaccine-derived poliovirus. The OPV contains a combination of up to three strains of live poliovirus. Nepal had switched to bivalent OPV from trivalent OPV on April 17, 2016. The bivalent OPV (bOPV) vaccine contains types 1 and 3 weakened polioviruses, protecting against poliovirus types 1 and 3. The virus currently detected in Kathmandu is said to be vaccine-derived poliovirus type-3, meaning this virus may have escaped from bOPV or circulated for a long time. Interestingly, Israel also reported vaccine-derived poliovirus type-3 in March 2022. However, it is not clear if there is any relationship between Israeli and Nepali polioviruses. Moreover, without genetic sequencing analysis, it is not possible to firmly establish Israel as the country of origin of the Nepali poliovirus.Nepal experienced multiple waves of measles outbreaks in 2023. The reasons behind these unusual outbreaks remain unknown and have not been investigated; the potential explanation could be the interruption of childhood immunisation programmes due to fear of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) transmission (during the pandemic). In fact, I had predicted and warned about the possibility of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in children in the absence of a regular immunisation programme owing to Covid-19 waves. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on poliovirus needs to be explored to understand its shifting clinical nature and genetic coding. There are ample studies published about post-impact of Covid-19 waves on non-communicable diseases, for example, post-Covid syndrome. However, little is known about the immune system and its reaction to infectious diseases following Covid-19 waves.Several countries, such as India (type-1), the UK (type-2), the US (type-2), Indonesia (type-2) and Israel (type-3) have reported circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses during the same year (2022), meaning that these mutated strains of polioviruses emerged in a similar time-period following multiple waves of Covid-19 worldwide. It seems that the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses could happen anywhere and anytime in the days to come. This sparks a grave concern because vaccine-derived poliovirus can also behave like wild-type viruses, cause outbreaks and lead to paralytic presentations in unvaccinated individuals. For instance, Indonesia reported acute flaccid paralysis cases in two patients (a six-year-old female and a one-year-old male) after they were infected with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type-2. Many researchers believe that low vaccination coverage and the weakened virus from OPV spreading among under-immunised populations foster conditions conducive to the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses in the community. At present, the origin of vaccine-derived poliovirus detected in the sewage of Kathmandu is not clear. Vaccine-derived poliovirus type-3 detected (as per media report) in Kathmandu due to the circulating of the weakened virus from OPV among the under-immunised population could be a plausible explanation, as Nepal is currently using a bivalent polio vaccine (bOPV) in its immunisation programme that contained poliovirus type-1 and type-3. As of now, the emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus may not pose a significant health risk for the community. Nonetheless, the persistent detection of these mutated viruses within the community or in outbreak situations can pose significant public health challenges in Nepal and around the world. Thus, maintaining surveillance and adherence to vaccination in children is important to sustain Nepal’s polio eradication status.  \nFederalism, republicanism, secularism, inclusiveness and the rule of law are key pillars of Nepal's constitution. Disrupting even one of these pillars jeopardises the constitution and risks plunging the country into conflict. The provincial level symbolises federalism, but it faces significant criticism. The provincial structure was introduced to address the Madhesh Movement and the Maoist insurgency. However, this change has not been widely accepted, leading to calls for eliminating the provincial structure altogether.The institutionalisation of provinces has been hampered and neglected not only by the federal government but also by leaders from key political parties. The constitution grants exclusive and shared rights to the provinces, requiring the authorities to make laws, form annual budgets and decisions, and formulate and implement policies and plans. The provinces, however, began with no prior experience, leading to a prolonged period of trial and error. This has resulted in unfair criticism and calls for the abolition of provinces. Systemic delaysThe federal government's delay in enacting the Federal Civil Service Law has led to a chaotic personnel administration system in the provinces. While provinces have issued the civil service acts, the federal recognition of promotions remains inconsistent. Federal employees assigned to provinces often rest unmotivated and disconnected from local needs. This undermines provincial governance as these employees are less responsive to provincial authorities. A similar issue exists in the education sector. The School Education Bill in Parliament lacks clear national standards for school education and has bypassed the exclusive right of the local level.The federal government is introducing new bills related to universities, but my concern lies in constitutional grants that give provinces the right to establish provincial universities. While provinces are establishing universities, the federal government is simultaneously introducing its own university bills. When I was a member of Parliament, I argued that the higher education bill and education policy should be prioritised, and only then can universities be established. However, I received no support from my colleagues. Many assert that the provincial structure has become expensive and burdensome. However, provincial expenditures constitute only 10 percent of the total expenditures across federal, provincial and local levels. How can a structure spending merely 10 out of 100 rupees be deemed burdensome?Federal government ministries have withheld and spent budgets meant for the provinces indiscriminately. For instance, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure has a budget of Rs150 billion, while the Ministry of Urban Development has around 100 billion. Some ministries have budgets as high as Rs250 billion. In contrast, the combined budget of all seven provinces for FY 2024-25 is only Rs279 billion. Meanwhile, the ministers of the Physical Infrastructure and Urban Development Ministries together control budgets larger than those of all seven provinces combined. This discrepancy highlights the centralised control over resources that should be allocated to provinces.The matter of sizeThe constitution considers provinces to be the key pillars of development. However, many federal ministries have retained small-scale programmes and projects that should fall under provincial jurisdiction. Despite this, if the provincial structure is considered cumbersome, we can reduce the number of provincial ministers. Similarly, reducing the number of provincial members is also necessary. However, streamlining federal governance and aligning it with the constitutional spirit requires significantly reducing the number of federal ministers. If we follow the constitutional mandate properly, the budget of federal ministries would go to the sub-federal level.The constitution provides state power to provinces (Article 56) but lacks its own staff, police force, adequate financial resources and land acquisition. During budget preparation and execution, provinces often face a shortage of finance secretaries and staff. The annual report of the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) indicates a shortage of 11,000 employees in the provinces. Reports from constitutional commissions, including the OAG, reveal federal government’s non-cooperation with sub-federal levels and interference in policy formulation, budget implementation and personnel management.Provinces have been hindered by political mismanagement, federal centralisation and inadequate intergovernmental relations. To realise the potential of federalism, it is crucial to decentralise authority, improve cooperation, and support provinces in their development journey. Only through these reforms can Nepal's provinces become effective and autonomous entities within the federal system. By addressing the challenges of origin, acceptance, duplication of efforts and fiscal mismanagement, provinces can enhance their effectiveness and contribute to the overall federal system.Reforming the systemSeveral reforms are necessary to empower and strengthen provinces. The federal government must respect constitutional provisions and allow the provinces to manage their police, staff, and other key areas independently. There is a need to organise regular meetings and functional mechanisms for cooperation, coexistence and coordination among federal, provincial and local governments. National standards across all government levels should be developed and enforced to ensure uniformity in services and goods provided.Political leaders' attitudes towards provinces remain unenthusiastic. Chief ministers cannot act independently and need party leaders' consent even for minor decisions. For provinces to function effectively, political parties must align their structures with the provincial system. Provincial committees should be empowered, and accountability systems should be established, linking the federal government to the central committee, the provincial governments to the province committees, and the local government to the district committee. However, considering the international practice of province management and the centralised thinking of Nepal's political parties, these improvements seem unlikely.During Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's tenure, provinces could still not utilise police powers. Chief ministers' voices are often unheard due to provincial instability. They have also been neglected and bypassed in the fiscal transfer system. For instance, in FY 2018-19, provinces received Rs123 billion in grants from the Government of Nepal. Although the budget increased by Rs500 billion over six years, the grant amount to provinces in FY 2024-25 decreased to Rs96 billion—27 billion less than six years ago.Reforms for stability Provinces can effectively lobby the federal government only when they are stable. This requires constitutional amendments through electoral system reforms. Provinces include a mixed electoral system like the federal Parliament, and the proportional electoral system should be abolished in favour of the first-past-the-post system with ensured proportional and inclusive representation. This would require ensuring seats for women, Dalits, tribals, Muslims, and backward classes within the direct election system. This method will decrease the number of provincial assembly members and likely result in one or two parties gaining a majority. Alternatively, a directly elected chief ministerial system, with accountability to the provincial Assembly and requiring a two-thirds majority for removal, can also provide stability.Additionally, reforming the number of provincial ministers is necessary. Limiting ministers to 10 percent of provincial assembly members, with a minimum of five, is a viable option. Most countries, whether at federal or provincial levels, have limited numbers of ministers. For instance, the Swiss constitution mandates just seven federal ministers, including the president. Reducing the number of federal ministries and aligning provincial governance structures with constitutional provisions are crucial steps in strengthening Nepal's federal system and ensuring effective provincial governance. \nNepal, a country that was long in the clutches of poliovirus, made a significant stride when in 2014 the United Nations declared it “polio-free”. However, the recent detection of type-3 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV)—active viruses in the oral polio vaccine—in Kathmandu’s sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers indicates a potential outbreak. Although no one has been infected, the presence of the virus in sewage is in itself concerning. This calls for a prompt response from the authorities, as it could put Nepal’s achievements on polio at risk. According to the World Health Organisation, polio or poliomyelitis mainly affects children under five (but anyone unvaccinated is at risk). It is a water-borne disease and is transmitted through unhygienic habits, droplets or aerosols, faecal contamination, infected utensils, food and water. Infection from the virus has declined (by 99 percent) worldwide since 1988, but the WHO warns that “as long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk”. South Asian countries Pakistan and Afghanistan have also reported wild polio in wastewater in recent months. This means the risk of contagion in Nepal is far from over, and we can no longer be complacent. The emergence of VDPVs, as per the WHO and studies, is associated with low immunisation coverage. Vaccination is thus crucial to contain the spread of polio. Nepal has undertaken many vaccine campaigns against it. Still, as per the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, at least 4 percent of children aged 12-23 months have not been jabbed against any disease. The vaccine coverage rate for polio, according to the Health Ministry, is 95 throughout the country. So, the virus could strike under-vaccinated and unvaccinated children at any time. For successful eradication of the poliovirus back in 2014, the country’s efforts included routine vaccine campaigns, door-to-door calls, additional national and subnational mass vaccination campaigns, surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis, mop-up campaigns, and the introduction of injected vaccines in addition to oral vaccines. It’s time the government and healthcare authorities dusted off their old knowledge and kits. However, studies show that vaccines alone don’t help. A recent article, “Polio in Gaza: What Does This Mean For the Region and the World?” in The Conversation highlights how maintaining sanitation and hygiene can help eradicate polio.Health authorities and donor agencies have arranged special vaccination drives in Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur and are launching the campaign from today, and it will continue till July 27. They must ensure that not a single child is deprived or missed and also focus on virus surveillance in other districts and start jabbing children wherever necessary. Despite this initiative, a recent Post report highlights a significant disparity in the country’s approach to sample collection: They are taken from five tributary rivers in the Kathmandu Valley, Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces; other provinces are excluded. This isn’t comprehensive enough as poliovirus could be detected anywhere, given the constant flow of people, in and out of the country.The situation demands that the government develop country-wide monitoring, vaccination campaigns and sanitation programmes without further ado. If these measures are not prioritised, it could be a matter of time before we have another polio wave on our hands.   \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli secured a resounding majority in the House of Representatives on Sunday. Getting 188 votes in the 275-strong chamber, Oli showed the backing of over two-thirds members of the lower house. This in itself is a positive start to a new stint as prime minister for Oli. A powerful government is in the interest of the country that has been reeling under economic crisis, unemployment and other problems. However, securing an overwhelming House majority at the start of the term is nothing new for a Nepali prime minister. CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who secured over 97 percent votes in the House in January 2023, had to go for the floor test three more times before he was ousted earlier this month. In the fourth vote, he was supported by only 22 percent of the members of the same House.When KP Sharma Oli became prime minister for the second time in February 2018, he returned to Singhadurbar with a strong mandate as the erstwhile left alliance of the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) won a resounding majority in the 2017 general elections. In May the same year, they converted the left alliance into a single unified party making Oli a strong prime minister, commanding an overwhelming majority in the federal parliament. But this unified force fell apart and the two mother parties were revived in March 2021. When the Supreme Court in July 2021 ousted Oli, the UML chair lost not only the trust of other parties but also the support of many lawmakers from his own party. These are just a few instances. If history is any guide, securing a big parliamentary majority at the start means little if cannot be protected for any length of time. The goal should rather be to use this strength for the benefit of the country’s larger good.The country needs a strong government and political stability—more specifically, policy consistency. The government in place in turn urgently needs to address pressing issues—prolonged economic stagnation, slow development activities, unemployment, brain drain, corruption. But the mother of all problems is the protracted economic crisis. So the top priority should be to fix the economy. This done, many other things will fall into place.Prime Minister Oli is praised not only by his party comrades but also the rivals for his bold decision making capacity. But he is also often accused of bulldozing others’ views. This is also why in 2021 he irked many leaders within his party as well as chiefs of other political forces and lost their support. Oli’s statements after becoming prime minister last week suggest a change. The remarks he has made in the House on domestic as well as foreign relations are more balanced this time. The prime minister must not forget that the support of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, has made it possible for him to return to power with a strong parliamentary support. His relations, mainly with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, is going to be crucial. Just as was the case during his previous tenures, Oli’s success this time will depend on whether he can accommodate other viewpoints, both from in and out of the ruling coalition. This, unfortunately, has not always been his strong suit.  \nThe accusations of abuse of authority and accepting kickbacks that have been levelled against Deputy Speaker of the federal parliament Indira Rana Magar are not easy to dismiss. Rana Magar recently came into controversy after a letter she wrote to the American Embassy in Kathmandu, urging the embassy to expedite visa dates for some people, came to light. In the letter dated 26 February 2023, she has asked the consular general at the embassy to arrange visa dates for six people, including herself. The other five are Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung. The communication was made on the official letterhead of the House of Representatives. The letter says the six were attending the 67th session of Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023, and she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. In normal course, the Parliament Secretariat makes such requests on behalf of the speaker and deputy speaker via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. What is even more unusual is that Rana Magar admits that she knew only one of the other five people mentioned in the letter. Some media reports have also published material suggesting that the deputy speaker accepted money in return for lobbying for visa dates. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which nominated her to the state position, has denounced her ‘media trial’ and an attempt at ‘character assassination’. In her own defence, Rana Magar has put out a statement saying that she wrote the letter “out of compassion” for the grassroots folks who would otherwise never get to go abroad. These arguments are difficult to buy. It is inappropriate for a deputy speaker to recommend complete strangers for a programme to which they are not even remotely connected. Another problem is that Rana Magar has been changing her statements. For instance, when the controversy first surfaced, she said she had signed no such letter. Later, she admitted to signing and sending it. Both Rana Magar and the RSP have questioned why the letter, written a year and a half ago, has been made public now. They say it is aimed at removing Rana Magar from the Constitutional Council. (Deputy Speaker is an ex-officio member of the council that recommends chiefs and members of constitutional bodies). Perhaps. Yet the RSP does not have a plausible explanation for why it did nothing even though the letter came to the notice of its top officials at least three months ago.There are a few indubitable facts. One, there is no doubt that Rana Magar wrote that letter. Two, in doing so, she abused her authority. As far as accusations of monetary exchanges are concerned, they are a matter of investigation. Any way you see it, this issue calls for a thorough parliamentary investigation. Someone in Rana Magar’s position does not have the luxury of making such ‘innocent’ mistakes—or even what little prestige that remains of the state’s high offices will quickly vanish. If there was a criminal motive, the implications of a high-ranking state official engaging in human trafficking are worse still. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nIn the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be Partly to generally cloudy on Friday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of Bagmati, Gandaki, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province as well as in a few districts of other Provinces.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal’s private sector has been sailing in troubled waters. The central bank responded to the problem experienced for the past two fiscal years by easing monetary policy and cutting rates to keep credit flowing. For the first time, the bank has admitted that the country suffered an “economic slowdown” for two consecutive years.The private sector welcomed the monetary policy for the fiscal year 2024–25, unveiled by Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari on Friday. The policy aims to ramp up support for the economy, which has been slowing, said Adhikari. “The policy targets gradual economic recovery by controlling inflation, stabilising interest rates, and ensuring credit demand.”The central bank said monetary policy had transitioned to an “easing, cautious” mode to address the demand of the private sector, which is the driver of economic growth.With easing measures, the central bank expects a double-digit private sector credit growth, increasing by 12.5 percent year-on-year in 2024-25.“The monetary policy is favourable for the private sector. It aims at economic recovery through productive use of private-sector credit,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. “There was a problem. Money had piled up in banks, and businesses were not getting it to invest. The policy has untied the knot.”The central bank said the private sector pumped Rs5.27 trillion into the economy in the last fiscal year, which ended on July 15. This accounts for 92 percent of Nepal’s economy.The growth of the construction sector also stalled in the period. In the last fiscal year, the sector, with a contribution of 5.41 percent to the economy, is projected to have dropped to 2.07 percent. To address the sector’s grievances, the monetary policy has extended the interest payment deadline for contractors to November.“It’s welcoming, though it is late,” said Rabi Singh, president of the Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal. “But this is just a temporary arrangement.”“We had recommended the government for recapitalisation of the loans and interest for 2 to 5 years to stabilise the construction industry’s capital structure,” he said.The government defaulted on payment for contractors, forcing hundreds of projects to halt and eventually cause the construction sector, one of the key economic indicators, to enter a recession. “Still, we need the assurance of enough cash flow for the development of the critical infrastructure, which is also the basis for jobs creation.”Singh said the construction sector has been working on projects amounting to Rs600 billion.The central bank said the measures to cut interest rates are intended to enhance market liquidity and support economic activity in a low-inflation environment. The upper ceiling interest rate corridor has been decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 6.5 percent, and the policy rate has been reduced by 0.5 percent, to 5 percent.According to market analysts, if banks’ interest rates are low, people generally tend to invest. This will allow liquidity injections in the market without it being absorbed by the banks and the central bank.The monetary policy stated that the high liquidity in the banking system would support businesses and individuals and ease the difficulties of the private sector.The central bank said mobilising the banks’ liquidity through the private sector would support the federal government’s ambitious economic growth target. “This monetary policy will help us reach the 6 percent economic growth targeted by the federal government by keeping inflation at around 5 percent,” said Governor Adhikari. He said the central bank would manage liquidity and inject capital into the productive sector to achieve the target growth.According to the annual account estimates by the National Statistics Office, Nepal’s economic growth was estimated at 3.87 percent in the last fiscal year, in an optimistic scenario.The World Bank said in its April Nepal Development Update that economic growth is projected to accelerate to 4.6 percent in the current fiscal year, a way below the government target.“This recovery is largely attributed to the easing of monetary policy, assuming the productive use of private-sector credit,” the multilateral funding agency said. “Private sector credit contracted in the last fiscal year due to the tighter regulation on working capital loans, high lending rates, and weak domestic demand.”“The reforms to improve the business environment could attract more private investment,” according to the World Bank.On Friday, the central bank announced it would review the current working capital loans guideline. Banks and financial institutions offer short-term working capital loans to finance a company’s everyday operations.At present, industrialists and businesspeople get working capital loans of up to 25 percent of their annual turnover.For those taking more working capital loans than the set threshold, the deadline for borrowers to repay the excess credit has been extended to mid-July 2025. The central bank said it aims to maintain seven months of forex reserves to cover goods and services imports in the ongoing fiscal year 2024-25. The central bank said it would coordinate with the government to formulate necessary laws to regulate and supervise savings and credit cooperatives.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged a risk to Nepal’s economy that could trigger social unrest if the ongoing cooperatives problems are not sorted out.It said that several cooperatives have collapsed in the past six months, causing a loss or freezing of client savings and creating small-scale social unrest. The IMF warned that problems in the savings and cooperatives sector are expanding.The leading cause of the failure is investment in illiquid and underperforming cooperatives’ assets, which impact repayment capacity, combined with some cases of fraud.The monetary policy said it would facilitate the government’s initiative to return Rs500,000 to each cooperatives depositor by recovering them from the directors’ properties.With a growing number of companies being blacklisted, the central bank said it had worked out a policy for the companies that are associated with the blacklisted companies but have not committed any offence.Under the policy, if one firm is blacklisted in a joint venture, it will not be mandatory to keep the other in the bad book if it has committed no offence.At present, if a person or organisation that is blacklisted owns 15 percent or more shares in any other firm, personally or institutionally, the director and executive head of such a firm or company can also be blacklisted. The central bank said it would provide collateral-free loans to migrant workers based on the assurance that remittances would be sent to the bank accounts in their home country.The NRB has extended the deadline for loan repayment to microfinance customers who failed to pay loans under various circumstances. Monetary policy has increased the limit on home loans. The bank said that the limit on home loans taken for the first time would be increased to Rs25 million from Rs20 million. It has increased the foreign exchange limit for Demand Draft/Telex Transfer facilities when importing goods to $50,000 from the existing $35,000.The existing limit for importing goods through ‘document against payment’ and ‘document against acceptance’ has been increased from $60,000 to $100,000.The monetary policy has removed the limit on share mortgage loans for institutions, which is currently Rs200 million. However, no new provision has been made on personal or individual loan limits. Currently, the share mortgage loan limit for individuals is Rs150 million, and individual share investors have been demanding an increase in this limit.  \nThe three-party mechanism formed to iron out differences on the amendment bill to Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act has decided to submit its report to the top leaders of three major political parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre—but only after final rounds of consultations with the stakeholders.A meeting of the mechanism comprising Ramesh Lekhak of the Nepali Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the CPN-UML, and Janardan Sharma of the Maoist Centre, on Friday claimed that they are very close to an ‘agreement in principle’. On Monday, the mechanism will hold discussions with Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Ajay Kumar Chaurasiya, secretary at the ministry, chairperson of the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the lower house, and secretaries of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. “We are very close to an agreement. The report will be submitted after discussions with stakeholders,” said Sharma, adding that the 18-year-long stalemate in the transitional justice process will soon end.The top leadership of the major parties had on July 1 constituted the three-member committee after the House committee, despite repeated attempts, failed to find a consensus on four key issues in the bill. After a month-long negotiation, the three-member mechanism has claimed to have found a way forward. It has agreed to classify arbitrary killings as serious violations of human rights, and reduce the sentencing by around 75 percent for those who cooperate in the investigation process.If Sharma’s claim is anything to go by, they aim to address the issue of former Maoist child soldiers by providing compensation while also ensuring reparations and relief for the families of security personnel who lost their lives or were injured during the insurgency.Members of the mechanism say they are finalising the process with victims’ interests at the forefront. However, both human rights activists and conflict victims have strongly objected to the agreement to reduce the punishment for serious violations of human rights by three-fourths. The agreement on reduced sentencing came weeks after the National Human Rights Commission came up with a similar recommendation. It said the jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws.“It seems the National Human Rights Commission is being used by the political leadership,” said Suman Adhikari, founding chairperson of the Conflict Victims Common Platform. Similarly, a group of human rights activists organised under the Accountability Watch Group, also has said it is inappropriate to legally bind the judiciary to grant excessive immunity to those guilty of committing serious crimes by mandating reduced sentences. They argue that this undermines judicial independence and the victims’ right to effective legal remedy. While not entirely opposed to reduced sentencing, they demand that this specific provision be scrapped.The members of the mechanism say everyone should move ahead with the aim of settling the national issue. “We are working with a goal to get the bill endorsed from the ongoing session of Parliament,” said Bartaula. The House committee will finalise the bill based on the agreement reached in the three-member panel. It then needs to be endorsed by both the chambers of the federal parliament.The amendment bill was registered in the House of Representatives in March last year and sent to the parliamentary committee for finalisation. After over a year of discussions, the parliamentary committee narrowed down the differences to four points. There had been a broader understanding on two points—to classify arbitrary killings as serious violation of human rights (thus non-amnestiable), and to allow victims, who refuse to reconcile, to seek prosecution. However, other issues remained unaddressed, prompting the major parties to form the three-member panel. \nDrinking water samples collected from the “Drugs-Free Society”, a Thaiba-based rehab hit by a cholera outbreak, have tested positive for faecal coliform.Officials at the Health Office Lalitpur, have reported the presence of the deadly microbes in all water samples including those from the water utility and well water.“Faecal coliform, a deadly microbe, has been detected in all water samples from the cholera-hit rehab,”said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. “We have started chlorinating the water to tackle the contamination.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. The presence of faecal coliform means that the drinking water being used by locals of Thaiba is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.At least four people had tested positive for cholera that spread in the Thaiba-based rehab earlier this week.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Of the four infected patients, one in serious condition was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu. Another patient, who was admitted in the same hospital, was discharged on Wednesday, but has not gone home because the rehab has closed and he has nowhere else to go. Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As monsoon season is an epidemic season, in which most sources of drinking water get contaminated, presence of deadly microbes—E coli, faecal coliform in drinking water is not unusual during the monsoon season, health officials say. Even jar water, which is widely considered safer compared to water from other sources, gets contaminated during the monsoon season.What concerns them much is the apathy of the responsible agencies in launching awareness drives about the risks and other preventive measures. Most local authorities across the country halted testing of drinking water just before the start of monsoon citing budget constraints.Doctors say this is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved significantly.“Consumption of water contaminated with human faeces causes diarrheal infections,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Whatever the source, one must ensure that water is safe before drinking.”According to Basaula, the number of diarrheal cases has started rising in the hospital, and contaminated water and food are the main culprits. He said there are chances of outbreaks of diarrheal infections in multiple places where water from contaminated sources is being distributed.“Around six diarrheal patients seek treatment in our hospital every day,” said Basaula. “One must be careful about the quality of food and water before consumption.”Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the chances of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.Initiating awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from water-borne diseases, according to them. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of infection, they say. \nNepal’s judo player Manita Shrestha Pradhan will face Marica Perisic of Serbia in the women’s 57 kg weight category Elimination Round of 32 at the Paris Olympics on Monday.Shrestha Pradhan has been drawn in Pool A in the women’s judo competition which will be held at the Grand Palais Ephemere in Paris.If Shrestha Pradhan beats the Serbian, she will meet the winners between Mariama Koroma of Sierra Leone and Lien Chen-ling of Chinese Taipei in the round of 16.Shrestha Pradhan secured her place at the Olympics through continental quota based on Olympic point rankings.Nepal has sent seven athletes to Paris 2024.Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha and badminton’s Prince Dahal are in action on Saturday.Nepal is making its debut in both badminton and table tennis in Paris.Santoo, who is the only third Nepali player to qualify for the Olympics via qualification tournament after taekwondo’s Sangina Baidya (Athens 2004) and Deepak Bista (Beijing 2008), will face Diaw Ibrahima of Senegal in the men’s singles preliminary round.Santoo will progress to the round of 16 if he beats Ibrahima.Dahal, who entered the Paris 2024 on universality spot, will meet world number two Viktor Axelsen of Denmark in his opening game of Group P, which also includes Ireland’s Nhat Nguyen and Israel’s Misha Zilberman.A total of 41 players (from 36 countries)—split into 13 groups of three or four—are competing in the men’s singles badminton. The group winners will advance to the knockout stage. Each game of the round-robin tournament will be played in a best-of-three format.Shooter Sushmita Nepal is competing in the women’s 10 m air rifle, which will be held on Sunday.Swimmers Duana Lama and Alexander Shah will compete in women’s 200 m freestyle and men’s 100 m freestyle events, respectively.Lama is in action on Sunday while Shah will contest on Tuesday.Long-distance runner Santoshi Shrestha will participate in the women's marathon on August 11, the final day of Paris 2024. \nAccording to Nietzsche, “Art helps us to know ‘how to make things beautiful, as either creators or enjoyers; as the latter, we can be poets of our lives and give ourselves satisfaction and style, treating our own lives as a creative work and giving it aesthetic value as part of its ethical character. And this requires that we be autonomous individuals, free spirits, rejecting the restrictions that society and conventional morality seek to impose.”The above paragraph is an extract from AC Grayling’s book ‘The History of Philosophy’. The passage rightly encapsulates the essence of the ongoing exhibition at Nepal Art Council, ‘Rasa Lila: The Divine Dance.’‘Rasa Lila’ embodies everything unconventional and unique. It doesn't conform to typical norms but instead aligns with the authentic way an individual is likely to perceive things. The artists behind the exhibition are Priyam Pradhan, Utsab BS Pradhan, Urza Acharya, Binit Maharjan, Julian Shakya, Smarika Phuyal, Shristika Yonzon, and Shubi Lama, who hail from diverse disciplines. The show is unlike any other exhibition in Kathmandu. For instance, the regular clay sculptures have been replaced by carbon steel sculptures and the use of jenga blocks, and the installed headphones act as a phone booth for the emotions embodied in the statues.Moreover, the adjustment of light is done so skillfully that it creates the illusion of multiplying the presented figures, adding dynamism to its display.As I perceived, the theme of the exhibition revolves around fusing the contemporary world with the mythological world of Mahabharata.Jawaharlal Nehru, in his book ‘The Discovery of India’, mentions that myths provide insights into the thoughts and emotions of people throughout history, reflecting their aspirations, fears, and societal norms.In a similar vein, with its aim to compare the myths of yesterday with today’s spectacle, the angles used in creating this exhibition represent contemporary perspectives, offering a fresh interpretation of timeless narratives such as Mahabharata itself. One of the artists, Priyam Pradhan, who is ready to start his academic life abroad, said, “This exhibition marks the celebration of departure and acceptance of the fact that we will have to move away and find our footing in the world.”Similar to his saying, the exhibition makes the spectators enter the world of Vraja, the highest domain of the heavenly world. Examining the atmosphere of the exhibition, the descriptions of the exhibit labels come to life, providing a sense of calmness and serenity as they begin their observation.The story of the exhibition begins with Krishna dancing with the Gopis before he leaves to fulfil his duty of freeing his birth parents from the claws of Kamsa, his uncle and the tyrant ruler of Mathura.While Krishna is fully absorbed in performing ‘Rasa Lila’, Shiva, along with his consort Parvati, arrives to participate in the dance. However, Shiva is restricted from participating. The lack of ‘Sakhibhav’—seeing onset as a companion or friend of the divine—prevents Shiva from joining in the celebration.As somebody who was educated in an all-girls school, this particular instance transported me back to my school days, making me home-sick of the strong bond that I shared with my girlfriends.Contrary to my current environment, which lacks that understanding and connection, especially with boys, this feeling of nostalgia gets well articulated in the concept of Sakibhav.Adamant to participate in the zesty celebration, Shiva turns himself into Gopeshwor Mahadev, a beautiful maiden who can take part in the ‘Rasa Lila’.With ghungroo tinkling in a feminine foot contrasted with the depiction of masculine dancing hands, the structure cleverly illustrates Gopeshwor Mahadev dancing with the Gopis.The holy Yamuna river, flowing beside the beautiful Vraja, has symbolic meaning according to the way it is presented in the exhibition. The river is scattered with the jumbled letters of the names of the exhibition's creators, hinting at civilization's ever-flowing nature.Just like the scattered letters represent the intertwined history, the river has long absorbed the ashes of people from various backgrounds. This makes one realise that nature is not to be owned but to be appreciated and preserved. The exhibition also represents Draupadi’s vastraharan (disrobing). In the dramatic episode of the Indian Epic, Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, is humiliated in the Kaurava court after the Pandavas lose a game of dice to the Kauravas.As a punishment, the Kaurava prince Dushasana tries to disrobe Draupadi, but Lord Krishna provides her with an endless supply of cloth, preventing her from being stripped.However, while Draupadi suffers indignity, her family members remain tight-lipped and do nothing on their part to save her from the plight she is facing.A white saree symbolises Draupadi’s ordeal, and the ending of her saree after being saved by Lord Krishna is depicted in blue. A red light on the head of the statue represents Draupadi's anger towards her family members. Similarly, to help spectators truly connect with Draupadi's plight, a song by artist Smarika Phuyal has been installed in the exhibition, which spectators can listen to from headphones.Rather than concentrating on the well-known discourse of Draupadi’s plight as a ‘Damsel in Distress’, the exhibition highlights a new perspective. It calls out the paradoxical nature of today's people, who claim to uphold morals and ethics while frequently acting against these principles.Likewise, blending contemporary fashion with classical mythology, the exhibition offers a fresh representation of the Pandavas. The innovative approach of representing the Pandava brothers with t-shirts of different colours is something that one rarely comes across in an exhibition.The exhibition has also made a substantial effort to showcase the predicament of modern-day Draupadi through a documentary presentation.Documentarian Urza Acharya outlines the theme of her documentary, “One cannot always dwell on happy moments. To enjoy the true embrace of delightful times, one must partake in the adventure of life, which has its challenges and less exciting aspects.” The five-minute documentary titled ‘God of Small Things’ revolves around the inner turmoil of the protagonist, who is dressed in a pink dress with tinkling ghungroos.She often pendulums between two extremes leaving a grey area. The grey area is marked with her being close with herself through the performance of mundane and small tasks.“By fixing small things, I am confronted with my honest self, the small things end up fixing me too.”In an era where a person’s identity is often recognised by great achievements attained through complying with the set standards of society, the documentary provides a respite from this routine.It instead voices the perspective that the pursuit of greatness shouldn’t be one’s core conquest in life. There is a profound wholeness to be discovered in the mundane.To sum up, from a philosophical perspective, the exhibition can be compared to Neitzche’s pressing question, “How were we to find meaning and purpose in a post-religious world?”Just like philosopher Heidegger developed a new approach to address Nietzche’s question, the eight artists of this exhibition offer a fresh perspective on interpreting mythologies.The eight artists in this exhibition do not reject religious traditions; instead, they provide contemporary insights that reinterpret and breathe new life into these narratives.In this way, the exhibition serves as a modern response to age-old questions, blending classical themes with innovative approaches to offer viewers a deeper understanding of both past and present.Rasa Lila: The Divine DanceWhere: Nepal Art Council, BabarmahalTimings: 10:00 am to 5:00 pmEntry: FreeTill August 3 \nNepal will launch their CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League campaign against Sri Lanka at the National Sports Council covered hall in Kathmandu on August 1, the opening day of the tournament.Five countries—Hosts Nepal, India, the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Iran—are competing for the trophy.India are also in action against Iran on the opening day.Nepal next face India on August 2, the Maldives on August 4 and Iran on August 5.The top four teams will advance into the semi-finals, which are scheduled for August 6.The group winners of the single-round league will take on the fourth placed team, while the group-runners will lock horns with the third-placed team in the last four clashes.The final and the third-place playoff will be held on August 7.  \nThe Parliamentary Hearing Committee has scheduled its meeting for Monday to decide on election commissioner nominee Krishna Man Pradhan.According to Padma Prasad Pandey, the general secretary at the Federal Parliament secretariat, the committee meeting has been called at 11 am on Monday.The meeting of the Constitutional Council held on June 16 had recommended Pradhan for the post of election commissioner.The Council’s decision to nominate Pradhan for the constitutional body courted controversy after a woman filed a complaint at the hearing committee accusing Pradhan of sexually abusing her years. The woman, who was invited to a committee meeting, also narrated about the issue in detail to the committee members.The committee’s meeting held on Wednesday ended inconclusively citing further discussion was needed on the allegations made against the proposed commissioner.During the hearing, cross-party lawmakers asked Pradhan how he would defend the serious allegations of sexual abuse and whether he was morally corrupt. Most members of the 15-strong committee had asked him how he was eligible to hold the constitutional position despite the serious allegations.A two-thirds majority of the 15-strong committee, which has lawmakers from both chambers of Parliament, can reject the nomination. \nFamily members of 17 out of 18 people killed in the Saurya Airlines crash have received the bodies of their relatives as of Saturday evening.Relatives of the deceased, who had earlier refused to receive the bodies demanding that the government and airlines guarantee compensation and insurance issues first, accepted the bodies after the officials promised to address their concerns. According to Deputy Inspector General of Police Dan Bahadur Karki, all the bodies except for the body of Aref Reda, a Yemeni national, have been handed over to the family members.Most of the bodies were identified by Friday. However, there had been issues in identifying the severely charred bodies. A large team of doctors worked to identify the victims as quickly as possible, according to officials.Saurya Airlines officials have committed that the company would provide as much support as possible to the victims’ families.“We assure the victims’ families that we will provide all possible support and assistance,” Saurya Airlines Chairman Dipak Kumar Pokharel said in a statement on Friday.Eighteen of the 19 people aboard a Pokhara-bound aircraft of the Saurya Airlines died when the plane crashed shortly after it took off from the Tribhuvan International Airport on Wednesday.Captain Manish Ratna Shakya, the lone survivor of the crash, is recuperating at a hospital in Kathmandu.  \nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has its feet in two boats: Business and regulation. This is always a recipe for disaster. And in Nepal’s aviation sector, disasters are aplenty. Under the current director general, Pradeep Adhikari, Nepal has seen seven air crashes. In the past year-and-a-half alone, over 100 people have been killed in plane crashes. And no, the director-general hasn’t resigned yet, he in fact continues to vehemently defend his sullied record. The terms ‘accountability’ and ‘humility’ are clearly missing from his book of ethics. With the right connections across the political spectrum, he has no moral or political pressure to resign. The half-mast national flag does his task of hanging his head in shame.A European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) delegation that conducted an on-site assessment of Nepal’s air safety last September pointed out several safety concerns, clearly mentioning a couple of airline carriers and CAAN as the offending parties. An assessment report submitted to CAAN’s Adhikari raised concerns about discrepancies in the work of the Flight Operations Division and the Airworthiness Inspection Division. It noted significant gaps in overseeing fatigue related to duty period regulations and ensuring comprehensive compliance checks. The report also suggested improvement in CAAN’s oversight capabilities, personnel management, staff training and certification processes.How the CAAN has responded to the European Commission’s concerns about Nepal’s air safety over the years is there for all to see: More crashes and more killings. The commission’s request to bifurcate the civil aviation body into regulatory and service-providing institutions has fallen on deaf ears. Similarly, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Nations aviation watchdog, asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body and ensure a proper regulatory system two years ago. Not splitting the CAAN has created a serious conflict of interest as the same institution seeks to provide service as well as to make profit. However, Adhikari kept the report a secret, continuing to stall efforts to split CAAN.A poignant case of regulation failure was evident in the death of the wife and son of a technician who were among the 18 individuals killed in the Saurya Air crash near the runway of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on Wednesday. The ferry flight to Pokhara on a full maintenance mission was not supposed to carry common passengers, but it did—an egregious violation of air safety rules. As corruption and lack of accountability run rampant in Nepal’s aviation industry, with little adherence to existing regulations, air travel continues to be a risky endeavour.The captain of the ill-fated Bombardier CRJ200, who miraculously survived the crash, has made an initial statement that he could not control the aircraft after it took an altitude of a hundred feet after take-off. He would be in a position to provide more insight into the events leading up to the fatal crash of the aircraft when he regains his health. In Nepal, there has been a tradition of putting all the blame on human agency, meaning the captain, after all fatal air crashes, without making any effort to strengthen air safety regulations. No corrupt leader or bureaucrat should be allowed to perennially stop the bifurcation of CAAN and to continue to let our skies be aerial death traps.   \nUnintended pregnancy, teenage pregnancy and induced abortive procedures with complications are some common reproductive health problems affecting millions of females worldwide. These issues are major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity in South Asia, posing a significant challenge to women’s sexual and reproductive health as well as social well-being and economic prospects.In Nepal, nearly half of the pregnancies are unintended and 60 percent of them end up in abortion. This directly correlates with gender inequality, socio-economic status and restrictions on sexual and reproductive rights. Early and unintended pregnancies also pose a huge barrier to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3.7, which ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning, information and education and integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. Nepal's National Planning Commission 2020 states, \"The government of Nepal’s target for SDG 3.7.1, is that 74% of allwomen age 15–49 have a met need for family planning with modern methods by 2022 and 80% by 2030.\"Advancement of contraceptivesOver the past few decades, there have been tremendous advances in the development of new contraceptive technologies, and a wide variety of family planning methods have been introduced. According to the National Demographic Health Survey 2022 (NDHS), 57 percent of currently married women are using a method of contraception, 43 percent are using a modern technique, and 15 percent are using a traditional method. There has been a decline in the unmet need for family planning from 32 percent in 1996 to 21 percent in 2022, which is possibly due to contraceptives.While different methods of contraception have prevented unintended pregnancies, emergency contraceptives are on the rise today. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are safe and effective drugs, recommended to be used within 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse, after accidents like condom rupture or missed pills, or if women are forced against their will to prevent pregnancy. ECPs help women avoid the adverse outcomes of unwanted pregnancies and reduce the risk of induced abortion. Offering emergency contraception is a crucial service delivery intervention for reducing this unmet need for contraception. As the name itself says, emergency contraceptives are intended only for occasional and emergency use. Counselling for the use of these pills should include options for regular contraception and advice on the correct methods in cases of perceived method failure. Concerns regarding ECPsNepal first introduced emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) through a social marketing programme in 2004. Since then, its use has risen, particularly in the last decade. The serious concerns regarding the potential use of ECP as a substitute for other contraceptives are similar to those voiced in response to the increased use of abortion in Nepal. The increased availability of over-the-counter and easy accessibility of emergency contraceptives has raised concerns regarding their safe use, misuse and potential consequences. The trend of taking ECPs as an alternative method of contraception should be seriously considered, particularly among youth. The wide advertisements, banners and posters around street corners stating it is an “easy way to the difficult situation” have misled them to either abandon or consider not using the contraceptive method regularly. It provides easy options for women to avoid unwanted or unplanned births without having to face social stigmatisation.Globally, the increasing use of ECPs has been described as an epidemic in which women are reportedly “eating contraceptives like chocolates” in Kenya and “popping them like candy” in India. The condition is similar in the context of Nepal today, where the pills are taken as a substitute for regular contraceptives. It might replace the regular use of oral combined pills, which in turn can lead to menstrual irregularities because of off-and-on withdrawal bleeding. This problem not only harms women but also potentially increases sexually transmitted diseases (STI) and HIV when condom use is replaced by repeated, indiscriminate use of emergency contraceptives. It will also deprive young women and girls of reaching out to the gynaecologist for appropriate counselling services and to consider various options regarding regular contraceptives. There is no doubt that emergency contraceptives provide a woman with the opportunity to have unprotected intercourse and ensure that every pregnancy is wanted. However, repeated misuse of emergency contraceptives needs to be evaluated for a better understanding of the positive and negative impacts of ECPs, which is critical in guiding the discourse in the right direction. Existing policies lack comprehensive implementation guidelines for the distribution of emergency contraceptive pills, necessitating integration. Comprehensive sexual health programmes and education campaigns through social media, workshops, community outreach initiatives on reproductive health and family planning methods and emergency contraceptives should be conducted. Health education on ECPs should be integrated into the curriculum to bridge the knowledge gap among youths. Similarly, equipping teachers to offer detailed sex education in urban and rural schools, incorporating public education campaigns to raise awareness about ECPs and their importance as a backup method of contraception, integrating counselling services into healthcare settings, and enhancing the competencies of paramedics, community leaders and female community health volunteers to provide basic adolescent services are urgently needed. The media, programme implementors, service providers, decision-makers and policymakers should have the right and accurate information on ECPs. There is an urgent need to disseminate information regarding family planning, pregnancy risks and contraceptive use to dispel myths and ensure the proper use of ECPs. An integrated approach is required to address the interrelated factors and create an enabling environment in which adolescents are fully aware, informed and equipped to properly utilise contraceptives and related services. As Jeff Sheffield, chairman of FIGO’s Contraception and Family Planning Committee, said, “Globally, young people, especially adolescents, do not have access to reliable, up-to-date information related to sexual and reproductive health, including contraception. This information can help inform their decisions and potentially save lives.” Let’s ponder this issue seriously.  \nNepal boasts a history of 110 years of undertaking decennial population censuses, starting from 1911. The recent Nepal Population and Housing Census (NPHC), conducted from November 11 to 25, 2021, is the 12th in this series. The initial four censuses, conducted before 1950, are not considered scientific. However, the censuses conducted after 1952-54 have been meticulously designed to generate valuable statistics and indicators. These indicators assess the situation of various special population groups, including women, children, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities and migrants, as well as changes over time. The 2021 census holds particular significance as it was conducted after the nation incorporated a federal government. This transition marked a new era in Nepal’s administrative and political landscape. Additionally, the 2021 census was completed after numerous setbacks and reorganisations brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. Initially scheduled for June 8 to 22, 2021, the dates were postponed to November 11 to 25, 2021 due to pandemic-induced disruptions.Wealth indexAn index is a statistical technique used to combine various indicators into a single numerical score, simplifying complex data into an easily interpretable format. Composite scores are commonly used to monitor and evaluate the performance of different issues. In this context, the performance of the census findings is assessed using the wealth index. The \"wealth index\" was calculated using household characteristics, service utilities and amenities data from the NPHC 2021. This method is widely recognised for constructing such indices. The wealth index is based on 17 factors, including nine household assets, four services and four dwelling quality variables. These factors are the materials used in the foundation of the house, outer wall, roof, floor, the main source of drinking water, usual fuel for cooking and lighting and toilet facility, availability and type of toilet facility. The nine household assets include television, landline phone, smartphone, computer/laptop, internet, car/jeep/van, motorcycle/scooter, refrigerator and washing machine. These indices were estimated and presented in the given table: The wealth distribution data reveals significant disparities across Nepal's provinces. More than half of the households in Karnali (51.3 percent) were in the poorest quintile, while only 4 percent were in the wealthiest. Similarly, one-third (33.9 percent) of households from Sudurpashchim were in the poorest quintile, compared to eight percent in the richest. In contrast, two-fifths (38 percent) of households in Bagmati were in the richest quintile, highlighting a stark contrast with provinces like Madhesh, where only nine percent of households were in the richest category. Implications for policy and planning The wealth distribution data from the 2021 census provides essential insights for targeted policy interventions. The pronounced economic disparities necessitate a multifaceted approach to fostering equitable development across Nepal. Infrastructure development necessitates investing in basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity and water supply in poorer regions, which can significantly improve living standards and economic opportunities. Education and healthcare seek enhanced access to quality education; healthcare is crucial for long-term socioeconomic upliftment. These services are foundational for human capital development, which in turn drives economic growth. Economic policies require implementing policies aimed at boosting local economies, such as promoting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and improving market access for local products, which can stimulate economic activity and job creation. Leveraging strengths Wealthier provinces like Bagmati serve as models for successful economic strategies that can be adapted and implemented in less developed regions. To prevent further widening of regional disparities, it is essential to ensure that the benefits of wealth in these provinces are equally distributed. A balanced approach that addresses the needs of poorer regions while leveraging the strengths of wealthier areas can promote more inclusive and sustainable growth across Nepal. Likewise, continuous monitoring and evaluation of socioeconomic indicators are vital to assess the effectiveness of interventions and make necessary adjustments.The wealth distribution analysis from the 2021 NPHC underscores the critical need for strategic and equitable economic policies in Nepal. We can reduce regional disparities and foster inclusive growth only by focusing on targeted interventions for the most impoverished regions and ensuring a balanced national development strategy.  \nNepali political parties of the Left, Right and Centre never tire of speaking about democracy. Their concern is often about democracy being in some kind of danger, although it is mostly a case of false flagging. But there is one kind of democracy they rarely talk about—the intra-party sort. Practising internal democracy seems much more difficult than seeking it elsewhere. A couple of party conventions in the past few months have highlighted the lack of internal democracy among Nepali political parties. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), which concluded its three-day ‘unity general convention’ on June 12, elected Upendra Yadav as chairperson. Although the party announced its central committee members and central executive committee members after a month of the convention, it has failed to pick office bearers. Likewise, the CPN (Unified Socialist), which completed its six-day ‘national convention’ on July 5, elected Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, and Ghanashyam Bhusal as chairman, senior leader, and general secretary, respectively, through consensus among the party’s top leaders. However, the party has yet to name its 206 central committee members and 18 office bearers.Once Yadav of the JSP-Nepal was elected to the chair unopposed, he halted the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13. Twenty-three candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons, and six were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—had filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary. Similarly, the Unified Socialist has yet to appoint 206 of 299 central committee members and 18 of 21 committee members in addition to finalising standing committee and politburo members. Party insiders say the top brass was busy scrutinising the backgrounds of the aspirants before making a final selection. But scrutinising may mean picking ‘yes’ men and women, especially considering the volatile nature of these parties which are either splinters from a big party or have seen their colleagues break away to form other parties.Apart from these rather fringe parties in Parliament, those that are more mainstream also struggle with the question of internal democracy. The Rastriya Swatantra Party’s joint meeting of central committee and parliamentary party set the tone for the party’s cult culture, with Rabi Lamichhane picking officer bearers considered close to him. There have also been controversies regarding an alleged manipulation of the proportional representation list to include near and dear ones of the party top brass.The situation in the top three parties—Nepali Congress, CPN (UML) and Maoist Centre—is no better. The Congress reflects a perennial vertical division of the Deuba and Koirala camps; the UML is increasingly being consolidated around the “father” figure of KP Sharma Oli, and the Maoists remain as enamoured as ever by the authoritative personality of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. With individual preferences rather than democratic values ruling the roost, the parties sustain on a feudal system offering handouts, or “tika” in the local parlance, to the sycophants while pushing away those who work hard and question the top brass. If there is one sphere that has seen a thriving “Afno Manchhe” culture—which anthropologist Dor Bahadur Bista so eloquently critiqued in his book Fatalism and Development—it is the political parties of Nepal today.  \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump plans a campaign rally on Saturday in Minnesota as he tries to recapture momentum after Vice President Kamala Harris' whirlwind week that saw her emerge as his new Democratic opponent.Trump's event with vice presidential running mate Senator JD Vance brings him to a Midwestern state that has not chosen a Republican presidential candidate in 52 years, as the former president seeks to press into territory that became friendlier in the last few months before President Joe Biden, 81, dropped his reelection bid.Harris, the first Black woman and first Asian American to serve as vice president, swiftly consolidated Democratic support after Biden tapped her to succeed him on Sunday, and a handful of public opinion polls show her appearing to have made up some of the ground Biden lost after a disastrous debate performance.Trump's campaign event in St. Cloud, Minnesota, will take place in an 8,000-seat hockey arena, an indoor venue that complies with the U.S. Secret Service's recommendation that he avoid large outdoor events following the attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally two weeks ago.No Republican presidential candidate has won Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972.Harris, 59, will attend a private fundraiser on Saturday after a series of campaign stops this week in which she laid out the themes that will animate her campaign. She sought to contrast her background as a prosecutor with Trump's record as a convicted felon and argued that her campaign is about looking to the future, while Trump's wants to take the country into the past.Her ascension to the top of the ticket has reenergized a campaign that had faltered badly amid Democrats doubts about Biden's chances of defeating Trump, 78, or his ability to continue to govern should he succeed. She raised more than $100 million in the 36 hours after Biden's departure, according to her campaign.Trump and Vance, 39, have attempted to tie Harris to what they say is the Biden administration's failure to corral high inflation and stem a surge of migrants at the southern border with Mexico. Republicans have also portrayed Harris as more liberal and extreme than Biden.Earlier on Saturday, Trump is set to speak at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, part of a broader Republican effort to court crypto holders ahead of the Nov. 5 election. The party has promised lighter regulation for crypto, while Trump recently slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector.The former president indicated he would like to see expanded bitcoin mining by U.S. firms, even though he called bitcoin a \"scam\" in 2021.\"It's not a shift in the Republican Party as much as it is a revolution,\" Republican Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee told Reuters this week at the conference.Trump will host a fundraiser in Nashville prior to his remarks at the conference, with tickets ranging from $60,000 to over $800,000 per person. Donors can contribute via digital currency as well, according to an event invitation. \nA protest following the death of 17-year-old Nasib Chaudhary of Kanchanpur Belauri-2 turned violent as relatives hurled stones at Dhangadhi-based Nova Hospital on Saturday.Police deployed nine rounds of tear gas shells to quell the unrest after relatives accused the hospital administration of negligence in Nasib's treatment leading to his death.He was initially admitted to Nova Hospital on July 22 for treatment and was diagnosed with jaundice. However, later the hospital had urged the relatives to transfer him to a well-equipped hospital in Nepalgunj or India. Chaudhary passed away en route to Nepalgunj at around 3.30 pm on Friday. The relatives of the deceased accused the hospital administration of not informing them about the deteriorating condition of the patient in time. They also accused the hospital of delaying in releasing the patient asking for full payment before his discharge. Ram Krishna Chaudhary, the maternal uncle of the teenager, claimed that Nasib would not have died had he been allowed to be transferred to other hospitals on time.“First they did not allow us to take the patient to another hospital asking us to clear the dues, when they let us it was too late,” he said.The deceased's relatives have refused to claim his body, demanding accountability from the hospital staff and compensation for the loss. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be Partly to generally cloudy on Saturday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of the country with chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places in the Bagmati and Sudur Pashchim Province.Tonight the weather is expected to be generally cloudy throughout the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province as well as a few places in the rest of the country.The meteorological forecasting division has warned of chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places in the Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province and Sudur Pashchim Province.The maximum temperature on Thursday was recorded at 38 degrees Celsius in Janakpur, while the lowest recorded temperature was 16 degrees Celsius in Jomsom. \nVajra Books and Publications has published the English translation and scientific analysis of the Muluki Ain, first drafted by Janga Bahadur Rana in 1854. This text, a major milestone for the archiving of Nepali historical documents, was translated by Rajan Khatiwoda, Simon Cubelic, and Axel Michaels, a team created in collaboration with Heidelberg University.The first Muluki Ain was considered an important document not only in Nepali but also in South Asian history. It was created to replace sporadic regional law systems of various parts of the country and unify them through a single legal system. Although the text is traditionally accredited to Janga Bahadur Rana, a fact our authors also acknowledge in this translation piece, it was most possibly drafted by a council of prominent lawmakers.The team behind this translated piece is especially dedicated to South Asian legal history. Khatiwoda completed his PhD on the Homicidal Law of 19th-century Nepal, based on various versions of the Muluki Ain. Cubelic, with his PhD in Hindu Legal Scriptures (Dharmashastra), and Michaels, a senior professor at Heidelberg University focusing on South Asian text culture and language, are also experts in this field.The translation brings the various legislatures of 19th-century Nepal to the eye of a larger readership. Some highlights of the Muluki Ain are its highlighting of laws around caste and family systems, purity and sexuality, and punishment systems. These punishment systems also include penalties for acts ranging from stealing, murder and other crimes, to smaller grievances, like punishments for spitting and farting. The text acts as a time capsule for enthusiasts of early Rana history.The authors believe that their text was primarily created to make Nepal’s first written law more accessible to scholars, local and Global, especially those interested in the legal and political systems of South Asia. Khatiwoda adds, “We believe that the book will assist scholars, researchers, and those with interest in related materials to comprehend the immediate social, economic, and political environment of South Asia and Nepal.”Although initially published by Heidelberg University, Vajra Publications has now released the book to make it easily accessible to Nepalese and South Asian audiences. \n'Love and Rain' by Carmela Circelli explores entangled relationships, human fragility, love, beauty, and resilience amidst themes of history, betrayal, and political resistance.\nIn Nepal's corruption-ridden aviation industry, a seventh fatal crash occurred on January 15, 2023, raising concerns over safety and the lack of separation between regulatory and operational functions within the Civil Aviation Authority.\nSeven Nepali athletes will compete in seven events at the 2024 Paris Olympics with the ambitious goal of winning the country's first official medal, including debuts in badminton and table tennis and a return to the women's marathon.\nNepal's new Cabinet under PM Oli has just two women out of 22 members, marking a significant regression from the previous term's 20% representation, raising concerns about gender equality and social inclusion in the country.\nBudget cuts threaten family planning services, potentially leading to increased unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and maternal/child mortality rates amid declining population growth.\nJSP-Nepal and CPN (Unified Socialist) held unity/national conventions, electing leaders but delaying the completion of their convention processes, including the appointment of central committee members, office bearers, and other committee positions.\nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\n\nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has once again defended Deputy Speaker Indira Rana, who has landed in a controversy over requesting in writing the US Embassy for visa interview dates.The party has accused the ruling parties of trying to scandalise the “trivial” issue with a malafide intention to unseat her.A central committee meeting of the RSP on Thursday concluded that the coalition of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress, which is in minority in the Constitutional Council, wanted to remove Rana and get a lawmaker from their parties to replace her. Besides the roles in the legislature, the Deputy Speaker is also a member of the Council that elects chiefs and members of constitutional bodies and the chief justice.The chief justice, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly chair, the leader of the main opposition in the House and the Deputy Speaker are members of the Constitutional Council, which is headed by the prime minister. The UML, which now leads the coalition government involving the Congress and some fringe parties, has two seats in the Constitutional Council. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and House Speaker Devraj Ghimire are from the second-largest party. (Though a Speaker resigns from all party positions after being appointed to lead the House, s/he hardly is aloof from their party in practice as they mostly rejoin it after the completion of the tenure). The CPN (Maoist Centre) is as strong as the UML in the council. Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as the leader of the opposition, and National Assembly chair Narayan Prasad Dahal are members of the Council.If Deputy Speaker Rana resigns, then the ruling coalition can appoint a lawmaker from one of its components in her position and secure a majority in the Council, even if the chief justice stays neutral in constitutional appointments, RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha said. That the ruling parties had blown the issue out of proportion 18 months after the letter addressed to the embassy made it clear that it was politically motivated, he claimed. Deputy Speaker Rana on February 26 last year wrote a letter to the US Embassy, requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. She faces pressure to quit, after the letter was leaked recently.She requested the embassy to arrange interview dates for six people, including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar, and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter. Rana had written that she wanted the interview dates to be preponed as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, scheduled to be held in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023. Experts and retired parliamentary officials criticised her for corresponding with diplomatic agencies without informing the Parliament Secretariat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.After the central committee meeting on Thursday, RSP officials tried to downplay the issue saying that their inquiry had found that the letter hadn’t been registered at the US Embassy in Kathmandu.“The letter has not been registered at the embassy. Nor do we have the evidence of any financial dealings,” said Jha.On July 21, RSP lawmaker Sumana Shrestha, defending Rana in Parliament, said that a media trial was underway to assassinate the character of the Deputy Speaker. Shrestha had said they were ready to leave the post if the ruling parties asked for it. “If you need a seat on the Constitutional Council, ask for it. But a woman’s character should not be assassinated in this manner,” Shrestha had said. After the central committee meeting on Thursday, Jha said allegations against Deputy Speaker Rana were discussed in the central committee.“We challenge the other parties to prove that the letter was registered at the Embassy,” Jha told the Post. “During our informal investigation, we found that no recommendation letter by Rana was registered at the US Embassy.” He added that the letter was dated 18 months ago, and no one was found to have taken any benefits from the recommendation. Her intentions were not wrong, Jha said.Since the deputy Speaker is no longer a member of the party, RSP was not in a position to make any organisational decision related to her, he added.“Complaints against her have been filed to the Parliament Secretariat and the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the legislature. Our party will form an opinion if needed based on the decision they make.” The party meeting also reached a decision to form a panel under the discipline committee to review all allegations the party faces. The meeting decided to form an 11-member statute amendment recommendation committee led by acting RSP General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti. \nThe ruling and opposition parties have started a blame game over Deputy Speaker Indira Rana's move to write a letter to the American Embassy in Kathmandu to allocate convenient visa interview dates for individuals without clear statuses.While some ruling party lawmakers demanded a probe into the matter, opposition lawmakers including those from the Rastriya Swatantra Party said it was a non issue.During the special time in the House of Representatives on Sunday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada demanded a committee to probe the correspondence by Rana.\"A letter requesting dates for US visas has been received. Can the Deputy Speaker still command Parliament?\" he asked. \"There is the Parliament Secretariat to facilitate the visa process if anyone of Parliament has to travel abroad. The Deputy Speaker has breached the norm by writing the letter herself.\"He claimed Rana's move had brought shame not just to Parliament but the whole country. \"The Deputy Speaker's Office cannot act as a consultancy to facilitate the visa process,\" he said.On February 26, 2023 she had written to the consular general at the Embassy of the United States in Kathmandu to arrange interview dates for six people including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter.Rana wrote that as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York on March 6 to 17, 2023, she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. She is now being criticised for misusing her position to make undiplomatic requests.Deputy Speaker, a constitutional position, is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council that recommends chiefs and members of constitutional bodies and the chief justice.Opposition lawmakers, however, claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. Sumana Shrestha, a Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) lawmaker, said Rana's character was being assassinated because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. The council has two members each from the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), one from the RSP and the next is the chief justice.\"Ask for [Rana's] support, we can give. But can you ruin the character of someone by calling them a human trafficker [because the ruling alliance is in a minority]?\" she asked. \"Character assisination is unacceptable. Let us check how everyone has used their letterheads in the past.”She said there must be the criteria for using the letter. She accused the major parties of resorting to a media trial of the deputy Speaker.Stating that the world knows how a lawmaker behaved in Parliament and on the streets demanding visa for an individual, she said the current criticism was nothing but a planned move against Rana. Gyan Bahadur Shahi, a Rastriya Prajatantra Party lawmaker, had led a mass protest against the US Embassy for denying visa to cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane.Though there can be moral questions for writing the letter, Madhav Sapkota, a CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker, said, the way the letter was brought to the public domain now gives enough room to suspect the motive.\"We condemn the move if it is being done with an aim to bulldoze decisions from the Constitutional Council,\" he said. \"As an opposition party, we will strongly oppose such moves.\" Rana also claims that there have been coordinated attempts to attack her. Issuing a statement on Friday, she said, “The attempt to scandalise the letter I wrote out of compassion, after a year and a half, is nothing but a move orchestrated against me,” reads the letter.“Those who know me well are aware of my nature. I may have many personal shortcomings, and there may be many who try to take advantage of that, but I have never engaged in unethical actions, nor will I ever do.\" Experts in the field say the issue is not as light as Rana is trying to portray.Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, said the deputy Speaker must be held accountable for her act.It would be hasty to conclude that writing the letter was an act of human trafficking, Thapa told the Post. “But it is clearly a misuse of authority.\"Rana must take responsibility for her wrongdoings, he said. Writing for herself was not a problem but including the names of those who are not related to Parliament in any way is problematic, Thapa argued.An official at the secretariat claimed that Rana had tried to get the secretariat to write the letter. That didn't happen as then-general secretary Bharat Raj Gautam didn't agree to it, said the official. \"She wrote the letter herself as the general secretary refused to involve the parliament secretariat in it.\" \nThe constitutional bench of the Supreme Court will hear a writ petition challenging the appointment of CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli as prime minister.A single bench of Justice Bal Krishna Dhakal on Sunday forwarded the case to the constitutional bench, citing the need for a ‘serious constitutional interpretation’.“The matter raised in the writ petition involves serious questions of constitutional interpretation, and its resolution should be done by the constitutional bench. Therefore, present it before the chief justice,” the order states.Advocates Deepak Adhikari, Khagendra Prasad Chapagain and Shailendra Kumar Gupta filed the petition on July 15, seeking a mandamus order to annul the appointment arguing that it was unconstitutional.The petitioners argue that the President should initiate the new government formation under Article 76(3) if a government formed under Article 76(2) fails to secure a vote of confidence.Article 76(2) states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the House, the President appoints as prime minister “a member of the House who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties.”Article 76(3) allows the President to appoint the parliamentary party leader of the largest party as prime minister, subjecting him to a vote of confidence within 30 days. Under the clause, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba would become prime minister as the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House.The Office of the President, the Federal Parliament Secretariat, Nepali Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli, among others, have been named defendants in the petition.President Ramchandra Paudel on July 15 appointed Oli as the prime minister after he staked his claim to the post with the support of 166 lawmakers.The President had made a call as per Article 76(2) of the constitution after Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was appointed under the same article, failed the floor test. \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party has defended Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar, who has landed in controversy after a letter she wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting for dates for visa interviews was leaked in the media. The party has described allegations against her as attempts to tarnish the party’s image by dragging it in a controversy.On Sunday, Manish Jha, RSP’s acting spokesperson, issued a statement expressing the party’s concern over news reports mentioning the Deputy Speaker.The statement noted that the matter, “which was already known to the Federal Parliament Secretariat and other high-ranking officials,” has been unnecessarily publicised.“We want to assure everyone that RSP will remain steadfast in its commitment to promoting good governance, social justice, and rapid economic development for Nepal, undeterred by false attacks aimed at tarnishing the party’s image with malicious intent,” Jha said in the statement.The Deputy Speaker has become embroiled in controversy after a letter she wrote to the US Embassy on February 26, 2023, requesting visa interviews for herself and five others was leaked. She had written to the consular general at the Embassy of the United States in Kathmandu to arrange interview dates for six people including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter.Rana wrote that as they were attending the 67th session of Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York on March 6 to 17, 2023, she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. She is now being criticised for misusing her position to make undiplomatic requests to the individuals not even related to parliament secretariat. Deputy Speaker is also ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council that recommends heads and members of constitutional bodies and chief justice.Experts and retired parliamentary officials have criticised her also for corresponding with diplomatic agencies without informing the parliament secretariat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Jha’s statement said the party conducted an immediate inquiry after receiving information on the matter.“It was found that the individuals did not leave the country and there is no evidence of any financial transactions,” the statement read.The statement however has added that RSP supports an impartial investigation by the authorised agencies to determine whether the Deputy Speaker and other leaders breached diplomatic protocols.The RSP has also alleged that the controversy surrounding the Deputy Speaker is a conspiracy hatched by the new ruling coalition.  \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nKathmandu Metropolitan City continues mosquito breeding ground destruction drive to control dengue spread, with 1,268 cases reported since January 2023.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City trained doctors and paramedics in mental health screening to provide timely treatment for prevalent mental health issues in the city, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.\nDespite initial skepticism, Kathmandu's independent mayor and party-affiliated deputy mayor have maintained cordial relations, highlighted by the deputy mayor's recent criticism of the mayor's controversial remarks and his \"lone-wolf\" leadership style.\nMG Motor India is introducing an array of five new vehicles, including electric and hybrid models, in collaboration with JSW Group, with the MG Cloud EV electric MPV expected to debut in the festive season.\nNICCI met with Nepal's Energy Minister to discuss attracting foreign investment, project development, and capacity enhancement in the energy sector, focusing on export opportunities through Indian transmission lines and addressing project completion challenges.\nNepal's ten industrial districts face challenges of infrastructure, regulation, and political instability, impeding private sector growth and foreign investment, despite government efforts to establish new industrial areas.\nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has alerted all agencies concerned to the risk of a Nipah virus outbreak in Nepal, as neighbouring India recently reported a death from the deadly disease.Officials said they have purchased reagents to test the virus and laboratory technicians have been trained to test samples of suspected cases.“We are aware of the Nipah virus outbreak in India and the deaths,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, chief of the Zoonotic and Other Communicable Disease Control Section. “We are closely monitoring the development and have alerted our relevant agencies to the looming risk.”India has reported an outbreak of the Nipah virus in the state of Kerala and the death of a 14-year-old boy from the infection on Sunday. An additional 60 people who came in close contact with the deceased have been identified as a high-risk group by local health authorities, according to media reports.This is the fifth outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala since 2018, according to media reports. Last year too, health authorities in India confirmed at least two deaths and three other cases of the viral infection, including a child, in the southern Indian state.Nipah is a zoonotic virus, transmitted from animals to humans, and causes a lethal swelling of the brain in humans. Transmission generally occurs when people come in close contact with infected animals or through the consumption of the meat of infected animals, according to doctors. The World Health Organisation has classified the Nipah virus as a priority pathogen due to its potential to trigger an epidemic.Transmission generally occurs when people come in direct contact with infected animals—pigs, fruit bats or through consumption of contaminated foods and meat of infected animals, according to health officials. Doctors say cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus have also been reported in many places, including in India, among the families and caregivers of the infected people.Health officials said no treatment for the Nipah virus is available. Without a vaccine having been developed, health workers provide symptomatic treatments only. “We have alerted all our sentinel sites across the country to the risks,” said Ojha. “Health workers are requested to send samples of the suspects for lab testing.”Doctors say Nepal is at risk of an outbreak of the Nipah virus, as fruit bats, which are the primary hosts of the virus, might also be present there. The Nipah virus was first detected in 1999 after farmers and others who came in close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore developed severe respiratory problems and inflammation in the brain.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 300 people were diagnosed with the disease then, and more than 100 of them died.Experts said that authorities should take the issue seriously as the virus is far deadlier than the coronavirus, with up to 75 percent death rate in humans. “The virus is much more infectious and deadlier than other respiratory viruses currently in circulation,” Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, told the Post. “Even if the primary hosts of the virus are fruit bats and pigs, this virus is transmitted from human to human through secretion and excretion. The authorities must step up surveillance.”Doctors say that fruit bats from India, which carry the Nipah virus, can easily enter Nepal due to the proximity and similar environments. Moreover, due to the free movement of people between the two countries, there is always a high chance of any disease seen in India entering Nepal.The incubation period of Nipah infection is 4 to 14 days, and its symptoms include fever, headache, convulsions, and respiratory and neurological problems.The World Health Organisation said that although the virus has caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals and causes severe disease and death in people, making it a public health concern. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population on Tuesday confirmed a cholera outbreak in Thaiba of Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district. A patient with severe diarrhoea tested positive for cholera, officials said.“A lab report confirmed cholera in a diarrhoea patient,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesperson of the Health Ministry. “Stool samples of other diarrheal patients have also been collected for testing.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Officials at the Health Office, Lalitpur told the Post that several people have been infected in a suspected cholera outbreak in the “Drug-Free Society”, a Thaiba-based drug rehab centre. Rapid diagnostic tests confirmed that at least four residents have cholera.“Out of six samples tested, four came positive for cholera,” an official at the municipality told the Post on condition of anonymity. “One patient, in serious condition with severe diarrhoea, has been admitted to the intensive care unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital.”All four infected people were referred to Sukraraj hospital on Monday by the local health authority. But three of them fled the hospital on Monday night, according to Health Ministry officials. “Three patients, who tested positive in rapid diagnostic tests, escaped through the window of the hospital’s toilet on Monday night,” said spokesperson Budhathoky. “Another patient, whose condition is serious, is being treated in intensive care at the hospital. The patient, who tested positive for cholera, has been admitted to a cabin in the hospital.” Officials said that patients might have fled the hospital to avoid returning to the rehab.Following news of the suspected cholera outbreak, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, the agency responsible for responding to the disease outbreaks, mobilised a team of health workers to the rehab.“Samples of water and stools have been collected from the rehab centre,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. The Kathmandu Valley often witnesses cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season, with hundreds of people suffering from diarrheal infections that continue for months.In May, a 62-year-old man from Makawanpur district, who had been hospitalised with severe diarrhoea, tested positive for the deadly disease. The man is said to have been living in Kathmandu for a long time.In 2022, a total of 77 cases of cholera were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Experts say that a cholera outbreak in the Valley during the monsoon is particularly concerning. Rainwater contaminates most water sources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected with water-borne diseases, including cholera. Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main drivers of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. According to the World Health Organisation, a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.A combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nIn a bid to determine the serotypes of the dengue virus from past and current infections, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has been preparing national guidelines.Officials hope that the new guidelines will require relevant agencies to regularly serotype the deadly virus. Serotypes mean different versions of a virus that can be identified by differences in their proteins.“We have been carrying out serotyping of dengue virus on an ad hoc basis,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We can expect serotyping of dengue virus on a regular basis once new guidelines are enforced.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the division, at least 1,657 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 196, followed by Jhapa with 128, Chitwan with 92, Makawanpur with 73, Okhaldhunga with 57, Tanahun with 56, Bhojpur with 52, and Doti 50 cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. There are five serotypes of dengue, numbered 1 through 5.Nepal has reported four serotypes of dengue virus—DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4. Last year, virus serotypes DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 were found responsible for the dengue epidemic in the country. At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Entomologists say that regular serotyping of the dengue virus is important. Pathological investigation of the deadly virus helps differentiate the serotypes of past and current infections, which will ultimately help make people aware of the risks.“People who were infected with one serotype of the dengue virus will not get infected from the same serotype immediately,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “But the risk of severity will be high if he/she is infected with different serotypes. Concerned authorities can tell the people about the serotypes spreading in their communities.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. They say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe Indian links of some US presidential election contenders probably mean little additional benefit for ties, experts said, against the backdrop of bipartisan support for closer relations with the South Asian nation to counter an assertive China.Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Usha Chilukuri Vance, the wife of Republican Donald Trump’s running-mate, have rarely visited the birthplace of one or both of their parents, although Indians take pride in their success.“Either way, from India’s perspective, whether it is Republican or Democrat, that relationship enjoys bipartisan support and should not be affected,” said Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a former Indian ambassador to the United States.“It can only benefit,” he said of the India links, adding, “(It) cannot be affected adversely.”Since ties with New Delhi are viewed favourably by both parties in Washington, there will be little impact on relations, regardless of which party wins, or the candidate’s Indian roots, an Indian government official said on condition of anonymity.Both President Joe Biden and Trump, his predecessor in office, sought to woo India, not just to challenge China in the region, but also to wean New Delhi from a traditional dependence on Russian weapons.Role modelBoth Harris and Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential candidate, J.D. Vance have links to southern India. Vance belongs to a family of renowned academics.Harris, who has garnered the backing of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination, is viewed as role model in her mother’s ancestral village of Thulasendrapuram.She has “proven how young women, previously confined to their homes, can reach such heights, becoming a public figure in the world’s No. 1 country,” said J Sudhakar, a resident of the village where Harris’ maternal grandfather was born.“How big an achievement is that?”Harris, who visited the village as a five-year-old, has recalled walks with her grandfather on the beach of the city of Chennai where the family later lived, about 320 km (200 miles) from the village of roughly 2,000 people.But she has not been back since becoming US vice president.“Residents expected a visit, a statement or at least a mention of the village, but that didn’t happen,” said shopkeeper G. Manikandan.“But we will invite her when she wins and organise a grand celebration and welcome for her,” he added. \nSaboteurs struck France’s TGV high-speed train network in a series of pre-dawn attacks that caused chaos on the country’s busiest rail lines ahead of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony on Friday.The coordinated sabotage took place as France rolled out an unprecedented peacetime security operation involving tens of thousands of police and soldiers to lockdown the capital for the Games, sucking in security resources from across the country.The state-owned railway operator said vandals had damaged signal boxes along the lines connecting Paris with cities such as Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Strasbourg in the east. Another attack on the Paris-Marseille line was foiled.Hundreds of thousands of people were left stranded at rail stations.There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But two security sources said initial suspicions fell on hardline leftist militants or environmental activists.“Everything leads us to believe that these were criminal acts,” Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete told reporters at the Gare du Nord.The coordinated strikes on the rail network will feed into a sense of apprehension ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony in the heart of Paris later on Friday.More than 300,000 spectators are expected to line the banks of the River Seine when the athletes parade through the heart of Paris on a flotilla of barges and riverboats, part of an extravagant opening ceremony that will be watched by a global audience of billions.The SNCF urged all travellers to postpone their journeys. Repairs were underway but traffic would be severely disrupted until at least the end of the weekend. Trains were being sent back to their points of departure.The attacks hit signalling installations on the Atlantic, Northern and Eastern high-speed lines with fires set off by explosive devices, the SNCF said.SNCF chief Jean-Pierre Farandou said some 800,000 customers had been impacted ahead of a busy weekend for French holidaymakers. Thousands of rail staff had been deployed to repair the damage.DESTABILISING FRANCE“This attack is not a coincidence, it’s an effort to destabilise France,” Valerie Pecresse, president of the Paris region, told reporters.France is deploying 45,000 police, 10,000 soldiers and 2,000 private security agents to secure the opening ceremony. Snipers will be on rooftops and drones keeping watch from the air.But while the capital is locked down for the opening ceremony, security elsewhere in the country is lighter.Paris 2024 said it was working closely with the SNCF to assess the situation. The attacks will make it tougher for people travelling to Paris from other areas of France.Some teams like the U.S. basketball team are based in Paris and would have travelled on Saturday by train to the northern city of Lille.The Paris police chief said he was beefing up security even further at the capital’s main stations.The stations were packed with passengers. Many were preparing to go off on their summer holidays and some had already been waiting several hours.At the Gare de L’Est, traveller Corinne Lecocq said her train to Strasbourg on the border with Germany had been cancelled.“We’ll take the slow line,” she said. “I’m on holiday so it’s OK, even if it is irritating to be late.”Xavier Hiegel, 39, said he was just trying to get home for the weekend and could not believe that people would want to harm the Olympics.“The Games bring jobs so this really is nonsense. I hope the people responsible will be found and punished,” he said. \nMexican drug lord Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and the son of his former partner, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, were arrested on Thursday in El Paso, Texas, in a major coup for US authorities that may also reshape the Mexican criminal landscape.Zambada is one of the most consequential traffickers in Mexico’s history and co-founded the Sinaloa Cartel with El Chapo, who was extradited to the United States in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison.Both Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of El Chapo, face multiple charges in the US for funnelling huge quantities of drugs to US streets, including fentanyl, which has surged to become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45.Zambada, who is believed to be in his 70s, and Guzman Lopez, who is in his 30s, were detained after landing in a private plane in El Paso, two US officials told Reuters.Guzman Lopez is one of four sons of El Chapo known as Los Chapitos, or Little Chapos, who inherited their father’s faction of the Sinaloa Cartel. His brother, Ovidio Guzman, was arrested last year and extradited to the United States.In recent years, the Sinaloa Cartel has become the biggest target for US authorities, who have accused the crime syndicate of being the biggest supplier of fentanyl to the United States.Zambada and Guzman Lopez face multiple charges in the US “for heading the Cartel’s criminal operations, including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.The arrest of Guzman Lopez was first reported by Reuters, ahead of the Justice Department statement where it was confirmed they were detained in El Paso.The US authorities had a $15 million reward for Zambada’s capture, while Guzman Lopez had a $5 million bounty on his head.The Sinaloa cartel traffics drugs to more than 50 countries around the globe and is one of the two most powerful organized crime groups in Mexico, according to US authorities.Zambada and El Chapo’s sons belong to two different generations of traffickers, with differing styles.Zambada is known for being an “old-school” narco, avoiding the limelight and operating in the shadows. El Chapo’s sons, by contrast, have a reputation for being flashy narcos who courted attention as they ascended the rank of the cartel.El Chapo’s sons are also known to be more violent and hot-headed than Zambada, who had a reputation as a shrewd operator.Zambada and El Chapo’s sons have had a fractious relationship since their father was extradited in 2017, and the arrests of Zambada and Guzman Lopez may trigger instability or even violence in their heartlands in the northern state of Sinaloa.Their arrests were part of a joint operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agencies, two US officials said.US authorities have over the past year launched fresh indictments against Zambada and Guzman’s sons on new charges in the United States that focus on fentanyl smuggling, as well as the flow of precursor chemicals to the illicit labs operated by their crime syndicate.Over decades, the cartel has set up sophisticated supply chains to move drugs across the globe and to source heavily regulated chemicals to their home base in Sinaloa.Earlier in the day on Thursday, Reuters published an investigation that revealed how fentanyl precursor chemicals are astonishingly easy and cheap to buy online from Chinese sellers that ship the substances door-to-door in North America.“Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable,” Garland added. \nPresident Joe Biden said on Wednesday he had pulled out of the race against Republican Donald Trump because of his concerns about the future of the country, his first public remarks since his abrupt departure from the 2024 campaign.In an Oval Office address, Biden invoked previous presidents Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln as he described his love for the office that he will leave in six months, capping a half century in public office.“I revere this office,” Biden said. “But I love my country more.”Biden, 81, rebuffed weeks of pressure from Democrats to step aside after a disastrous debate performance on June 27, saying at one point that only the “Lord Almighty” could convince him to go. He spent days soul-searching and agonizing over internal polling that showed he could lose to Trump in November and drag down fellow Democrats with him before stepping aside.“I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,” Biden said.Biden sprinkled his 11-minute speech with references to the danger he believes Americans face if Trump wins the November 5 election, without mentioning Trump’s name.He said he was departing from the race to help heal the wounds in the Democratic Party and unite Democrats in the goal of winning.“Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition,” he said.“The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America – lies in your hands,” Biden said.It was Biden’s first extended public remarks since he relented to pressure from fellow Democrats and announced on Sunday via social media that he had decided not to seek reelection on November 5.Out of camera sight during the speech were several members of Biden’s close-knit family, and senior advisers, seated along the curved Oval Office wall. They erupted into applause when Biden completed his remarks.Toward the end of his remarks, Ashley Biden reached for the hand of her mother, first lady Jill Biden, who was seated next to her.Biden is the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since 1968 when Lyndon Johnson, under fire for his handling of the Vietnam War, abruptly pulled out of the campaign on March 31.Biden also joins James K Polk, James Buchanan, Rutherford B. Hayes, Calvin Coolidge and Harry Truman as presidents who all decided not to stand for a second elected term.Biden faced immediate calls to step aside after his rocky performance in the debate against Trump raised troubling questions about his mental acuity.Since he stepped aside, however, Democrats have rallied around him, paying tribute to his character and his record as president.“Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter, from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,” Biden said. “But here I am.”A crowd of staff members walked into the White House earlier in the evening to watch the speech together. Huge cheers and applause came from those who assembled in the White House Rose Garden to hear Biden speak after his address. Ice cream was servedThe White House has denied that Biden has any cognitive issues despite a recent increase in verbal slip-ups.Biden said he will focus on his job as president over his remaining six months in office. He pledged to help make NATO stronger and more united, stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from taking over Ukraine, work toward a ceasefire deal in Gaza and push for Supreme Court reform. He is to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to discuss efforts to negotiate a Gaza ceasefire.It was the fourth time Biden used the formal setting of the Oval Office since taking office in 2021. His last Oval Office speech was on July 15 when he urged Americans to cool the political rhetoric after the attempted assassination of Trump.Biden’s political career began when he was elected to the Senate in 1972 at age 29, becoming the sixth youngest US senator. He will conclude his White House tenure on January 20, 2025, as the oldest American president when he will have already turned 82.“The defense of democracy is more important than any title,” Biden said. “I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It’s about you. Your families. Your futures. It’s about ‘We the People.’” \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \n“I am going to attend NGO CSW67 Forum in New York, NY, USA. Which is going to held from 6th March to 17th March 2023 in New York.” Thus began the by-now infamous letter by the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Indira Rana, to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting an early visa interview date. The missive itself was addressed to “The counselor General” at the embassy, seemingly a position that exists at the American embassy here but is unknown anywhere else in the world.I will not rush to condemn Deputy Speaker Rana for what, in one extreme, has even been called a form of human trafficking, not especially having read about her life when she had been elevated to the august office. Perhaps it was only a serious lapse in judgement?For me, the bigger crime was the letter itself. What followed the excerpt above was even more cringeworthy. That got me thinking about an interaction I had in a private chat group some weeks back. A Nepali woman who had reached a somewhat prestigious position in an international organisation had posted the following on social media: “I’m honored to serve another term as a President of XX Family Network with esteemed volunteers worldwide. It was pleasure to welcome Mr. YY, President of XX and the honorary president of XX Family Network...”My off-the-cuff comment in the group was that while it was great Nepalis were reaching high places, it was “just annoying that she could not get simple grammar right. An Indian would never have let that pass”. Unlike Indira Rana, who went to a Nepali-medium school and who could be excused for coming up with such a hash of a letter, the above entry was by someone with a convent-school background. The least she should have been capable of is the proper use of the indefinite and definite articles—“a” and “the”. In just that one fragment of a sentence, there are four grammatical errors, with three having to do with her wrong use or non-use of articles.Some years ago, a desk editor friend at an English newspaper said he spent nearly all his time fixing, as he called it, the “is-are” in the copy handed to him. He was expressing his frustration with stories filed by reporters without any idea about subject-verb agreement, i.e., using the correct verb to match the subject of the sentence. Considering that conjugation of verbs is generally quite simple in English, determined as it is mainly by the subject’s being singular or plural, one wonders why despite decades of English-medium, private school education, the quality of English among Nepalis remains so abysmal.I believe the answer lies in the English-language textbooks students go through in their school life. I mean such books as produced in Nepal. In our times, we had to study books published in India, the same as those used in English schools there and without doubt of a quality that contributes to the facility with which Indians use the language.Things began to change in Nepal in the mid-1980s. Indian publishers were still supplying textbooks to Nepal, albeit with tweaks such as Guided English for India being renamed Guided English for Nepal. But there was a market they could not fulfil. If I am not mistaken, Nepali publishers began their foray into English-language textbooks with social studies after there was a backlash from parents complaining about their children learning the history and geography of India. I was a schoolteacher back then, and I remember how atrocious those books were. Unfortunately, not much has changed. In fact, the situation has become worse, with the textbook market having spawned many new publishers, churning out stuff on all subjects that is almost criminal in content given the errors being drilled into our students.A youngster I know has just entered Class XI to study physical science. Since language proficiency is possible only when used correctly in all contexts, and also out of plain curiosity, I had a look at his books. The following howlers have been taken from the very first paragraphs of the texts he will be reading for the next year. A mathematics book dealing with elementary logic started with this: “Critical and rigorous thinking are necessary for the clear understanding of a subject in all areas. The ideas emerged can be communicated in speech or writing in sentences.” If only the communication had been both grammatically and linguistically correct.And, there was this ostentatious start to a physics book: “The branch of science which deals with the study of natural phenomenon is called physics. To understand physics, we must be able to connect our theoretical description of nature with experimental observations. Such connection is made through quantitative measurements…The process of comparing an unknown physical quantity with a known fixed quantity is called the measurement. The quantity used as a standard of measurement is called the unit.” Apart from the unnecessary use of the definite article in the last two sentences and the absence of the indefinite ones in the preceding ones and at least one other error I could spot, this is written well enough but what a boring read.The same was true for another physics book that began thus: “Just what is Physics? Physics deals with the understanding of natural phenomena. It is a science based on experimental observation. All of the ideas presented in this book were not found in a cave or brought to use by aliens; in fact, they were discovered by real people engaged to find a solution to a problem of life.” One understands where the authors are going but…Given the changed times, the chemistry textbook cited here could easily have used a female as an example (after having corrected the language): “The student who works on the chemistry laboratory should always be realized about the importance of general direction of working in the chemistry laboratory. It is advised that he should always follows these rules with the attention and care they deserve and ultimately they will help him to add to his credit not only in his examination but in his later life as well.”A numerical chemistry book began with numbers and so I went to the preface: “It’s our pleasure to bring this ‘Integrated Numerical Chemistry’ book to you all. This book covers numerical problems that students of 11th and 12th grade need to know so that they can excel in exam…In market it is not difficult to find many other numerical Chemistry books.”Of course, all of these books have been, as some proudly declared, “Approved by Curriculum Development Centre (CDC), Nepal” (with the definite article before “Curriculum Development Centre” invariably missing). And, I have not even started on other aspects of book production that these publishers seem to have no idea about. There were unnecessary indents while indents were missing where required. The spacing between lines was inconsistent. None of the books I went through had used “smart quotes”, those squiggly things that are a pleasure to behold compared to the \"straight ones\". Neither was there any uniformity in the style or size of the font within the same book. The printing and paper used was terrible in some of the books, particularly those produced by the government, rendering page and page quite unreadable.If such is the material being used to educate our children in expensive private schools, I should say, Indira Rana did not do that badly with her letter. After all, as the saying goes: Garbage in, garbage out. \nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Nepal polio-free in 2014 after the country maintained the status for three consecutive years. Nevertheless, a few days back, the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) announced the re-emergence of the poliovirus, prompting preparations for a polio vaccination drive in Kathmandu. Although the virus was found in sewage/river water samples rather than clinical samples, it raises a grave concern regarding public health threats in Nepal. Polio is a highly infectious but vaccine-preventable viral disease primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route. It can also spread through contaminated water and food. Symptoms usually become visible seven to 10 days after exposure but can range from four to 35 days. The maximum excretion of the virus can be observed two to three days before the onset of symptoms and one week after the symptoms appear. There are three poliovirus strains: Wild poliovirus type-1 (WPV-1), wild poliovirus type-2 (WPV-2) and wild poliovirus type-3 (WPV-3). Fever, fatigue, vomiting, headache, stiff neck and limb pain are the initial symptoms which usually last for about a week. Up to 90 percent of infected individuals show mild or no symptoms. A small proportion of cases develop irreversible paralysis, usually of the lower limbs. Of these (paralysed patients), five to 10 percent die due to respiratory failure. Serology tests, cell cultures and polymerase chain reactions (PCR) are laboratory methods to identify the virus. As per available information, samples found in the sewage of Kathmandu were sent to Bangkok for laboratory testing to confirm the virus. The genetic sequencing method can help identify mutations in the virus and their origin. Presently, the source of the poliovirus detected in Nepal remains unknown. No specific anti-viral medicine is available for poliovirus and treatment is mainly supportive. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is widely used worldwide, including in Nepal. It contains live, weakened poliovirus, which replicates in the body of the vaccinated child and spreads to others when the child excretes. If such a weakened virus circulates for an extended period in the community, it can be mutated and cause paralysis in an unvaccinated infected patient. Poliovirus mutated from the original strains (in the OPV) is known as vaccine-derived poliovirus. The OPV contains a combination of up to three strains of live poliovirus. Nepal had switched to bivalent OPV from trivalent OPV on April 17, 2016. The bivalent OPV (bOPV) vaccine contains types 1 and 3 weakened polioviruses, protecting against poliovirus types 1 and 3. The virus currently detected in Kathmandu is said to be vaccine-derived poliovirus type-3, meaning this virus may have escaped from bOPV or circulated for a long time. Interestingly, Israel also reported vaccine-derived poliovirus type-3 in March 2022. However, it is not clear if there is any relationship between Israeli and Nepali polioviruses. Moreover, without genetic sequencing analysis, it is not possible to firmly establish Israel as the country of origin of the Nepali poliovirus.Nepal experienced multiple waves of measles outbreaks in 2023. The reasons behind these unusual outbreaks remain unknown and have not been investigated; the potential explanation could be the interruption of childhood immunisation programmes due to fear of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) transmission (during the pandemic). In fact, I had predicted and warned about the possibility of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in children in the absence of a regular immunisation programme owing to Covid-19 waves. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on poliovirus needs to be explored to understand its shifting clinical nature and genetic coding. There are ample studies published about post-impact of Covid-19 waves on non-communicable diseases, for example, post-Covid syndrome. However, little is known about the immune system and its reaction to infectious diseases following Covid-19 waves.Several countries, such as India (type-1), the UK (type-2), the US (type-2), Indonesia (type-2) and Israel (type-3) have reported circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses during the same year (2022), meaning that these mutated strains of polioviruses emerged in a similar time-period following multiple waves of Covid-19 worldwide. It seems that the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses could happen anywhere and anytime in the days to come. This sparks a grave concern because vaccine-derived poliovirus can also behave like wild-type viruses, cause outbreaks and lead to paralytic presentations in unvaccinated individuals. For instance, Indonesia reported acute flaccid paralysis cases in two patients (a six-year-old female and a one-year-old male) after they were infected with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type-2. Many researchers believe that low vaccination coverage and the weakened virus from OPV spreading among under-immunised populations foster conditions conducive to the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses in the community. At present, the origin of vaccine-derived poliovirus detected in the sewage of Kathmandu is not clear. Vaccine-derived poliovirus type-3 detected (as per media report) in Kathmandu due to the circulating of the weakened virus from OPV among the under-immunised population could be a plausible explanation, as Nepal is currently using a bivalent polio vaccine (bOPV) in its immunisation programme that contained poliovirus type-1 and type-3. As of now, the emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus may not pose a significant health risk for the community. Nonetheless, the persistent detection of these mutated viruses within the community or in outbreak situations can pose significant public health challenges in Nepal and around the world. Thus, maintaining surveillance and adherence to vaccination in children is important to sustain Nepal’s polio eradication status.  \nFederalism, republicanism, secularism, inclusiveness and the rule of law are key pillars of Nepal's constitution. Disrupting even one of these pillars jeopardises the constitution and risks plunging the country into conflict. The provincial level symbolises federalism, but it faces significant criticism. The provincial structure was introduced to address the Madhesh Movement and the Maoist insurgency. However, this change has not been widely accepted, leading to calls for eliminating the provincial structure altogether.The institutionalisation of provinces has been hampered and neglected not only by the federal government but also by leaders from key political parties. The constitution grants exclusive and shared rights to the provinces, requiring the authorities to make laws, form annual budgets and decisions, and formulate and implement policies and plans. The provinces, however, began with no prior experience, leading to a prolonged period of trial and error. This has resulted in unfair criticism and calls for the abolition of provinces. Systemic delaysThe federal government's delay in enacting the Federal Civil Service Law has led to a chaotic personnel administration system in the provinces. While provinces have issued the civil service acts, the federal recognition of promotions remains inconsistent. Federal employees assigned to provinces often rest unmotivated and disconnected from local needs. This undermines provincial governance as these employees are less responsive to provincial authorities. A similar issue exists in the education sector. The School Education Bill in Parliament lacks clear national standards for school education and has bypassed the exclusive right of the local level.The federal government is introducing new bills related to universities, but my concern lies in constitutional grants that give provinces the right to establish provincial universities. While provinces are establishing universities, the federal government is simultaneously introducing its own university bills. When I was a member of Parliament, I argued that the higher education bill and education policy should be prioritised, and only then can universities be established. However, I received no support from my colleagues. Many assert that the provincial structure has become expensive and burdensome. However, provincial expenditures constitute only 10 percent of the total expenditures across federal, provincial and local levels. How can a structure spending merely 10 out of 100 rupees be deemed burdensome?Federal government ministries have withheld and spent budgets meant for the provinces indiscriminately. For instance, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure has a budget of Rs150 billion, while the Ministry of Urban Development has around 100 billion. Some ministries have budgets as high as Rs250 billion. In contrast, the combined budget of all seven provinces for FY 2024-25 is only Rs279 billion. Meanwhile, the ministers of the Physical Infrastructure and Urban Development Ministries together control budgets larger than those of all seven provinces combined. This discrepancy highlights the centralised control over resources that should be allocated to provinces.The matter of sizeThe constitution considers provinces to be the key pillars of development. However, many federal ministries have retained small-scale programmes and projects that should fall under provincial jurisdiction. Despite this, if the provincial structure is considered cumbersome, we can reduce the number of provincial ministers. Similarly, reducing the number of provincial members is also necessary. However, streamlining federal governance and aligning it with the constitutional spirit requires significantly reducing the number of federal ministers. If we follow the constitutional mandate properly, the budget of federal ministries would go to the sub-federal level.The constitution provides state power to provinces (Article 56) but lacks its own staff, police force, adequate financial resources and land acquisition. During budget preparation and execution, provinces often face a shortage of finance secretaries and staff. The annual report of the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) indicates a shortage of 11,000 employees in the provinces. Reports from constitutional commissions, including the OAG, reveal federal government’s non-cooperation with sub-federal levels and interference in policy formulation, budget implementation and personnel management.Provinces have been hindered by political mismanagement, federal centralisation and inadequate intergovernmental relations. To realise the potential of federalism, it is crucial to decentralise authority, improve cooperation, and support provinces in their development journey. Only through these reforms can Nepal's provinces become effective and autonomous entities within the federal system. By addressing the challenges of origin, acceptance, duplication of efforts and fiscal mismanagement, provinces can enhance their effectiveness and contribute to the overall federal system.Reforming the systemSeveral reforms are necessary to empower and strengthen provinces. The federal government must respect constitutional provisions and allow the provinces to manage their police, staff, and other key areas independently. There is a need to organise regular meetings and functional mechanisms for cooperation, coexistence and coordination among federal, provincial and local governments. National standards across all government levels should be developed and enforced to ensure uniformity in services and goods provided.Political leaders' attitudes towards provinces remain unenthusiastic. Chief ministers cannot act independently and need party leaders' consent even for minor decisions. For provinces to function effectively, political parties must align their structures with the provincial system. Provincial committees should be empowered, and accountability systems should be established, linking the federal government to the central committee, the provincial governments to the province committees, and the local government to the district committee. However, considering the international practice of province management and the centralised thinking of Nepal's political parties, these improvements seem unlikely.During Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's tenure, provinces could still not utilise police powers. Chief ministers' voices are often unheard due to provincial instability. They have also been neglected and bypassed in the fiscal transfer system. For instance, in FY 2018-19, provinces received Rs123 billion in grants from the Government of Nepal. Although the budget increased by Rs500 billion over six years, the grant amount to provinces in FY 2024-25 decreased to Rs96 billion—27 billion less than six years ago.Reforms for stability Provinces can effectively lobby the federal government only when they are stable. This requires constitutional amendments through electoral system reforms. Provinces include a mixed electoral system like the federal Parliament, and the proportional electoral system should be abolished in favour of the first-past-the-post system with ensured proportional and inclusive representation. This would require ensuring seats for women, Dalits, tribals, Muslims, and backward classes within the direct election system. This method will decrease the number of provincial assembly members and likely result in one or two parties gaining a majority. Alternatively, a directly elected chief ministerial system, with accountability to the provincial Assembly and requiring a two-thirds majority for removal, can also provide stability.Additionally, reforming the number of provincial ministers is necessary. Limiting ministers to 10 percent of provincial assembly members, with a minimum of five, is a viable option. Most countries, whether at federal or provincial levels, have limited numbers of ministers. For instance, the Swiss constitution mandates just seven federal ministers, including the president. Reducing the number of federal ministries and aligning provincial governance structures with constitutional provisions are crucial steps in strengthening Nepal's federal system and ensuring effective provincial governance. \nNepal, a country that was long in the clutches of poliovirus, made a significant stride when in 2014 the United Nations declared it “polio-free”. However, the recent detection of type-3 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV)—active viruses in the oral polio vaccine—in Kathmandu’s sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers indicates a potential outbreak. Although no one has been infected, the presence of the virus in sewage is in itself concerning. This calls for a prompt response from the authorities, as it could put Nepal’s achievements on polio at risk. According to the World Health Organisation, polio or poliomyelitis mainly affects children under five (but anyone unvaccinated is at risk). It is a water-borne disease and is transmitted through unhygienic habits, droplets or aerosols, faecal contamination, infected utensils, food and water. Infection from the virus has declined (by 99 percent) worldwide since 1988, but the WHO warns that “as long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk”. South Asian countries Pakistan and Afghanistan have also reported wild polio in wastewater in recent months. This means the risk of contagion in Nepal is far from over, and we can no longer be complacent. The emergence of VDPVs, as per the WHO and studies, is associated with low immunisation coverage. Vaccination is thus crucial to contain the spread of polio. Nepal has undertaken many vaccine campaigns against it. Still, as per the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, at least 4 percent of children aged 12-23 months have not been jabbed against any disease. The vaccine coverage rate for polio, according to the Health Ministry, is 95 throughout the country. So, the virus could strike under-vaccinated and unvaccinated children at any time. For successful eradication of the poliovirus back in 2014, the country’s efforts included routine vaccine campaigns, door-to-door calls, additional national and subnational mass vaccination campaigns, surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis, mop-up campaigns, and the introduction of injected vaccines in addition to oral vaccines. It’s time the government and healthcare authorities dusted off their old knowledge and kits. However, studies show that vaccines alone don’t help. A recent article, “Polio in Gaza: What Does This Mean For the Region and the World?” in The Conversation highlights how maintaining sanitation and hygiene can help eradicate polio.Health authorities and donor agencies have arranged special vaccination drives in Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur and are launching the campaign from today, and it will continue till July 27. They must ensure that not a single child is deprived or missed and also focus on virus surveillance in other districts and start jabbing children wherever necessary. Despite this initiative, a recent Post report highlights a significant disparity in the country’s approach to sample collection: They are taken from five tributary rivers in the Kathmandu Valley, Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces; other provinces are excluded. This isn’t comprehensive enough as poliovirus could be detected anywhere, given the constant flow of people, in and out of the country.The situation demands that the government develop country-wide monitoring, vaccination campaigns and sanitation programmes without further ado. If these measures are not prioritised, it could be a matter of time before we have another polio wave on our hands.   \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli secured a resounding majority in the House of Representatives on Sunday. Getting 188 votes in the 275-strong chamber, Oli showed the backing of over two-thirds members of the lower house. This in itself is a positive start to a new stint as prime minister for Oli. A powerful government is in the interest of the country that has been reeling under economic crisis, unemployment and other problems. However, securing an overwhelming House majority at the start of the term is nothing new for a Nepali prime minister. CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who secured over 97 percent votes in the House in January 2023, had to go for the floor test three more times before he was ousted earlier this month. In the fourth vote, he was supported by only 22 percent of the members of the same House.When KP Sharma Oli became prime minister for the second time in February 2018, he returned to Singhadurbar with a strong mandate as the erstwhile left alliance of the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) won a resounding majority in the 2017 general elections. In May the same year, they converted the left alliance into a single unified party making Oli a strong prime minister, commanding an overwhelming majority in the federal parliament. But this unified force fell apart and the two mother parties were revived in March 2021. When the Supreme Court in July 2021 ousted Oli, the UML chair lost not only the trust of other parties but also the support of many lawmakers from his own party. These are just a few instances. If history is any guide, securing a big parliamentary majority at the start means little if cannot be protected for any length of time. The goal should rather be to use this strength for the benefit of the country’s larger good.The country needs a strong government and political stability—more specifically, policy consistency. The government in place in turn urgently needs to address pressing issues—prolonged economic stagnation, slow development activities, unemployment, brain drain, corruption. But the mother of all problems is the protracted economic crisis. So the top priority should be to fix the economy. This done, many other things will fall into place.Prime Minister Oli is praised not only by his party comrades but also the rivals for his bold decision making capacity. But he is also often accused of bulldozing others’ views. This is also why in 2021 he irked many leaders within his party as well as chiefs of other political forces and lost their support. Oli’s statements after becoming prime minister last week suggest a change. The remarks he has made in the House on domestic as well as foreign relations are more balanced this time. The prime minister must not forget that the support of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the House of Representatives, has made it possible for him to return to power with a strong parliamentary support. His relations, mainly with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, is going to be crucial. Just as was the case during his previous tenures, Oli’s success this time will depend on whether he can accommodate other viewpoints, both from in and out of the ruling coalition. This, unfortunately, has not always been his strong suit.  \nThe accusations of abuse of authority and accepting kickbacks that have been levelled against Deputy Speaker of the federal parliament Indira Rana Magar are not easy to dismiss. Rana Magar recently came into controversy after a letter she wrote to the American Embassy in Kathmandu, urging the embassy to expedite visa dates for some people, came to light. In the letter dated 26 February 2023, she has asked the consular general at the embassy to arrange visa dates for six people, including herself. The other five are Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung. The communication was made on the official letterhead of the House of Representatives. The letter says the six were attending the 67th session of Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023, and she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. In normal course, the Parliament Secretariat makes such requests on behalf of the speaker and deputy speaker via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. What is even more unusual is that Rana Magar admits that she knew only one of the other five people mentioned in the letter. Some media reports have also published material suggesting that the deputy speaker accepted money in return for lobbying for visa dates. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which nominated her to the state position, has denounced her ‘media trial’ and an attempt at ‘character assassination’. In her own defence, Rana Magar has put out a statement saying that she wrote the letter “out of compassion” for the grassroots folks who would otherwise never get to go abroad. These arguments are difficult to buy. It is inappropriate for a deputy speaker to recommend complete strangers for a programme to which they are not even remotely connected. Another problem is that Rana Magar has been changing her statements. For instance, when the controversy first surfaced, she said she had signed no such letter. Later, she admitted to signing and sending it. Both Rana Magar and the RSP have questioned why the letter, written a year and a half ago, has been made public now. They say it is aimed at removing Rana Magar from the Constitutional Council. (Deputy Speaker is an ex-officio member of the council that recommends chiefs and members of constitutional bodies). Perhaps. Yet the RSP does not have a plausible explanation for why it did nothing even though the letter came to the notice of its top officials at least three months ago.There are a few indubitable facts. One, there is no doubt that Rana Magar wrote that letter. Two, in doing so, she abused her authority. As far as accusations of monetary exchanges are concerned, they are a matter of investigation. Any way you see it, this issue calls for a thorough parliamentary investigation. Someone in Rana Magar’s position does not have the luxury of making such ‘innocent’ mistakes—or even what little prestige that remains of the state’s high offices will quickly vanish. If there was a criminal motive, the implications of a high-ranking state official engaging in human trafficking are worse still. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nIn the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be Partly to generally cloudy on Friday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of Bagmati, Gandaki, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province as well as in a few districts of other Provinces.
