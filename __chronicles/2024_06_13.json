Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nIn February 1984, Maciej Berbeka and Maciej Pawlikowski of Poland became the first people to climb Cho Oyu, the sixth-highest mountain in the world, from the Nepal side.The mountain, which straddles the Nepal-China border, lies 20 km west of Everest. The 8,201-metre peak was first scaled in winter from the southeast pillar. The caravan route was Kathmandu-Lukla-Namce-Gokyo and Cho Oyu base camp.After three years, in May 1987, Ang Phuri Sherpa became the first Nepali to reach the peak from the Nepal side. It was in spring. Then a group of Russian climbers summited the peak in the autumn of 1991, followed by two Japanese in 1994.The last time Cho Oyu was conquered was in the spring of 2009, when Denis Urubko and Boris Dedeshko of Kazakhstan reached its top. After a decade and a half, a seven-member Sherpa team, including a French national, reached the summit last week. Cho Oyu is considered one of the most accessible 8,000ers from the Chinese side, while the Nepal side is considered among the toughest.Only 21 people have reached Cho Oyu from Nepal’s side in the past 70 years. By contrast, more than 4,000 have successfully climbed the mountain from the Tibetan side. This makes Cho Oyo the second most climbed eight-thousander after Everest.Among the 8,000ers, Cho Oyu has the lowest death rate.On June 7, the French Alasdair McKenzie, with Gelje, Tenging Gyaljen and other sherpas, stood atop Cho Oyu at 8:35 pm via the southwest ridge. The caravan route was Kathmandu-Lukla-Namche-Thame and Cho Oyu base camp.Unlike past expeditions, last week’s climb was meant to prepare a permanent route for a commercial expedition from the Nepal side.“With this success, Cho Oyu has become more accessible from Nepal, heralding a new era in Nepali mountaineering and inspiring future expeditions to tackle its challenging routes,” said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks, the agency which explored the local route. Nepal boasts of eight of the 14 highest peaks over 8,000m on the planet. They are Everest, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, Cho Oyu and Annapurna. But to climb Cho Oyu, climbers usually had to go to Tibet first.“From now onwards, commercial expeditions will happen from the Nepal side. This is good news for all expedition agencies. Climbers will no longer need to go through a long process of getting permission from the Tibetan authority. All eight mountains above 8,000 are now accessible from the Nepal side,” said Mingma.Last Friday, the team started the summit push at 2:00 am from Camp IV, and after a relentless effort of over 18 hours, they made it to the top. “This remarkable achievement was the result of a meticulously planned expedition that started in March and commenced in the first week of May from Lukla,” said Mingma.According to Mingma, a commercial expedition on Cho Oyu may last 60 days and could cost a foreigner between $25,000 and $30,000.“That’s obviously a welcome development. It will create more jobs on the mountain,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. “But it’s too early to say whether the route will be a commercial success,” he said. For instance, the operating cost incurred from the Nepali side is nearly double that from the Tibetan side, in addition to the challenges a vertical wall poses.Transporting goods from Kathmandu to the Cho Oyu base camp would cost $5 per kg. However, as the road reaches the advanced base camp or camp above the base camp of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side, the cost on that route would be $2 per kg.“There is a lot of difference in the operating costs. Climbing from the Tibetan side would cost $13,000 a person,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa. “So, obviously, the climber's preference would be the Tibetan side. First due to the lower factor, and, second, it’s an easier climb from the north.”The success of the new route will depend on its commercial feasibility.Mingma said Cho Oyu’s Nepal side is known for its steep, vertical walls rising thousands of metres, making it one of the greatest present-day challenges. He, however, said once the route becomes commercial, competition will bring down the cost.“More than that, foreigners do not need to wait weeks or even months for the Tibetan authority’s permit to climb.”The story of the first expedition, from the Tibetan side, however, is more interesting.According to the archive of Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, Cho Oyu was first chosen for an expedition in 1952 in preparation for an Everest ascent the following year.The first attempt of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side was made by a British party led by Eric Shipton, with Edmund Hillary, George Lowe, Charles Evans, and Tom Bourdilon as its members. However, technical difficulties at an ice cliff above 6,650m forced them to give up the climb.According to the archive, the expedition, led by the British Eric Shipton, was estimated to take two weeks. “It would also mean entering the Tibetan territory, which it is believed Shipton was unwilling to do,” according to the archive.It was Shipton who first measured Cho Oyu as the sixth-highest mountain in the world.An Austrian expedition, led by Herbert Tichy, arrived in Birgunj in 1954 via India and flew into Kathmandu on an Indian airliner of the time. Once they were packed and ready, they moved to Bhaktapur, from where the long trek to the mountain would begin.There were only three foreign climbers and eleven sherpas on the team.Cho Oyu was finally climbed on October 19, 1954, via the northwest ridge in Tibet by Tichy, Joseph Jöchler and Pasang Dawa Lama.Before Cho Oyu, Everest and Annapurna in Nepal, and Nanga Parbat in Pakistan had been climbed. \nThe ruling and opposition parties might appear divided as they relentlessly attack each other on different issues, but when it comes to criticising the decisions of Sumana Shrestha, the minister for education, science, and technology, they have one voice.Shortly after taking charge of the ministry, Shrestha started a process of taking action against the teachers and professors involved in party politics. The ministry has sought information on the teachers and professors affiliated to the parties from the Election Commission and the respective district education units.The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017 which prohibits the teachers, professors and other government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that school teachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from the state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics. The major parties have disapproved of Shrestha’s move as a large number of teachers are their cadres. For instance, as many as 263 of the 4,743 representatives to the Nepali Congress general convention held in December 2021 were school teachers and staff. The number is above five percent of the total delegates.The main opposition CPN-UML also had dozens of teachers as representatives in its 10th general congress held in November that year. Hundreds of school teachers are associated with the CPN (Maoist Centre) as well.Leaders from all these parties have criticised the move directly or indirectly. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel said the principals of many best-performing community schools were affiliated to different parties.“It is unnecessary to test teachers’ DNA. Let them work,” he said, implying that there was no need to probe whether the teachers are affiliated to a political party.Another factor antagonising the major parties is Shrestha’s decision to make public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission— more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli.On June 7, she made public the report that Oli and his successors had for years kept under wraps. The government was under the pressure of private schools to keep the report a secret as it envisions converting the schools registered as companies into trusts within 10 years. Converting the existing schools into trusts would mean they will be barred from taking profits home. Several cross-party leaders have investments in private schools.Oli was so annoyed by Minister Shrestha’s decision to make the report public that he resorted to making personal remarks about her nationality and marital status without naming her.Now the teachers’ unions of various parties have united against her. The ministry on May 27 endorsed a directive guiding teachers’ transfers. The directive came amid allegations that teachers are being transferred without fulfilling the due procedure. The directive is accused of encroaching on the authority of the School Management Committee and increasing the ministry’s role in transfers. “Your good education is meaningless if you are doing more harm than good to the education sector,” said Shankar Adhikari, chair of the teacher association close to the Maoist Centre, referring to Shrestha’s foreign degree. “She has a shallow understanding of Nepal's education sector.”Leaders of other teacher associations have asked the minister to reverse the directive, warning of the consequences of not doing so. “The directive was issued with the mala fide intent of troubling teachers. This is unacceptable,” said Gyanedra Rawal of the Nepal Teachers’ Union, the Congress teachers’ wing.Some lawmakers and education experts, however, have supported minister Shrestha, saying she is on the right track to improve the country's education sector. Addressing the lower house meeting on Wednesday, independent lawmaker Amresh Kumar Singh said he fully supports the education minister, who is making the necessary intervention. “The education minister is taking the right course. Her works need to be appreciated,” he said.Those who have followed Shrestha’s work also praise her. “She [Shrestha] is eager to bring about vital changes, mainly in school education,” said Usha Jha, a former member of the National Planning Commission.However, many officials at the ministry are unhappy with her work. While she is dedicated to her job, she has a habit of not listening to others, they allege. “The minister thinks she knows everything and is not accommodative. This is the reason her decisions are dragged into controversy,” said a senior official at the ministry. “A minister is a team leader who has to take all the staff along. But that is not the case now.” \nTwo Nepali nationals sustained minor injuries while three others are safe following a devastating fire in a residential building in Kuwait, the Nepali Embassy in Kuwait said. The injured have been identified as Shiv Shankar Paswan and Dorje Lama.At least 49 people have died in the fire in a building housing foreign workers, media reports said. Kuwait's deputy prime minister, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Saud Al-Sabah, blamed property owners for violations that contribute towards such incidents, a Reuters report said. Of the 49 dead, 40 were Indian nationals, according to some Indian media reports. Local authorities have not disclosed the nationalities of the casualties.Nepali Ambassador to Kuwait, Ghanshyam Lamsal, told the Post over the phone that five Nepali nationals were living in that ill-fated building. “Two others had left the building early in the morning and are safe,” Lamsal said after visiting the two injured Nepali in the hospital. The five Nepalis living in the building have been identified as Dorje Lama of Jhapa, and Shiv Shankar Paswan, Dinesh Kumar Mandal, Santos Kumar Goti and Jakir Nadap of Siraha district. One Nepali national escaped the inferno without injuries.“Only two Nepalis were injured and are currently undergoing treatment in a local hospital. They are out of danger,” said Lamsal.A team of embassy officials, supported by local authorities, met with the injured Nepalis.They told officials that they lived on the second floor of the building. When the fire broke out from the ground floor, two descended behind the building using a rope. Another Nepali national was on the ground floor and managed to escape as soon as the fire broke out. Two Nepali nationals were away at work, according to Lamsal.“We spoke with several Nepali nationals as well as those living in that particular building. We learnt that only a few Nepalis were living in that building, so we believe it is unlikely that any Nepalis have died,” said Lamsal.“A rescue operation is going on so we do not have details about the incident and casualties,” he said, adding, “By tomorrow, we will have more details.” \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel, who left for a weeklong visit to Switzerland and Germany on Tuesday evening, reached Geneva on Wednesday.He had a meeting with President of the Swiss Confederation Viola Amherd. They discussed issues of bilateral interest. Paudel said Nepal is in need of more foreign aid as it is set to graduate to a developing country in 2026. In response, the Swiss president said her government was ready to provide all the support needed, according to Kiran Pokharel, the press adviser to the President.Earlier, Nepali Ambassador to Switzerland Ram Prasad Subedi, and embassy officials welcomed President Paudel and his entourage at Geneva Airport.The President and his delegation left Kathmandu for Qatar on Tuesday on their way to Geneva. They reached Doha on Tuesday evening, where they were welcomed by Nepali Ambassador to Qatar Naresh Bikram Dhakal and other officials.After a couple of hours of layover at Doha airport, the President and his delegation left for Geneva.According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, President Paudel will attend the inaugural forum of the Global Coalition for Social Justice, slated to coincide with the high-level segment of the 112th session of the International Labour Organisation.Paudel is scheduled to address the forum on Thursday.On Saturday, the President and the Nepali delegation will leave for Berlin, Germany. Paudel is scheduled to hold a meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Monday evening. \nA meeting of the ‘Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase’ in Bangladesh on Tuesday approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. The proposal was put forth by the Power Division of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).It was one of the 15 proposals endorsed by the Cabinet Committee chaired by Finance Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali of Bangladesh, according to the National News Agency of Bangladesh.Secretary of the Cabinet Division (Coordination and Reform) Md Mahmudul Hossain Khan of Bangladesh told reporters that following a proposal from the Power Division, the BPDP would import 40MW hydroelectricity for five years from Nepal under a tripartite agreement between the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited (NVVN) India, and the BPDB, the report said.Bangladeshi media reports said the power will be traded at 8.17 Bangladeshi Taka, (about Rs9.30) per unit.The delivery point will be a 400kV substation at Muzaffarpur in India, and Bangladesh will pay the transmission charge for using the Indian transmission infrastructure.The date of final agreement between Nepal and Bangladesh on the matter has yet to be finalised. However, it will most likely take place during Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s potential Nepal visit, according to Khan.Nepal and Bangladesh had agreed to sign a tripartite agreement involving the NEA, the BPDP and the NVVN during the meeting of the energy secretary-level joint steering committee in May 2023.Earlier in February, Bangladesh had sent a draft request for proposal (RfP) in response to which Nepal had proposed the tariff. Besides tariff, Nepal had also included details on how Nepal would deliver power to Bangladesh.The two countries agreed on the trading amount on the sidelines of the SAARC Energy Centre’s secretary-level meeting held in Singapore from February 23 to 26, 2024. \nNepal and Sri Lanka shared a point each after heavy rain in Florida and waterlogged outfield at the Central Broward Stadium in Lauderhill led to the abandonment of their T20 World Cup Group D match on Tuesday.The outcome means Group D leaders South Africa became the first team in the 20-team tournament to progress to the Super Eight stage. The Proteas are unbeaten and have won all three matches they have played. They have six points from three games.The result also leaves former champions Sri Lanka without a win after three games and puts the Lankans on the brink of elimination from group stage. Sri Lanka lost their opening games to South Africa and Bangladesh. They face the Netherlands in Gros Islet in their final group game on Monday but may find themselves already out of the tournament by then.Nepal lost to the Dutch in their opening game and sit in the fourth position with one point. But they still have a chance to progress to the Super Eight if they win both of their remaining matches. They play against South Africa on Saturday and Bangladesh on Monday.Bangladesh and the Netherlands are tied on two points but the Tigers occupy the second spot due to net run rate. Both of them have two matches in hand. \nTorrential rains often signal the onset of the early monsoon month of Asar. But when it rains money on roads and project sites, we may consider that, too, to be a sign of the month’s onset. Each year, as the fiscal year enters the eleventh month, government agencies and contractors wake up from their slumber and pull up their socks to either make payments or work for the payments received. Last-minute capital spending repeats each financial year, exposing the inefficiency with which Nepal’s development sector operates. This model of “development” has a nomenclature of its own—Asarey Vikaas. Thanks to the Asarey Vikas model, the roads that were bumpy until last night would have turned smooth and shiny this morning. Roads often become the sites for the manifestation of such an ill-planned model of development, leaving even the locals who have learnt not to expect anything from the government surprised at the sudden transformation of their roads. After all, the government has money to spend, and contractors have work to finish to claim that money. But such hurried spending has a major problem: The work being done is substandard. The road that was blacktopped overnight to meet the spending deadline of this financial year will hardly last until the end of the next financial year. Between June 10 and July 15, 2020, the capital spending jumped by 17 percent in the last month of the fiscal year as the government rushed to increase such expenditure. Before the rush, the capital expenditure had been just 30 percent in the first 11 months of that fiscal year. In FY 2020/21, the government spent 21 percent of the total budget in a single month, between mid-June and mid-July. As of June 12, a little over a month before the end of FY 2023/24, capital expenditure was a mere 44 percent, which means that the government has failed to spend the budget allocated, making it difficult to meet the development targets. Experts blame bureaucratic red tape for the delay in capital expenditure, as it takes months for even small amounts of bills to be cleared. Moreover, projects are often initiated randomly without ensuring the financial resources, leading to failure to move them forward. Previous governments tried to address the problem through budget implementation guidelines. Last year, the government made it mandatory to complete the call for bids and contract signing of projects by mid-November and begin work within 15 days of the signing. It said the plans and programmes that failed to meet this deadline would not get any budget. The 81-point budget implementation guideline has specific provisions on project completion timeline, payment, budget transfers and other matters of financial discipline. The government cannot maintain a lacklustre attitude when it comes to capital expenditure, as it has a detrimental effect on the country’s overall development. It is time to streamline the monitoring, evaluation and payment systems to ensure that the government’s plans and programmes move forward and are completed within the stipulated deadline. The last-minute spending rush should become a thing of the past—which will also be a solid proof of the government’s commitment to improving people’s lives through judicious spending.  \nThe Constitution of Nepal defines health as a fundamental right, stating that every citizen is entitled to free basic health services. However, due to high costs, over half a million Nepalis are deprived of primary healthcare. The country has 7,221 public health facilities, including 125 hospitals, 205 primary health care centres, 395 ayurvedic hospitals, 3,870 health posts and 2,626 community health centres and private health institutions. Despite this wide healthcare structure, the system still struggles to provide accessible and affordable healthcare services to the entire population. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that poverty increases by 2 percent every year due to high out-of-pocket expenditure (OOP) on health services from the private sector. In Nepal, the OOP constitutes 57.7 percent of the current health expenditure, while the government’s share is only 22.6 percent. Nepal has introduced schemes such as the Social Security Fund, the Employee Provident Fund, and the National Health Insurance Programme (NHIP), as well as enterprise private insurance, free healthcare, conditional cash transfer programmes, and improvised citizen programmes to reduce OOP and improve accessibility. However, the effectiveness of these schemes still remains in question. An appropriate pre-financing mechanism is needed to reduce the uncertainty of health illness and the catastrophic cost associated with healthcare. Nepal Government introduced the National Insurance Programme in 2016 to comply with the constitution and work towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030, a vital aspect of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UHC ensures access to quality healthcare without financial hardships. The target of SDG8 has two indicators: Coverage of essential healthcare services and financial protection for all. Low insurance coverageThe NHIP was designed to offer quality care at a minimal cost, guided by legal and policy frameworks to achieve the UHC. It was initially piloted in three districts—Kailali, Baglung and Illam. Despite a favourable policy environment, coverage and retention are not up to the mark, with only 23 percent enrollment and a significant dropout of 25 percent, which is a serious concern. Coverage is uneven, with Koshi province achieving 42 percent coverage while Madhesh lags at 8 percent. The programme also inadequately covers only 26 out of 77 districts of ultra-poor citizens. Although the NHIP aims to cover the nationwide population by 2030, numerous challenges lie ahead.The NHIP faces several barriers, including epidemiological and geographical limitations, limited risk pooling, stagnant financing, lack of financial sustainability assessment, difficulty in seeking referral services, inadequate local-level empanelment of health facilities, limited digitalisation of the NHIP functions and insufficient government ownership. To improve the NHIP and move towards universal healthcare, Nepal can learn about successful health insurance programmes of other countries. Lessons from elsewhereEvery country has a different insurance system to achieve universal healthcare goals. Japan uses a single-payer system where the government is the sole payer for healthcare services. By centralising the payment through the government, Japan has control over healthcare costs and maintains high standards of care. It is designed to provide universal health coverage and ensure accessibility of healthcare services to all people. Singapore uses a hybrid system where individual responsibility is balanced with government support. This approach aims to provide comprehensive coverage while maintaining sustainability and encouraging accountability in healthcare expenditures. Rwanda’s community-based health insurance programme mandates participation, particularly targeting rural and poor populations. The premium rates are progressive, i.e., based on income levels, ensuring the poorer individual pays less. Thailand has significantly improved health insurance coverage through contributions from civil servants and voluntary participation from those in the informal sector. Civil servants contribute to the system as part of their employment benefits, and for those in the informal sector, voluntary schemes are available, encouraging broader participation. This mixed approach helps to expand coverage and promotes universal health coverage. The United Kingdom has a publicly funded health system that provides medical services to the entire population regardless of socioeconomic status. Nepal can learn from the benefits of a tax-funded system, which offers preventive, promotive and curative health coverage. RecommendationsThe provision of health insurance is in its early stages in Nepal, so revising the benefits package to make it more comprehensive and focusing on enrolling underserved populations in Karnali, Sudurpaschim and Madhesh is essential. Instituting mobile clinics, community-based initiatives and strategic infrastructure development can help overcome geographical barriers and provide equitable healthcare services. Developing a sustainability roadmap, exploring innovative financing mechanisms and increasing healthcare spending should be emphasised to meet international benchmarks. Digitalising NHIP activities can improve efficiency, transparency and service delivery. National surveys to determine the coverage gap are vital in assessing the drop-out rate and increasing sustainability. Strengthening the NHIP is crucial for Nepal’s goal of achieving universal health care. Addressing the identified challenges and implementing proposed recommendations can enhance the NHIP’s effectiveness, ensuring equitable access to quality healthcare. Addressing disparities in health outcomes and financing mechanisms is also crucial to improving overall population health and ensuring everyone has access to quality healthcare. Improving worker training and supervision and prioritising service provider education, quality assurance, and preventive care could strengthen NHIP care. Enhancing rural healthcare accessibility is also necessary for health insurance. The government has increased the budget for the insurance programme, but its share of total health sector spending remains low compared to international benchmarks. The World Health Organization predicts that allocating 5 to 6 percent of GDP or 10 percent of the national budget towards healthcare will effectively cap out-of-pocket expenses. Despite this, Nepal consistently allocates below 5 percent of its national budget to healthcare. Increased funding in the healthcare system should be highly prioritised for the successful implementation of the NHIP.Sustainability issues can be addressed through social health insurance contributions and public-private partnerships. Continuous training and skill development for healthcare personnel can improve the quality of care. Performance-based payments can incentivise healthcare facilities to improve quality and efficiency. Using a mix of different funding methods instead of relying on just one is essential for providing universal healthcare and affordable healthcare services. A national health financing system should ensure every citizen can access healthcare when needed and protect families from financial catastrophe by covering out-of-pocket expenditures. Comprehensive governance and regulatory reform strategies are required to improve the scope, accessibility, quality, and sustainability of national health insurance coverage.  \nThey are everywhere. Sweeping floors in the homes of the wealthy, serving tea at stands, begging outside shopping malls, cleaning car windshields, working in brick kilns, and tilling the soil.Pakistan has several pieces of legislation that deal with child labour and yet millions of children are exploited and put to work in full view of the rest of us. It is estimated that Pakistan has over 12 million children who are victims of child labour.According to data compiled in 2021, the vast majority of these children are working in the agricultural sector, helping with planting and harvesting wheat and cotton. They also work in the deep sea fishing and poultry sectors. In the industrial sector, they make glass bangles, amongst other occupations. Other hazardous occupations, sometimes claiming their health and life, are coal and gemstone mining.Around 1.5m are forced to beg, while thousands are exploited as sex workers. These are damning, but not shocking, facts. There is no one in Pakistan who does not encounter small children working around them every single day. We have many laws that pretend to address the problem, but the fact that almost none of them are enforced reveals that there is widespread public acceptance of children being put to work. This is a reprehensible situation and a moral indictment of an entire country.In this atmosphere of apathy and disinterest in making things better, a few grassroots activists are trying to make a difference in the lives of these poor and exploited children. One such activist is a woman farmer called Shagufta Yasmeen.According to Shagufta, when children come to work in the fields, they are often harvesting wheat or cotton. This brings the children into contact with very strong and harmful pesticides that are being sprayed on the crop. Shagufta works with the EU-funded Clear Cotton Project, which is trying to raise awareness about the need to reduce child labour in the cotton fields and especially about the harms of pesticide exposure to children whose brains and bodies are still developing. Long-term exposure to pesticides has also been known to cause cancer and other debilitating conditions in children.In her report published in The Guardian last August, journalist Zofeen T Ebrahim asked, “How many more poor child workers must die in Pakistan before change happens?” It is a good question that has still not been answered almost a year later.In the report, the journalist recounts the death of 10-year-old Fatima Furiro who was found dead in a mansion in Khairpur. Her tortured body was later exhumed for autopsy. Furiro had been sent by her parents to work in the home of Pir Asad Ali Shah Jeelani. The postmortem confirmed that the little domestic worker had been tortured, raped and abused over a protracted period of time. Videos showing an injured Fatima struggling to sit up before collapsing went viral.Of all the child workers whose childhood and innocence are trashed when they are sent to work, little girls working in domestic settings are perhaps the most vulnerable. Educated and wealthy members of society, who otherwise espouse a great commitment to charity and to being good Muslims, regularly ignore the exploitation of these little girls, even though it takes place under their very noses every single day. Because these girls work in private spaces in the homes of people, they can easily be physically and sexually abused without any consequences for the perpetrator.In other cases, these little girl workers who are barely 10 or 11 years old themselves are employed as caregivers for small babies. As wealthy mothers’ shop, chat with friends, and eat at fancy restaurants these little girls trail them like slaves who are indentured to serve and cannot expect any just or fair treatment. Nearly everyone in cities like Karachi and Lahore has seen these little girls sitting on the side or the floor while the rest of the family enjoys a fancy meal without even thinking of feeding them.It is just this sort of dehumanisation, perpetrated by the well-educated and wealthy, that allows child labour to continue unchecked in the country. The reason that legislation, whose ostensible purpose is to end child labour and protect our young ones from the kind of brutality inflicted on little Fatima Furiro, is not implemented is because, in this land of inequality, there is no accountability of the wealthy and influential, who are, in fact, given a free pass after every atrocity they commit. When everyone thinks that exceptions can be made in the prohibition of child labour, tacit acceptance is created in society for this scourge: the children of the poor are seen as fair game when it comes to wanting things done very cheaply.The persistence of child labour and child exploitation in Pakistan is a moral issue. Despite all the commitments to goodness and charity and being faithful Muslims, people simply do not think that exploiting children is a condemnable act. This is why, even as we see children being beaten up, forced into begging, and kicked around in front of our very own eyes we do not raise our voices or punish the culprits.This extends to law enforcement and other government institutions that, too, look the other way when they should be catching and imprisoning the perpetrators, however rich and powerful.Everyone likes to condemn evil practices in theory but then they stay quiet and are, in fact, complicit in their perpetuation. Collectively, this is a moral indictment of an entire country, and reveals a deep ethical bankruptcy that sees little wrong in the failure to protect the most helpless and vulnerable in society.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nWhen it arrives, it can bring both bounty and bane. However, due to a changing climate, monsoons in recent times have invariably resulted in more hardship than help. This monsoon, which arrived in Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual date, will certainly buoy farmers and provide much-needed relief from the blistering heat, but concerns over its severity still loom large. Experts have predicted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures. As this will exacerbate floods, landslides and epidemics, disaster preparedness becomes crucial.Our responses to natural disasters have consistently fallen short. Governments come and go, but the same pattern repeats every year, and hundreds of lives, and a whole lot of properties and physical infrastructure are left at nature’s mercy. Not that the country has no plans and policies for disaster preparedness. This year, as in previous ones, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has devised the Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan, which is commendable. The necessary logistics and emergency relief materials have also been stockpiled in all provinces, according to officials. The problem, however, is with the execution of these plans. This monsoon is estimated to put 1.81 million people and 412,000 households at risk, and require 18,000 rescues. These numbers are large, suggesting the necessity for a comprehensive response to disasters and ensuring that relief programmes reach the most vulnerable and needy. Lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels has also caused several problems during disasters. Local governments play a big role as primary rescuers in floods and landslides, but they are still far short in human and financial resources. The examples from the earthquake-devastated Rukum West, Sindhupalchowk and several other places highlight how Nepal fails to rehabilitate the disaster-displaced people for long periods. The residents of Rukum West are still obliged to live in houses with cracks and fissures, and experts warn that these houses could be badly damaged this monsoon. There is also high risk to those living in high landslide and flood prone areas. Unless we design approaches that include not only immediate relief programmes but also year-round relocation, rehabilitation, monitoring and study, people will continue to suffer. Also, proactive measures like public awareness and early warning should be strengthened.Moreover, monsoons are notorious for water- and vector-borne diseases, including dengue, cholera and typhoid. Dengue cases are already being reported from different parts of the country and the caseload will likely increase during and after the monsoon. Water resource contamination has surged in the past few months, leading to a higher number of water-borne disease cases in hospitals. During the monsoon preparedness, the authorities shouldn’t overlook these epidemics and focus particularly on areas that are more prone to diseases and, therefore, need timely healthcare intervention and workers.A coordinated effort from health, home, urban development and water supply ministries can help make this monsoon a lot safer. In the long run, we should find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, which has exacerbated our climatic conditions and intensified disasters. Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on weather will help us better prepare for future monsoons and the disasters that come in their wake.  \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel highlighted the importance of social justice for inclusive economic development on Thursday.Addressing the inaugural forum of the Global Coalition for Social Justice of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, Paudel said that sustainable peace could be achieved through shared prosperity, further urging the international community to mobilise resources to realise the same.“A significant amount of money that should be spent on development is being invested in deadly weapons. The international community should reverse this path and mobilise resources for the prosperity of humanity,” the President said. “Sustainable peace can be achieved through shared prosperity and a sense of global brotherhood, not through weapons.”President Paudel also reflected on the importance of adapting to new workplace challenges and the need for peace to underpin development.Nepal has embraced new challenges such as the digital economy, care economy and gig economy and is committed to implementing the ‘Decent Work Agenda’, he said.“For that, we must prepare ourselves for new jobs, learn new skills, and adapt to new workplaces.” The President is currently on a weeklong visit to Switzerland and Germany. He and his delegation reached Geneva via Qatar on Tuesday.On Wednesday, he met with President of the Swiss Confederation Viola Amherd and discussed issues of bilateral interest.On Saturday, the President and the Nepali delegation will leave for Berlin, Germany. Paudel is scheduled to hold a meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Monday evening. \nThe Special Court handed a sentence of six years to a Lumbini Development Trust employee for corruption on Thursday.A bench of Special Court Chairperson Tek Narayan Kunwar, comprising members Tej Narayan Singh Rai and Ritendra Thapa, convicted the trust’s engineer Saroj Bhattarai for illegally accumulating personal wealth on June 6. On Thursday, he was handed the jail term and a fine of Rs8 million in the case by the court.The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority had filed a case at the Special Court accusing Bhattarai of corruption, on April 7.Among other charges, the corruption watchdog accused him of taking a bribe of Rs8 million from businessman Safik Ahmed, who is the proprietor of one of the construction companies contracted with the trust, through a third person.Ahmed was awarded a contract worth Rs1.22 billion during Bhattarai’s tenure as the trust’s head of the planning section in 2018/19.Bhattari used the amount to buy two different pieces of land, spanning over 2 ropani 9ana and 2ana and 1paisa respectively, in Gundu of Bhaktapur in his mother Janak Nandini Bhattarai’s name.The mother, who was also a defendant in the case, was acquitted of the charges. \nWeeks of scarce rainfall in parts of China, coupled with sweltering heat, has brought drought to several provinces, prompting alerts and actions from authorities to minimise impacts on agriculture, and water and energy supplies.Temperatures this week are forecast to scale record highs in parts of China as countries across Asia brace themselves for another summer of extreme weather.China's Water Resources Ministry this week launched emergency responses to manage drought on in Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces, indicating various regions in the country spanning the northwest to the east are facing parched and scorching conditions.With dwindling precipitation since May in areas around the Yellow River Basin, in combination with the onset of searing temperatures this month, drought is threatening cultivated land that were being prepared to be sown as well as sown crops, Xinhua reported.The harsh weather conditions will feature until the end of next week, with drought expected to worsen, the official media said.In some parts of Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces, temperatures could reach 44 degrees Celsius (111.2 degrees Fahrenheit), potentially breaking historical records for the month of June, state broadcaster CCTV said.Surface temperatures could hit 70 C in some localities including in Shanxi and Shaanxi, it added.The emergency management ministry has alerted affected regions including northwestern Shaanxi, northern Hebei and Shanxi, eastern Anhui and Shandong as well as central Henan to protect water and food production.China's national forecaster predicted continuous heat wave conditions and warned about the need to prepare for emergency power supplies as well as fire prevention in forest areas, the People's Daily reported.Electricity demand typically soars in high temperatures as people crank up the air-conditioning to stay cool.Rain, not heat, is the threat in southern China. Coastal Fujian's provincial observatory raised a warning for wet weather and potential disasters after forecasting heavy rainfall until Saturday. \n Group of Seven (G7) leaders start their annual summit on Thursday looking to double down on support for Ukraine in its war with Russia and offer a united face in confronting China’s political and economic ambitions.With the Middle East, migration and artificial intelligence (AI) also on a packed agenda, the June 13-15 summit in southern Italy would be taxing for leaders at the best of times, but most of them are also bowed down by their own domestic woes.US President Joe Biden, facing a tough re-election bid in November, arrived in Italy the day after his son Hunter Biden was convicted of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak appears destined to lose power in a July 4 election, the leaders of France and Germany are reeling from political defeats, and opinion polls are bleak for the prime ministers of Canada and Japan.Only the host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, is riding high after triumphing in Italy’s European election last weekend, but achieving meaningful results in the luxury Borgo Egnazia hotel resort will be a tall order.Determined to claim the initiative, the G7 leaders look likely to announce they have agreed on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from frozen Russian assets to back the multi-year debt package.However officials acknowledge the plan is complex, meaning any deal will only be in principle, with legal experts still having to thrash out the details that will need the backing of European nations, particularly Belgium, which is not in the G7.For a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the summit and is due to sign a new, long-term security accord with Biden.“By signing this we’ll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If (Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he’s wrong,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.Confronting chinaUnderscoring US determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.By announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.The European Commission told automakers on Wednesday it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese electric cars from July, less than a month after Washington quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100%.While G7 leaders are expected to express concern over high Chinese production levels, which they say disrupt global supply chains and market stability, EU diplomats warn that Europe is anxious to avoid a full-blown trade war with Beijing.Eager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including Pope Francis, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on both the risks and potential of AI.Among those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.Although the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a final news conference from Meloni. \nOn Thursday, the weather will be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province, along with the hilly regions of Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province.According to the Metrological Forecasting Division, it will be partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country.It said light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places in Koshi and hilly regions in Bagmati and Gandaki and at one or two places in the rest of the country.Tonight, it will be partly cloudy to generally cloudy in Koshi Province, along with the hilly regions in Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province, and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country.The met office said light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning, and gusty wind is likely to occur at a few places in Koshi and hilly regions in Bagmati and Gandaki and at one or two places in the rest of the country.On Wednesday, Dhangadhi experienced the warmest day in the country, with temperatures rising to 43.9 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature in Jumla was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius. \nCandid and confident, Shreeya Giri founded the digital mental health platform Happy Minds. For this initiative, she was named in the prestigious Forbes magazine’s 30 under 30, 2024 edition, under the social impact category.An advocate of mental health, Giri believes in immersing oneself in the journey of self-betterment. Bonding over judging books by their covers and discussing intriguing mental health reads in an interview with the Post’s Anusha Dhakal, Giri shares her love for the self-help genre and how books helped her grow as a person.What do you recall as the first book you ever read?I started reading after my bachelor’s. My first read was ‘The Path of Least Resistance’, which a close friend gifted me after graduation. My friend knew I was facing dilemmas about what I wanted to do with my life, so this book is special to me because it is so precious that I can't bring myself to let people borrow it.Have you ever come across a book that changed you or impacted you immensely?‘Think Like a Monk’ by Jay Shetty means a lot to me. I brought it back from London during what I recall as the most difficult time. During this period, I was deeply entangled in negative cycles. I would look into the mirror and only see my dark circles, my hair, and my body, and only think about how much I disliked my appearance. I often wondered why people drained me so much and so often.While reading the book, I felt as if it was written for me. It teaches you to reconstruct your thinking into more positive patterns. Another key takeaway for me was the importance of gratitude. It’s easy to be grateful towards nature or God, but we are seldom grateful towards ourselves. After reading this book, I have been practising self-gratitude.I don’t consider myself a religious person because, growing up, religion felt like it demanded faith without explanation. Interestingly, I was introduced to the word “dharma” through this book. I understood that the true purpose of life is to self-love without expectations. Shetty makes an intriguing distinction in the book between a monk’s mind and a monkey's mind. At my lowest point, I had a monkey mind, blaming everyone but myself for my circumstances, which filled me with negative energy. Eventually, I began letting go of such energy.Looking back, all of the suffering and rejections make sense. Without them, I wouldn’t be here at Happy Minds, doing what I do. I know Jay Shetty is a controversial figure, but I believe there’s always something to learn from someone. I am a believer in separating the art from the artist.Do you think storytelling plays a role in healing?It plays a huge role, actually, both personally and collectively. After my Forbes feature, I was invited to give long-form interviews, during which I shared my life experiences with the utmost vulnerability. Organically, through media coverage of my story, more than 120 people signed up for therapy at Happy Minds.This alone is proof that storytelling possesses a unique power to make people feel seen and seek help. Have you ever considered writing a book of your own, perhaps in the self-help genre? As you are more connected to this category.Yes, I have considered it. My friend and I were planning to do so, but I had to drop out due to my poor mental health at the time. She went on to publish a book on feminine energy, which someone stole from the office. Isn’t that amazing? It was so good that someone stole it—what a compliment.If I were to write a book, it would be on psychology and well-being. I have a lot to share about my story. I’ve noticed that telling my story through public speaking and interview formats feels too limiting, so I think I will write a book highlighting my life experiences, which hopefully reaches more people.Is there a book you recommend to your colleagues and clients at Happy Minds?I frequently recommend ‘Maybe You Should Talk to Someone’. However, I couldn’t finish it because it was very triggering. The book, written by a therapist, offers insights into the frameworks therapists use and how they perceive their clients’ opinions and experiences. It’s a very interesting book, revealing the kinds of conversations therapists encounter during therapy sessions.There is a fascinating part in the book where a therapist is conversing with a convicted murderer. In the conversation, it appears that the person committed the act in a brief, emotionally charged moment. As the conversation progresses, it becomes evident that this person is very emotional and intuitive, almost a good person. It might be jarring for some to think about how a murderer could seem good, but the book provides an interesting perspective: that humans are neither wholly good nor wholly bad.I’ve also often contemplated the challenges faced by therapists, particularly their ability to shoulder not only the burdens of their clients but also their own. Does the book discuss how therapists maintain this delicate balance, continuously listening to others while managing their life challenges?It does, actually. Therapists are also people; they carry their past and their traumas. Sometimes, a client’s story can reflect the therapist’s personal experiences or traumas. This raises a question: Are therapists in a position to set boundaries when something like this happens? The book discusses this situation.Therapy has steps, the first of which is assessment, where we examine the client’s case history. This helps us understand the client’s story and expectations. Therapists should recognise that the client’s story is separate from their own.This is why we request a case history at Happy Minds before assigning a client to a therapist. Similarly, having a similar life experience to a client doesn’t mean you shouldn’t see the client.Is there a book that has increased your self-awareness and self-knowledge?‘The Body Keeps the Score’ is a book that has increased my self-knowledge. Through this book, I learnt something that was almost a revelation. This book talks about how your brain, as a defence mechanism, erases your memory post-trauma.This book helps you sit down and self-reflect, reviving your memories by connecting the dots. Hypnotherapy has also been useful in this endeavour. Through this process, I have been able to recover many childhood memories. To be honest, my childhood was not entirely bad, and I can now recollect the good memories as well.Shreeya Giri’s book recommendationsEmbodying Feminine EnergyAuthor: Maria TomanPublisher: Independently publishedYear: 2022‘Embodying Feminine Energy’ is about building yourself as a magnetic force that attracts positivity and exploring best practices for recovering mentally, emotionally, and physically from trauma.The Body Keeps the ScoreAuthor: Bessel Van Der KolkPublisher: Penguin BooksYear: 2014Kolk’s book helps you understand how trauma might be affecting the way you see yourself, respond to experiences, and react to them.

However, the districts of Koshi province have been spared from this scorching weather.Several weather stations, including those at Changunarayan Bhaktapur, Chautara of Sindhupalchok, Tikapur of Kailali, Dharan of Sunsari, and Sarlahi, broke all previous records of maximum temperatures this year.Temperatures exceeding 33 degrees Celsius over the past several days have made life difficult in the Kathmandu valley, with many residents complaining about the heat.On Wednesday, the temperature climbed to 34.3 degrees Celsius in Kathmandu. Met officials said that hot and dry conditions will continue for the next couple of days, as monsoon rains are not expected to arrive in the Valley anytime soon.“Monsoon rain is a must for the Valley to cool down, but it is unlikely to arrive in the next two days,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecasting Division. “Temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius for several days have made the Valley hotter.”According to the Met Department data, the weather station at Changunarayan in Bhaktapur recorded 34.4 degrees Celsius on May 31, the highest temperature ever recorded here. Kathmandu had recorded 36.6 degrees Celsius on May 7, 1989. Tikapur of Kailali recorded 45.2 degrees Celsius on May 30, the highest temperature in the country this year. Likewise, Dharan recorded 40 degrees Celsius on April 28, and Sarlahi recorded 43 degrees Celsius; both are the highest temperatures recorded for those places, according to the Met department.Monsoon clouds entered the country from eastern Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Since then, districts of eastern Nepal have been witnessing rainfall. Met officials say it used to take two days for the monsoon clouds to arrive in the Valley after their arrival in eastern Nepal and around a week to spread throughout the country. However, last year, it took some three weeks for rainfall to occur in western and far-western Nepal.“Due to climate change, the weather has become more unpredictable,” said Manandhar. “The monsoon that entered eastern Nepal two days ago should have reached the Valley by Wednesday, but it may take a few more days.”The Met Office issued a heat wave warning for western and farwestern Tarai following the onset of monsoon. Officials said that they may have to issue more such warnings in the coming days due to the slow progression of the monsoon towards the western parts of the country.“It is not possible to come out in the afternoon due to the extreme heatwave conditions,” Dr Sanket Kumar Risal, information officer at Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, told the Post over the phone. “The hospital is also packed with patients suffering from fever and water-borne diseases. Even groundwater sources are shrinking in our areas. It now takes several hours for the water tank to fill up, which previously took just an hour.” On Wednesday Dhangadhi recorded 43.9 degrees Celsius, followed by Nepalgunj (42.2°C), Birendranagar (41.1 °C), Bhairahawa (40.4 °C), Ghorahi (39.5°C), and Dipayal (40.8 °C). The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. Last year, it started on June 14, one day later than the normal onset day. A normal monsoon, supported by the timely arrival of rain, translates into favourable agricultural production, mainly of paddy, and is further linked with the country’s overall economic growth.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.The Met Office has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events, such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.The department’s climate section has forecast weather conditions for four months (June to September). It said most parts of the country are likely to experience above-average minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall due to weakened El Nino conditions, and the development of La Nina conditions.El Nino conditions are the climatic patterns in which the surface water warms, unusually.The opposite, the cooling of the ocean surface, happens in the La Nina conditions.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average of a rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short time, continuous rain for several days post-monsoon, dry spells and droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal temperatures in winter—have become more frequent in Nepal. \nARIES (March 21-April 19) Self-talk plays a major role in your healing today.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak. \nOn February 7, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government to allow the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding its legal ownership ceiling with plots in any other place within the Koshi Province.With the Supreme Court issuing its full text of the verdict on May 11, opposition party leaders have started questioning the CPN-UML about “policy corruption” committed in the process.The Nepali Congress leaders have demanded a probe into the Oli government’s decision. Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.“No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,” said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill. Some of its lawmakers like Radheshyam Adhikari had criticised it strongly in the Upper House. However, it wasn't objected to by the Congress while endorsing it.Experts say this is an example of how laws are passed in Nepal. The executive includes provisions that allow for policy corruption, and these are endorsed as lawmakers do not care to engage in a thorough study and deliberations over the bill.“Policy corruption at the executive level can be checked if the lawmakers are vigilant and lawmaking is transparent,” Khimlal Devkota, a former National Assembly member who has closely studied Nepal’s law-making process, told the Post.Policy decisions in Nepal have become rather controversial. Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House.Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. “The lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.“The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.”Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process. Talking to law students on Sunday, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri said the government was creating a Suggestion Bank to receive feedback on bills. “Such feedback and suggestions will be incorporated in the bills,” he said. \nThe collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress. In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  \nAfter three years of halt, the much-awaited 5G frequency is set to be auctioned in Nepal.“The telecom regulator is ready to allow 5G frequency, and we are waiting for service providers’ response,” said Pradip Paudyal, deputy director of Nepal Telecommunications Authority.Paudyal, however, didn’t mention the auction date.“We have decided to auction the 5G frequency and are preparing for it,” he said.Paudyal said that to take part in the auction, service providers should clear all the dues they owe to the government.5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology, offers 10 times faster internet speed than its predecessor 4G and supports 10 times more devices per square kilometre.The state-owned phone company has announced several launch dates, but they have always been postponed for no apparent reason.The 5G rollout was originally planned in 2021 but came to an abrupt halt, which insiders said was due to geopolitics.American and Indian embassies’ officials recently told the Post that they were concerned about the Nepal government allowing the Chinese companies to conduct the 5G tests without going through a competitive bidding process.Nepal Telecom has also been saying that there aren’t enough 5G compatible phones in Kathmandu and other cities to warrant launching the new technology. But records show that millions of mobile phones with advanced features have been imported in the past two years.The rollout plan has been revived after the formation of the new government, which, according to insiders, is close to its northern neighbour, China, which has installed and supplied 5G equipment.“We introduced the new frequency policy around four months ago. Under this policy, all frequencies will go into technology neutrality from the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25,” said Paudyal. Technology neutrality allows service providers to use any technology in a given frequency, he said.Currently, there are two telecom service providers operating in the country—Telecom and Ncell.According to the telecom regulator, service providers can introduce 5G technology using existing frequencies or new ones. The authority says it is prepared to provide new frequencies through auction. Nepal Telecom was provided with a 2,600 Mhz frequency for the 5G trial. The authority provided the frequency for a year, and Nepal Telecom conducted an internal trial for around 2-3 months last October. It was said that Nepal Telecom would conduct a trial among the public, but that wasn’t meant to be. The regulator has written to Nepal Telecom to submit a report on the 5G trial.“Once it receives the report, the authority will proceed accordingly,” Paudyal said.While the government said it is ready to introduce 5G technology, the service providers said that since building the 5G ecosystem requires huge investment and as the country’s current economic situation is not so good, the market is not ready for the new mobile technology.It is estimated that service providers need to invest around Rs50-60 billion to implement 5G technology. Both the market and consumers are not ready for the technology, and there are device constraints, too.According to service providers, though mobile phone users’ demands have been growing in Nepal, daily data usage remains very low. Only two out of 10 Nepalis use mobile data regularly, according to Ncell, the private telecom provider.Ncell said in a recent statement that the average monthly data consumption per customer is only 4GB, which is low compared to other neighbouring countries.The telecom service providers are losing money and have outstanding dues due to the reduction in income.When Ncell introduced 4G in 2017, its annual income was Rs58-59 billion, which has now declined to Rs33-35 billion.Similarly, Nepal Telecom’s profit declined to Rs7.8 billion in the last fiscal year from Rs15.01 billion in 2017. According to a report by Cable.co.uk, the mobile data price measured from June to September 2023 is $0.43, or Rs57.38. The average cost of 1GB of data in India is $0.16, $0.12 in Pakistan, $0.23 in Bangladesh, $0.25 in Sri Lanka, $0.71 in Bhutan, and $2.16 in the Maldives. Mobile data prices are expensive in Nepal compared to other South Asian countries.Nepal Telecom concluded the 5G trial in four places in certain mobile sets to check whether the technology supports our network, said Hari Dhakal, spokesperson of Nepal Telecom.“As it requires a huge investment to bring the technology, we need to look at the cost, market readiness, return and other factors. So it will be difficult for us to go to the public immediately and we will not bring it unless we are assured of all the factors.”Jabbor Kayumov, CEO of Ncell, told a recent press meeting that after India, Ncell was looking to make Nepal the first country in South Asia to introduce 5G commercially. “But to get there, we need to take an important first step, and that is we need every Nepali to start using their mobile phones productively which means keeping mobile data always on.”Also, the government needs to create favourable conditions and reform laws to bring the new technology, company insiders say.For instance, a case involving Nepal Telecom and Ncell is under the court’s consideration. The government is forcefully asking telecom service providers to clear the frequency amount before the auction of 2,100 Mhz by bringing retrospective law, insiders say.3G was introduced in Nepal in 2007 and 4G in 2017.After the government announced an ‘economic decade’, digital economy topics are coming to the fore. “For a digital economy, digital transformation is necessary, which in turn calls for 5G technology. This is why the government has prioritised 5G,” Paudyal said. According to the 61st annual report of the Auditor General, Nepal Telecom spent Rs18.43 million for the trial of 5G in the current fiscal year. The audit has suggested that the company needs to be more effective in the implementation of 5G technology. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nSiddhartha Art Gallery felt quite different last Saturday. With the sweltering heat in Kathmandu, you might think it was the glare of the sun, but it was more about the joyful energy of the ‘Nepal Pride Parade’. The gallery, which is usually adorned with huge canvas frames and majestic pieces of art, with paintings from traditional to abstract, had way smaller photo frames lined up. The photo frames looked too simple, with ordinary pictures.One might have speculated whether the photos were captured by skilled professionals or if they were groundbreaking shots taken by daring photographers or investigative journalists, given that they were intended for an exhibition. However, from a single look, it could be seen that the photos were taken by no experts, just ordinary people. Yet, when one looked at them, they couldn’t take their eyes off them, for these photos captured the everyday lives of rural trans women—a group often forgotten and overlooked because of the dominant mainstream focus on the urban, upper-class LGBTQIA+ community.Blue Diamond Society (BDS), a pioneering organisation advocating for sexual and gender minorities in Nepal, organised a two-day photovoice exhibit titled ‘Sweekar’ from June 8 to June 9 at the Siddhartha Art Gallery, Babermahal Revisited, Kathmandu. This exhibit, coinciding with Pride Month and the Nepal Pride Parade, showcased the stories of rural transgender women from Madhesh Province, Nepal. Through 15-20 compelling photographs, selected and narrated by the women themselves, the exhibit provided a glimpse into their lived experiences and the intersectional stigma they face regarding gender identity and HIV healthcare.According to the organisers, ‘Sweekar’, meaning acceptance, is a multi-prong effort to examine and address the intersectional stigma experienced by trans women living in Madhesh Province. Photovoice, a method designed to spark verbal discussions on significant community issues, has been widely utilised in health education. Fifteen trans women were invited to participate in two three-day photovoice workshops in Janakpur. They worked with a trained facilitator to learn how to use photography to share their lived experiences of stigma. In the second workshop, the facilitator reviewed hundreds of photos with the participants and distilled them down to the photos exhibited, which represented the issues most important to trans women.Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society, stated, “This is not a typical photo exhibition to be viewed from an artistic perspective. We are not romanticising the pain and struggles of the trans community. These are their unheard stories and hidden pain. Through this exhibit, we aim to provide a platform for trans women to share their challenges and progress”.True to Dhakal’s sentiment, the photos revealed the lives and struggles of rural trans women in Madhesh. Each photo was accompanied by short quotes from the women, adding depth and meaning. For the first time in my experience at an art gallery, there was no artist's perspective, only the raw, unfiltered voices of the people depicted. One photo showed a trans woman carrying a bag on her head, with a quote, “Heading to India for a performance. Walking because public vehicles wouldn’t let me board.” Another showed a trans woman carrying a milk pot with the quote, “People hesitate to buy milk from me because I'm queer. It’s hard to survive.”Likewise, another photo showed a trans woman in a sari with torn clothes, accompanied by the quote, “When we go to the market, people tear our clothes, they don’t respect us, sometimes they rape.”The phrase “sometimes they rape” was used so casually, yet it starkly depicts the harsh reality faced by trans women, who have become so vulnerable and accustomed to violence like harassment and rape that they speak of it lightly. For me, “sometimes” had always been associated with trivial activities like “sometimes I sing”, “sometimes I go climbing”, or “sometimes I write”, but hearing “sometimes they rape” was shocking and took on a new heavy meaning. Through the photos, the audience could see the vulnerable realities of trans women in rural areas. Even research indicates that rural transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) populations have a greater need for health services compared to their urban counterparts. They face unique barriers to accessing these services, and their health disparities are less researched than those of urban TGD populations.Another study shows that trans women in Nepal are highly stigmatised, leading to factors that increase their risk for HIV. Interventions are needed to support the economic and mental well-being of trans women to mitigate the heightened HIV risk from stigma. However, the healthcare systems and acceptance are lacking.Pinky Gurung, president of BDS, opined, “Through this, we aim to educate the general public, policymakers, and stakeholders about the realities faced by trans women in Nepal and advocate against the anti-gender movement.”The exhibit also featured a video collage of the daily lives of trans women. It showed how trans women are like any other people who wish to have ordinary lives but are forced to endure difficult lives due to societal stigma. It also showcased rare instances where trans women received necessary help and healthcare, offering hope for a more positive and accepting society.The exhibit's standout feature was that the photos were taken by trans women themselves, adding authenticity and a personal connection to their daily lives.The ‘Sweekar’ photovoice exhibit celebrates the achievements of the LGBTQIA+ community and underscores the need for continued action towards inclusivity and better health outcomes for all, especially trans women.Dr Erin Wilson, principal investigator of Sweekar, said, “Through photovoice, a participatory research method promoting critical self-awareness within social contexts, we hope to empower individuals to challenge stereotypes and reduce stigma towards trans women and HIV in Nepal while boosting empowerment and social support.”The exhibit moved to Janakpur on Monday and was presented yesterday at Mithila Yatri Niwas, Janakpur, from 12 pm onwards. Those who missed it in Kathmandu can visit the Sweekar website to view the photos and narrations. \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, is set for its Unity General Convention, which will commence on Monday in Janakpur, a month after the party suffered a split.The federal chair of the JSP-Nepal, Ashok Rai, along with seven federal lawmakers and 30 central committee members, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party.The party split was more visible at the centre, but it is said to have had a lesser impact on Yadav’s faction in the province so far.Party insiders say the dissidents in provincial assemblies and party committees couldn’t get organised to form new committees as the registration of the new party at the election commission was immediately challenged in the Supreme Court. The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit.Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support.Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7.Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation.“The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.”Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari.“Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said.This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections.The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the parties in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990.Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically.The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention.The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April.The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention. The party's foreign affairs department chief, Arjun Thapa, said delegates from India, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Indonesia have already arrived in Nepal.Invitations have been extended to various parties, except the Janata Samajbadi Party led by Ashok Rai, which splintered from the JSP-Nepal. The Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) are other parties that will participate in the Janakpur convention. Party leaders say the opening ceremony will be held on Monday, whereas the closed session, which will discuss the party’s political documents, is scheduled for the subsequent days. \nNepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa has joined the group of leaders calling for a constitutional amendment in order to address the underperforming provincial system and the political instability allegedly caused by the mixed electoral system the country constitutionally endorsed nearly a decade ago. After a change in coalition at the centre began to affect provincial governments, voices for reforming the electoral system through constitutional amendment are growing louder. Speaking at a programme in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, a general secretary of the largest party in the House of Representatives, argued that reforming the electoral system had become necessary to ensure political stability. He also said that the provinces’ performance so far shows that the federal system cannot be sustained in its current form. “By reform in the provincial structure, I do not mean scrapping the federal system altogether, which the country cannot afford,” Thapa told the Post when asked to explain his statement. “The issue of governments’ formation in the provinces has been challenged in court. This is a result of lack of clarity on provincial government formation in the constitution.”The government formation process in Koshi and Gandaki provinces have been challenged multiple times, and the Supreme Court has many times invalidated the chief ministerial appointment and election processes in the two provinces.Questions have been raised over the expenditures for running the provincial governments. “To address this issue, we need to downsize the elected representatives’ bodies not only in the provinces but also at the federal level. For that, we need constitutional reform,” Thapa added. “We bear a collective responsibility to protect and sustain the constitution. This, however, requires some amendments. Reform in the electoral system is as important,” Thapa emphasised. The provinces followed the same process of government formation practised at the centre and that caused problems, he said. Thapa stressed that amendments to the constitution could address all these issues.The Congress leader says it is wrong to advocate either for scrapping the federal system altogether or and fully retaining the constitutional provisions on the provinces. The Rastriya Prajantara Party, which bats for the revival of the Hindu Kingdom, has been demanding the scrapping of the country’s federal structure. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which was formed two years ago, also wants the provincial structure overhauled. The new party says it wants to downsize the middle layer of the federal system. The party hasn’t participated in the provincial elections.Former National Assembly member Khim Lal Devkota, who is also an expert on federalism and a columnist at The Post, sees a slim chance of any changes in the federal system even though “it is necessary”.“I have closely worked with Nepal’s top political leaders. I believe they won’t readily amend the constitution,” Devkota told the Post. “The longer we take to amend the constitution, the more questions there will be on the longevity of the constitution.” During the Congress Mahasamiti meeting held in February, many leaders raised their voices in favour of filling all seats of the lower house of the federal parliament through direct election. Instead of electing a section of the lower house under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, the leaders had suggested that the upper house of the parliament be filled exclusively through the PR system. They were of the view that Nepal would not have a stable government unless all the lower house members were directly elected by their constituencies.Devkota is also of the opinion that Nepal needs to reform the election system. The mixed electoral system should be changed to create an environment for political instability, he said.In the 275-strong federal lower house, 165 are directly elected, whereas 110 come from the PR category. The upper chamber has 59 members. Of them, 56 are chosen through an electoral college comprising provincial assembly members and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units. Each province elects eight members, while three are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.Likewise, among the 550 members in the seven provincial assemblies, 220 are elected under the PR category. This number is large compared to the population size and thus needs to be reduced significantly, say experts.However, Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, blames the political leaders for the current problems of the provinces. Top politicians are using provincial governments and assemblies to place their second- and third-tier leaders. This has burdened the state without yielding any tangible results, he added. Pokharel says this represents a failure of the leadership rather than the federal system.Since the inception of the provincial system, political parties have appointed chief ministers on a rotational basis, Pokharel told the Post. “It is true that there are operational problems in the provinces, but leaders are more responsible for this than the system.” Even though the state structure is federal, political parties have yet to adopt the three-tier system within their organisations, he said. “What stops the political parties from giving autonomy to their provincial committees and letting them make decisions regarding the provinces on their own?” Pokharel questioned.Devkota, however, said two models should be considered to ensure the stability of provincial governments.The first involves distributing the government leadership positions based on the number of seats won in the election, and the second concerns implementing provisions similar to those at the local government level. According to the first model, the chief minister and other positions are distributed based on the number of seats shared in the provincial assembly elections, and the government is run among the constituent parties on a consensus basis.As per the second method, the chief minister is directly elected by voters, similar to the election of mayors or chairs at the local units. This makes the chief ministers fully accountable to the people. The chief minister can be removed by a two-thirds majority of the provincial assembly, thus preventing one from being an autocrat. One of the major concerns is the destabilising linkage of provincial politics with the power equation in Kathmandu. When the coalition at the centre changes, governments in the provinces also change.The subnational governments changed immediately after the change in coalition partners in Kathmandu on March 4. When Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed ruling partners, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, CPN-UML, joined the government while the largest force, the Congress, was ousted from power. The changes at the centre immediately triggered changes in the provinces as well. \nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Technology on Friday made public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli.Unveiling the report that Oli and his successors had kept under wraps was one of Sumana Shrestha's priorities as minister for education, science, and technology. Following her request, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal handed the report to the ministry on Monday.Shrestha consulted the commission members on Thursday. The ministry stated that the report’s recommendations will be implemented under Dahal’s leadership.The statement quoted Shrestha as saying, \"The government will implement positive and contextual suggestions.\"In August 2018, the government formed a 25-member commission led by Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. It involved education experts, representatives from teachers’ and private schools’ associations, and officials in the task of recommending the government on its education policy.The commission prepared the report after rigorous discussions and consultations with the stakeholders. On January 15, 2019, it was submitted to Oli. However, Oli was not interested in implementing the recommendations, so he never made the report public. His successor, Sher Bahadur Deuba, also followed suit.The commission has recommended that private schools be converted into “trusts” within 10 years. This would, according to the commission, stop the commercialisation of education. Conversion into trust means that the school owners cannot distribute their profits. Currently, most of the private schools operate as companies after getting registered in the Company Registrar's Office.The commission, according to its members, made its recommendations based on Article 31(2) of the constitution, which makes the state responsible for ensuring compulsory basic and free secondary education for all. The commission said that leaving private educators to “generate profit”, as they are doing at present, would be tantamount to a breach of the constitution.The private school operators objected to the provision. They had tried to pressure the commission to exclude it as the report was being finalised.Usha Jha, a member of the commission, said there was immense pressure from the private schools to keep the report unpublished.\"We worked really hard to prepare the report. All the recommendations aim to improve the country's education system,\" Jha told the Post. \"The education minister took a bold step to make the report public. I believe it gets implemented. In fact, the minister is already following the spirit of the commission's report.\" As the Oli government kept the report secret, a majority of members of the committee shared it with the media in December 2020. The National Campaign for Education, an umbrella body of over 400 organisations working in the education sector, had printed the report and distributed it at an event.However, the report coming out of the ministry holds a different meaning—that the government owns it, said Jha.The commission recommended that the government facilitate private sector investment in higher education and bring school education gradually under the government’s ambit. It also suggested partnerships between private and public schools to improve the latter’s quality.Hiring head teachers on contract after evaluating their performance, increasing education budget to at least 20 percent of the government’s spending as per its commitment and ensuring that every child gets basic education in his/her mother tongue are other major recommendations of the commission.Despite Nepal’s global commitment, the proportion of the national budget allocated to the education sector has been declining. The share of the education budget, which once amounted to 17 percent, is now down to 11 percent.Allocating at least 20 percent of the national budget, or 6.5 percent of the national GDP, to education is considered the global norm.Several commissions have been formed to recommend educational reforms over the past decades. However, most of the reports remain unimplemented. The Pokharel-led commission was the sixth formed since 1955 and third after the restoration of democracy in 1950 to look into matters concerning education. \nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nNepali Congress lawmakers back Mayor Shah's sidewalk expansion plan, escalating a conflict with UML over federal-local government jurisdictions sparked by Shah's allegations against UML chair Oli in a failed land swap bid.\nBodies of a woman and an unidentified man were discovered at the bottom of a cliff in Dakshinkali, likely victims of a motorcycle accident.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City initiates Sisdole road repairs in preparation for monsoon, aiming to prevent garbage disposal disruptions, considering leachate control measures and source waste segregation.\nA man attempted self-immolation in Kathmandu after allegedly setting his own family on fire on Tuesday.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Keshav Thebe, 55-year-old Chanchal Bahadur Singh, who was in an inebriated state, sprinkled kerosene over his wife Bindu, and their three daughters, aged 24, 16 and eight, and set them on fire in Saraswatinagar of Chabahil.Singh then attempted self-immolation, police said.All of them have been admitted to the Kirtipur Hospital for treatment.The 24-year-old and the teenager have been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as they have sustained 55 percent and 80 percent burns to their bodies, respectively.The others have sustained eight to 10 percent burn wounds, the hospital said. \nIn the first ten months of the fiscal year, Nepal's high-value product exports grew moderately, but concerns arise over the country's readiness for LDC graduation with a focus on value chain development, quality improvement, and export incentives review.\nSuman Pandey, a renowned figure in the travel and adventure industry and the president of Explore Himalaya Travel and Adventure, has been appointed as the new vice chairman of the prestigious Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA).

He said the necessary funds have been allocated for setting up the court. “The government will tackle issues like black-marketing and market syndicates will be controlled. A consumer court will also be set up, and I have allocated a budget for this purpose,” Pun said while presenting the budget.\"We had sought a budget of Rs10 million to establish at least one consumer court in a district inside the Kathmandu Valley. But we have yet to know how much has been allocated. The proposed Rs10 million will cover administrative and employment expenses of the court,\" said an official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, wishing not to be named. \"We aim to establish the court in the coming fiscal year.\"The Consumer Protection Act, 2018 has a provision requiring the government to establish a consumer court. Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies submitted a draft of legislation to the law ministry in September 2019. Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. However, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in the government.Last year, the Industry Ministry cancelled the previous process and started a fresh process by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in an appropriate location within the Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the current condition of the country and available resources, the official said. Based on financial resources, more consumer courts will be set up gradually in other districts also, according to officials.The draft report has been submitted to the Law Ministry, which has forwarded it to Judicial Council for its suggestions.According to the proposed draft, the government, in an effort to minimise the financial burden on state coffers, will deploy the district judge and staffers of the respective district to the consumer court, according to the official. “If there is space in the district court, the consumer court will be established there, or else a separate building will be rented for the purpose,” the official said. In September 2019, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies submitted draft legislation to establish a consumer court to the Ministry of Law, which then forwarded it to the Judicial Council. As the process was delayed, the Supreme Court on February 20, 2022 ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated cases of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. But there isn’t any indication yet of such a court being established in any of the country's seven provinces.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up one consumer court per province would not be practical as people will have to travel long distances for their cases, so the draft has proposed setting up consumer courts in each district gradually. A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers do not want to get involved in complex court cases, particularly at the Supreme Court, this has emboldened unscrupulous traders, observers say. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier and there will be fewer hassles.Consumer rights activists said that they are hopeful that the government will follow through on its announcement made in the annual budget and set up consumer courts. “With the policies and programmes for upcoming fiscal year 2024-25 mentioning the formation of consumer courts and the government allocating budget for it, we are hopeful that the court will be established in the coming fiscal year despite the long delay,” said Bishnu Prasad Timilsina, the general secretary of the Forum for Consumers' Rights.The Law Minister and Industry Minister have also committed to establishing consumer courts, and the Supreme Court has already issued an order to this effect, therefore it is expected that this time it will be implemented, Timilsina said. “And just setting up the courts alone will not be enough, they have to be effective.”\"Consumer courts need to be digitised so that consumers who have become victims can easily file their cases through applications, ensuring quick processing, and track the proceedings through digital mediums,\" Timilsina said.      \nAt least one case of cholera, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, has been confirmed in Kathmandu.According to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, a 62-year-old man from Makwanpur district, who had been admitted with severe diarrhoea some two weeks ago, tested positive for the deadly disease.The man is said to have been residing in Kathmandu for a long time.“The health condition of the patient was serious when he was brought to our hospital,” said a health worker serving at the Hospital’s Emergency Department, asking not to be named, as the official was not authorised to speak to the media. “The stool test confirmed a cholera infection.”According to health workers at the hospital, Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in stool samples of infected patients.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.The Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak in the monsoon of 2022 in which 77 cholera-positive cases were confirmed. Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.”Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.”Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago. An Indian national who is a truck driver was admitted to the Sukraraj Hospital at that time.“We had mobilised our team to investigate the source of the outbreak,” said Sapkota. Doctors warn that concealing outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and failing to investigate their sources and inform the public about the risks can prove counterproductive, as the deadly bacteria keep spreading in communities if preventative measures are not taken.Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected with them every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main catalysts for the spread of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City that were highly affected by the outbreak. In October 2021, a Vibrio cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu district killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man.Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts failed to curb the infection.The World Health Organisation says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera.A combination of careful survey, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nPost-monsoon is considered the dengue epidemic season. However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death. \nSevere heat in the Tarai region has affected ongoing polio vaccination programmes.Officials at the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services say the immunisation campaign has been affected by school closures due to scorching heat.“The immunisation campaign will resume once schools resume their regular classes,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “It will take more time for the campaign to complete due to the severe heat in Tarai districts.”Several districts’ maximum temperatures have either reached close to or crossed 40 degrees Celsius in the last few days. On Tuesday, Dhangadhi recorded 40.4 degrees Celsius, Nepalgunj 40.2 degrees Celsius and Birendranagar 37.3 degrees Celsius, the Met office’s data shows.Met officials anticipate monsoon will start at the end of next week and bring respite from scorching heat.Over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 are being inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a nationwide immunisation drive started on May 26.Officials said that children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.Gautam said that vaccination programmes are being carried out smoothly in the rest of the places. The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. \nThe 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” \nThe government has allocated Rs86.24 billion to the health sector for the upcoming fiscal year, around a 2.5 percent increase from the 83.99 billion allocated for the current fiscal year.The new allocation is only around 4.6 percent of the total budget.Funds have been allocated to give continuity to most of the ongoing programmes—safe motherhood programmes, free essential medicines, setting up basic health care centres in all wards throughout the country, and financial relief to people from difficult and expensive diseases—cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal failure, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, head and spinal injury, sickle cell anaemia, and stroke. The health budget also includes grants to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal Police Hospital, Nepal Army Hospital, Civil Hospital, and others. The national budget has announced a few new programmes, including the establishment of the Sita Dahal Memorial College of Naturopathy and Yogic Science under Kathmandu University. Sita Dahal is the late wife of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who died in July last year. Health experts said that the incumbent government neglected the health sector this year, too, as a slight increase in the annual budget does not help to continue the existing health programme.“How can we achieve the Sustainable Development Goals targets from the budget allocated to the health care sectors?” said Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, former chief specialist at the Ministry of Health and Population. “We need to bring qualitative change, and for that, huge investments are required.”Several healthcare programmes, including safe motherhood programmes, child health programmes, tuberculosis control, nutrition, vector control programmes, epidemic control, non-communicable diseases, and mental health programmes, have already been affected by the cut in the previous year’s budget.Likewise, the budget doesn't address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases.Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.Nepal has witnessed several outbreaks in recent years—dengue, cholera diarrheal diseases, and other vector-borne diseases. The country has failed to achieve the malaria elimination target.“Every hour, one person commits suicide, the burden of non-communicable diseases has increased alarmingly, and neonatal deaths have not declined in the past several years,” said Shrestha. “Several programmes of health, including a free screening of cervical cancer and renal problems in the state-run health facilities, could not be implemented due to various reasons. The budget allocated for health even does not support continuing the ongoing programmes.”Experts caution that budgetary cuts in crucial healthcare programmes would have a long-term impact and could affect the achievements made over the years.“The government has not allocated the health budget to strengthen the federal structures,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Chand, former chief of the Policy Planning and International Cooperation Division at the Ministry of Health. “Most of the health budget will be spent on the salaries of the staffers.” \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nNepal can finally breathe a sigh of relief and will have at least something to cheer for when they return home from Saudi Arabia—thanks to a spirited battle against a strong Yemen.The Gorkhalis headed into their last Group H game of the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers against Yemen on Tuesday low in confidence after losing all of their previous five matches, with their most recent embarrassment coming in a 4-0 drubbing by group winners United Arab Emirates last week.Vincenzo Alberto Annese’s men had conceded 18 goals in five qualifiers matches, scoring none in reply.Nepal’s dismal qualifiers campaign was also partly contributed by the sheer negligence of sports authorities All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) and National Sports Council whose poor management of the country’s only international standard football venue—Dasharath Stadium—forced Nepal to play their two home matches at neutral venues.However, on Tuesday, they floored Yemen with a dogged fightback until the death after initially falling behind to a ninth minute Nasser Al Gahwashi penalty at the Prince Mohammad bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam, thanks to Sanjeeb Bista and Gillespye Jung Karki whose goals either side of the half time turned things around for Nepal.Although Mohammed Al Dahi’s equaliser in the first minute of stoppage time denied them a first victory of the qualifiers and also a first win against Yemen, their dogged display will still serve as a testament that the youth Nepali squad have a lot of potential.The draw against Yemen will especially wash the burden off the Italian coach Annese whose contract with Nepal is expiring this month.Annese, who was appointed as Nepal head coach in March last year, has been under a sharp knife following a series of disappointing results that also included a draw against minnows Bhutan, disappointing SAFF Championship campaign and World Cup Qualifiers first round struggles against Laos.The 39-year-old coach has been using the exodus of Nepali football stars including Bimal Gharti Magar and Sujal Shrestha to Australia and an inexperienced squad as his defence for Nepal’s poor run of results in the international arena.But he seems to have finally cracked the code in his probably last game with Nepal as coach. And the output against Yemen could possibly convince ANFA to trigger another extension in his contract. ANFA had added a three-month extension in Annese’s contract this year.The emergence of Sanjeeb, who only made his international debut in March this year as an 88th minute substitute during a 5-0 qualifiers loss to Bahrain, is even more promising.Sanjeeb, who played full 90 minutes in Nepal’s 3-0 loss against Bahrain before being benched in 4-0 defeat to the UAE, had a hand in both of Nepal’s goals against Yemen in Dammam.Sanjeeb, who replaced star forward Anjan Bista in the front, first pounced on a misplaced back pass from Radhawan Al Hubaishi and bent the ball past Yemen goalkeeper Mohammed Khairalah to score an equaliser in the 22nd minute.Sanjeeb then received a long pass from Chhiring Lama and served it for Karki to head home Nepal’s second goal in the 66th.It was the first international goals for both Sanjeeb and Karki. Karki made his debut for Nepal in September last year during Nepal’s goalless draw with Myanmar. The evening was also memorable for Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Playing his 100th international match, the 34-year-old goalkeeper produced a string of stunning saves to keep Yemen at bay till the final moments and helped Nepal earn a point.Even though Nepal failed to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and could not directly qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup, they still have a chance to secure their spot in their maiden Asian Cup through Asian Cup Qualification which will be played between March 25, 2025 to March 31, 2026.Top two teams from each nine groups qualified for the third round of 2026 FIFA World Cup and also secured a direct berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, China, Oman, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Indonesia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Australia and Palestine progressed.The 18 nations who failed to advance (India, Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Chinese Taipei, Turkmenistan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Philippines, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Nepal, Lebanon and Bangladesh) will compete in the 24-team AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers, with only six teams making it to the Asian Cup finals.Bhutan, the Maldives and Laos will join them in the third round of Asian Cup Qualification as the best ranking losing teams of the first round. The winners of the Asian Cup Qualifiers playoffs between Sri Lanka and Cambodia, Timor-Leste and Mongolia and Brunei Darussalam and Macau will also be in the competition. \nThe group stage match between Nepal and Sri Lanka of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup has been abandoned without a ball bowled due to downpour in Florida, USA on Wednesday.Earlier, rain forced the game, scheduled for 5:15am NPT, to be delayed. The game was called off after the rain continued with both sides sharing a point each.Nepal are at fourth position in the group standings, only followed by Sri Lanka who have lost two out of the three matches played. The Rhinos will need to win their remaining two matches to make it to the playoffs but their loss to familiar rivals Netherlands has been a thorn in their Super Eight hopes.Nepal made a disastrous start to their World Cup campaign on their return to cricket’s biggest stage after a decade as they lost their opening match to the Dutch team by six wickets in Dallas, Texas on June 4.Only the top two teams from each group progress to the next stage. \nNepal will aim to recover from their T20 World Cup opening loss against the Netherlands when they take on Sri Lanka in their second Group D match at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, the United States on Wednesday.But defeating the Lankans will be a difficult task for the Rhinos.Sri Lanka are under pressure after losing both of their opening group matches—against Bangladesh by two wickets and South Africa by six wickets—and the 2014 champions will also look to get back their World Cup campaign on track, starting with a victory against Nepal.The defeats have put Sri Lanka at the bottom of the group and will now need to win their remaining two matches to have a chance to reach the Super Eight.Only the top two teams from each group progress to the next stage.This will be the first meeting between Sri Lanka and Nepal in an international T20 match.The Rhinos, who are looking to progress out of the group stage for the first time in their second only World Cup appearance, sit in the fourth position in the five-team group.They will also need to win their remaining three matches to make it to the playoffs but their loss to familiar rivals Netherlands has been a thorn in their Super Eight hopes.Rohit Paudel was the only batter to look comfortable against the Dutch and will look to continue that momentum, while big hitter Dipendra Singh Airee will seek to regain his form after a poor show in the opening game.The Rhinos will also need to work on their openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh who have failed to build any impressive partnership recently. Against the Dutch, the duo were able to make just a 10-run opening stand, and both were out for single-digit scores.Nepal’s strength will probably lie in their bowling unit again. Nepal displayed a solid performance with the ball that gave the Dutch a tough time in their chase of a low 107-run target. This was a continuation of their good account with the ball from their warm-up game against Canada.They will now aim to exploit weakness in Sri Lanka’s batting that has remained very inconsistent at the World Cup.Against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka were fast to start and progressed to 100-3 after 14 overs but could only add 24 runs from their last six overs.The Lankans were all out for 77 against South Africa in their opening game.But Wanindu Hasaranga’s team will be in no mood to show mercy against Nepal. Yet their game will mostly depend on Pathum Nissanka, who made an outstanding 47 against the Tigers. \nFollowing visa denial for US games, Nepal's Sandeep Lamichhane joins T20 World Cup squad in West Indies for matches against South Africa and Bangladesh.\nA fire in a Kuwait building housing foreign workers killed 49 people, prompting an investigation into property owner violations and insufficient accommodation for the region's low-paid workforce.\nThe EU will impose tariffs on Chinese EVs (17.4%-38.1%) due to alleged subsidies, prompting China to threaten retaliation as the anti-subsidy investigation continues.\nSouth Korea's main opposition leader indicted for allegedly using underwear maker to facilitate a visit to North Korea and transfer funds.\nUnauthorized translations of popular international books, including those by Taslima Nasrin, are rampant in Nepal's book market, hurting authors and readers while damaging the country's reputation for intellectual property protection.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe seven provinces of Nepal will present the budget for FY 2024-25 on June 15 as per the mandate of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act 2017. The provinces are in a critical situation at the moment, as many of them are unstable. Over the past year and a half, the provinces have seen altogether 21 chief ministers and 23 floor tests.The frequent changes in the provincial governments have left the people disappointed with federalism, often questioning the very need of the provinces. However, they are not aware that this is happening due to the behaviour of senior party leaders and the federal government's neglect of the provinces. For instance, the federal government has yet to adjust the police for the provinces. The provision for adjusting police forces for the provinces was included in the budget speech for FY 2023-24 but nothing has been done yet. It seems unlikely to be addressed in the forthcoming fiscal year either, as it has not been included in either the policy and programme or the budget speech for FY 2024-25. Unless the chief ministers sit together at the Prime Minister's residence in Baluwatar, this issue will not be resolved easily or anytime soon.Downward budget trendThe provinces received an authorisation letter for a fiscal equalisation grant amounting to Rs58.67 billion for FY 2023-24. However, a few weeks ago, the federal government reduced this figure by 26 percent to Rs15.2 billion. This reduction has caused serious problems in the implementation of the provinces' programmes and projects. Furthermore, in the new budget for FY2024-25, the amount of fiscal transfers to the provinces has been significantly reduced. Despite this critical situation, the provinces have surprisingly failed to voice any concerns to the federal government.Regarding the total budget of the provinces, it was approximately Rs270 billion in FY 2023-24. The main sources of the provincial budget are grants (about 39 percent), followed by revenue sharing (VAT and excise duty), cash balance, and internal revenue. The share of internal revenue in the budget is 16 percent. The largest portion of the provincial budget (65 percent), comes through fiscal transfers, which include both grants and revenue sharing. The fiscal purse of the provinces is so limited that the total budget of the seven provinces from FY 2017-18 to FY 2023-24 was Rs1,586 billion, which is just Rs165 billion less than the budget of the federal government for FY 2023-24.The tax revenue rights of the provinces are minimal. Increasing the size of the provincial budget is possible only through fiscal transfers. These fiscal transfers are constitutional rights not only for the provinces but also for local levels. The fiscal transfers in the provinces' budget for FY 2024-25 is disappointing. For instance, in FY 2018-19, the first year full budget of the implementation of federalism, the budget of the Government of Nepal was Rs1,315 billion, while the grant for the provinces was Rs123 billion. This grant was 9.39 percent of the Nepal Government’s budget. The total budget size of the government for FY 2024-25 is Rs1,860 billion, an increase of Rs545 billion over this period.However, despite the significant increase in the overall budget, the grant for the provinces in FY 2024-25 is only Rs96 billion, which is Rs27 billion less than in FY 2018-19. In FY 2018-19, the provincial grant ratio was 9.39 percent of the government budget. This ratio has declined significantly to 5.18 percent in FY 2024-25. The provinces do not seem to be aware of these figures, but it is disappointing nevertheless.Federalism neglectedFurther, the policies and programmes of the ministries at the federal level have eroded the jurisdiction of the sub-federal levels. The federal government has intervened at the local level. While several sections of the budget mention coordination with the sub-federal levels, there is no actual consultation with these levels when presenting plans and programmes. How can the sub-federal levels take ownership of the plans and programmes developed without their coordination and cooperation? Article 81 of the Nepal Government’s budget states that Koshi will be developed as an industrial hub, Madhesh as an agricultural centre, Bagmati as an information technology hub, Gandaki as a tourism centre, Lumbini as a centre for small and medium industries, Karnali as a herbal hub, and Sudurpaschim as a religious tourism centre. However, there is no coordination with the provinces. These announcements have been made unilaterally without consultation with the provinces. Similarly, the budget mentions the Gandaki Economic Triangular Project concept without coordinating with the related provinces. Why has the federal government not discussed and consulted with the provinces regarding policies, programs, and potential plans? The constitution of Switzerland states that the federal government should consult with stakeholders, including the cantons (provinces), before implementing any new laws, programmes or projects. This consultation process is one of the key reasons for Switzerland's significant development across various sectors. For those affected by laws and policies, close discussions and consultations are essential to ensure full ownership and facilitate implementation, thereby promoting development. The rulers at the federal level have a centralist mindset. It should also be noted that in the Supreme Court decision related to the Giribandu Tea Estate, the court stated that sub-federal levels should be consulted when drafting any new bills related to concurrent rights. If one day, the Supreme Court decides on issues related to plans, programmes, and fiscal transfers and declares them unconstitutional, it should not be assumed otherwise.Centralist budgetConsider the budget from the perspective of ministerial allocation. According to the constitution, the responsibilities of ministries such as Finance, Defense, Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's Office are central in nature. However, the responsibilities of most other ministries are connected to the sub-federal levels. Despite this, the Ministry of Forestry has allocated only 18 percent of its total budget, and the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration only 11 percent for the provinces. The Ministry of Urban Development has allocated 8 percent, the Ministry of Health 7 percent, the Ministry of Water Supply 5 percent, the Ministry of Women 3 percent, the Ministry of Education 2 percent, and the Ministry of Labor only 1 percent of their budgets for the provinces. Several ministries, including Tourism, Industry, Home, Sports, Physical Infrastructure, Land and Cooperatives, Communications, and Law, have not allocated any funds to the provinces. The Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation has allocated only 0.7 percent of the total budget for the provinces.Most of the budget of the Ministry of Education and Labor is allocated to the local level, which is not an issue. However, it is unfortunate that the development ministries' budgets are not allocated to the provinces, as this undermines the essence of provincial governance. The constitution considers the province a key actor in development, but the budgets that should go to the provinces have been withheld by these Singadurbar-based ministries.Even an analysis of ministerial budget allocations from the first budget of federalism implementation (FY 2018-19) to FY 2024-25 reveals that except for 8 to 10 ministries, all others have reduced the jurisdiction of the sub-federal levels. I have detailed the analysis of ministries' programmes and projects for FY 2023-24 in this newspaper. I find that we do not need more than eight to 10 ministries at the federal level. When more than 60 percent of the functional responsibilities have been devolved to the sub-federal level, why do we need many ministries at the federal level? In Switzerland, there are only seven ministers at the federal level, including the President.To conclude, as the provinces prepare to present their budgets, they continue to suffer due to the federal government’s neglect of them. Fiscal transfers to the provinces have been significantly reduced, undermining federalism. Frequent changes in provincial governments, lack of support from the federal level, and insufficient coordination on policies and budgets complicate this issue. \nDelhi's urban water crisis, worsened by extreme heat, prompts intervention from the Supreme Court, releasing additional water from Himachal Pradesh, while highlighting Delhi's unsustainable water demand and the need for climate action planning and citizen conservation.\nNepal is a de facto caste-apartheid state. A 2007 Human Rights Watch report on the “untouchables” of India observed, “The only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid in South Africa.” The HRW has declared caste discrimination a form of “hidden apartheid”—an apt observation for Nepal as well.In the past years, caste hatred and exclusion have become more concealed yet pervasive in the Himalayan region; caste has also spread its tentacles in the global diaspora. Last month, Amnesty International criticised the government’s utter apathy and lack of accountability on the persistent plight of Dalits. The communist-populist alliance in government doesn’t seem to heed the call for change. This is clear from recently announced government policies, programmes and budgets for the fiscal year 2024-25. The authorities are bent on keeping caste hierarchy and untouchability sacred and solid. Budget for ‘Dalit skills’On March 21, 2022, attending a Dalit function in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that he was making a big announcement for the dignity and freedom of the “untouchables”. So much so that, he said, they would not forget it in over a century. He hasn’t made his supposedly phenomenal Dalit project explicit, but some Dalits still haven’t given up their hopes. Something came with this year’s budget for the Dalit community: Rs200 million to enhance Dalits’ traditional skills to create employment and promote their livelihood. This small yet seemingly significant budget has buoyed some Dalits. After all, as everybody says, something is better than nothing. However, I’m sceptical about the effectiveness of the Dalit-centred budget. Is it a big enough pot of money to significantly impact the target population? Most people would say “No”. Even some prominent Dalit NGO personalities close to the governing parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount. Equally, are Dalits the only beneficiaries of this new scheme? I don't think so. The details of the intended 200-million project haven’t been developed yet. But it seems many non-Dalits will also get the support, especially those close to the ruling parties and leaders. There are at least two reasons for my understanding. First is the very name of the entity the government plans to establish to use that money: A separate body called the “Dalit, Neglected and Oppressed Class Upliftment and Development Corporation.” The use of so many words is likely intended to involve the beneficiaries from different castes and social groups. My suspicion stems from the second fact: In today’s Nepal, traditional Dalit skills—such as goldsmithing, tailoring, woodworking, and shoemaking—are no longer exclusively practised by Dalits. Once commercialised, many castes including the apex groups, have started these trades. So, skill enhancement projects will probably not be offered only to Dalits. I am not suggesting Dalits should have exclusive rights over these essential skills. It is neither practical nor proper to make such a case. My point is that it is probably wrong to think that the budget is for the betterment of Dalits. Untouched untouchabilityI have a serious objection to the utter lack of sensitivity towards the problems of Dalits, mainly the persistent practice of untouchability (hidden apartheid) in government policies, programmes and the budget. There is no single statement in the policies that mentions untouchability, let alone try to address it. The same applies to the state and local authorities under the federal system. The biggest irony is found in the Karnali Province, where the Province Head, Tilak Pariyar, is a Dalit man with a long history of fighting against the state as part of the Maoist movement, with ending caste oppression as a primary goal. On May 23, he presented 84-point policies and programmes of the province. Study it in detail, and aside from lip service here and there, there is no serious concern about the situation of Dalits in Karnali who have been facing caste humiliation and violence like nowhere else in the country. Yet the authorities seem totally blind to the realities! Recommended policy objectives What should a responsible government do, both in Kathmandu and Karnali? First, the federal capital should become sensitive towards the plight of Dalits, who suffer tremendously due to popular beliefs and practices of ritual impurity. Then, the federal capital should design a national policy framework that could be followed by the lower authorities.On a Sunday press meet, Caste Watch Network (CWN), a newly launched Dalit campaign group, recommended two fundamental policy objectives for tackling the complex problem of untouchability.First, the state should introduce new laws and policies—sticks and carrots—to enforce the constitutional and legal provisions against untouchability. It could, for example, forge a policy of immediately suspending government officials guilty of excluding and humiliating Dalits. Elderly people who discriminate against Dalits could be deprived of their elderly pensions for two years or so. Any temple practising Dalit exclusion could be deprived of state support in the form of money and sacred offerings and sacrificial animals (yes, even the historical and famous temples like Gorakhkali and Manakamana do practise a form of social exclusion). The second important policy objective would be to reform the religion. Some people frown at my suggestions about initiating religious and cultural reform, which they think takes many decades, if not centuries.While we cannot easily rewrite casteist texts like Manusmriti and Parasaramriti, it is possible to achieve the reformation of some religious beliefs and practices over time. For that, the secular state should stand firm against religious dogma and formulate proper laws and implement them. If no religious and/or cultural reform were possible at all, we would still be burning our mothers and sisters and other women alive on the sati pyres. If reform weren’t possible, we wouldn’t see a section of Bahuns drinking alcohol and consuming pork, and, as alluded to earlier, engaging in tailoring, drumming, shoemaking and goldsmithing. Upper castes have deceived Dalits. They have forced religious and cultural transformations in areas that benefit them materially and in other ways. And they have been opposed to the reform of those areas of religious and cultural traditions that would ensure equal rights for Dalits. For example, a Bahun doesn’t become polluted by drinking and drumming; these transgressions do not anger his deities. But he thinks he and his family, lineage and other deities and spirits become polluted if a drummer enters his house. Religious-cultural reform is not as tough as it seems. Governments and authorities at all levels should introduce new laws and policies and spend large sums to change the spiritual, religious and cultural spheres. Without this, we cannot do away with untouchability. \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal inaugurated its second general convention on Monday. The Upendra Yadav-led party is holding the mega event at a time the party has suffered multiple setbacks. Seven of its 12 federal lawmakers split the JSP-Nepal and registered a new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—at the Election Commission last month. The party of Upendra Yadav, who headed the party that had continuously led Madhesh provincial government since 2018, has been pushed to the opposition bench in the provincial assembly. Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and health minister in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet until last month, has been ousted from the federal government as well. Despite such adverse circumstances, Yadav is poised to be the party chief again, most likely unopposed.Yadav rose to power after successfully spearheading a Madhesh movement in 2007 demanding rights for the historically marginalised Madheshi people. Though the demand for federalism had been raised by various quarters even in the past, it was Yadav-led agitation that eventually forced the Nepali state to introduce the federal system in the country. He formed Madheshi Janadhikar Forum-Nepal under his own leadership. Since then he has always been at the helm of a party. He has merged his party with various outfits, multiple times, only to split again.With the rise of Madheshi parties in the aftermath of the second people’s movement in 2006, people—not only from the southern belt of the country but also from most marginalised communities—had high hopes for a paradigm shift in Nepali politics. The big parties traditionally holding power, namely the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, had felt pressure. But within years of their joining governments in Kathmandu, people were disenchanted by their performance. A section of people expected that the regional parties would do better when allowed to lead provincial governments. They failed in the province as well.In Nepal, communist leaders and parties have been infamous for persistent disputes and divisions, mostly after the 1990 political change. When parties mushroomed in Madhesh, they beat the communists in terms of infightings and divisions. There is not a single party in Madhesh that remained intact, which is disappointing for those who expected that regional forces would build pressure on traditional forces through better delivery.Mismanagement, lack of organisational discipline, non-transparency and top leaders’ monopoly in decision-making have become common traits of Madhesh-based parties. Big parties such as the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre are criticised for being monopolistic and rather undemocratic. But, newer forces proved themselves worse. For instance, at least the big parties have been holding their general conventions as per the constitutional provision. Their provincial, district and village units are also elected through a process. For example, the UML is now electing its district leaders through conventions. When they fail to pick leaders in consensus, they readily go for a vote. Top leaders may favour those loyal to them but even these loyalists must nonetheless follow the process. That is why the UML is considered the most organised party in the country. The Congress also follows at least basic democratic norms while electing its leaders and making important decisions. But we don’t see the same in Madhesh-based and other newly emerged forces. This is unfortunate. Only political parties that are well-organised, democratic and transparent in their activities will have the moral strength to mount pressure on big forces. Those who can’t maintain democracy and transparency in their own organisations can’t ensure it in the government when they come to power. We hardly find any leader in Madhesh handing over party leadership to other leaders through a democratic process. We hope that in the ongoing convention Yadav’s JSP-Nepal can bring policies to make the party organisation more transparent and democratic. \nAmbassadors aren’t magicians. No matter how good their PR skills are, it takes time and effort to cultivate good working relations with the officials of their host countries. When a country constantly chops and changes its ambassadors, diplomacy becomes difficult. Nepali political parties have a wretched record of abruptly recalling ambassadors appointed by the previous coalition governments. But Thursday's silly recall of Dr Shankar Sharma, Nepali ambassador to India, must be the most egregious of them all. The Cabinet decided to recall Sharma days ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s New Delhi visit to attend the third swearing-in of Narendra Modi as India’s prime minister. Why couldn’t Dahal have waited until he got back from New Delhi? With what authority would an ambassador that his prime minister clearly does not trust coordinate his India trip? Why the rush, one wonders. Of course, it is natural for a new government to want to appoint those it can rely on as the country’s envoys. But then our envoys are Nepal’s representatives abroad, whose conduct can make or break the country’s image. This is why only the most capable of them should make the cut. And if the best of the best are chosen, they should be allowed to work for the four full years. This time, the government has recalled not just its Indian ambassador but also its envoys from 10 other countries, including the US and the UK. Notably, these envoys were appointed by the same prime minister before he changed his main coalition partner, from the Nepali Congress to the CPN-UML. This is unfortunate. Political instability has had a devastating impact on Nepali economy as it now struggles to achieve even a modest 4 percent annual growth. It has destroyed our domestic institutions. The same instability is now also affecting our standing abroad. If Nepal’s major political actors cannot send a message of unity and purpose to the rest of the world, how will others trust us? Why would they come and invest in Nepal?Our relations with major powers like India and the US are not things to be trifled with, at a time of heightened geopolitical competition in the region. In these contested times, the only way Nepal can safely navigate the choppy geopolitical waters is through mature diplomacy. Appoint the right people in the right capitals and give them a free hand. What is particularly strange about the most recent recall of 11 ambassadors is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to have been bypassed, as the decision was apparently made against the advice of Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha. This is not the first time that the advice of the foreign ministry has been sidelined. The diplomatic code of conduct is widely ignored and the ministry continues to be kept out of the loop as our top leaders engage with their foreign counterparts. Again, even if the ambassadors are to be appointed on political quotas (which they ideally should not), there can be a political understanding to pick the best of the lot and to let them serve out their term. Unless that happens, political instability at home will continue to harm Nepal's foreign conduct, with grave consequences for the Nepali national interest.  \nSatish Singh of the Janamat Party is set to become Madhesh Province's new chief minister after Saroj Kumar Yadav lost a vote of confidence, marking the 21st government change in Nepal's provinces since 2022 elections, reflecting instability due to coalition politics and disregarding people's concerns.\nThe federal system in Nepal, adopted in 2015, has faced challenges due to parties' reluctance to accept its spirit, resulting in centralized decision-making and a lack of provincial autonomy.\nThe Nepali Congress negotiated with the ruling parties to define the jurisdiction of a parliamentary committee tasked with investigating the cooperative scam and secured the inclusion of Gorkha Media Network in the probe, though Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane's name was not explicitly mentioned.\nDespite growing human rights backsliding and shrinking civic space globally, particularly in South Asia, Nepal faces challenges in its transitional justice process, including categorizing crimes as serious and non-serious, leading to potential impunity for perpetrators.\nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) is preparing for its first general convention, seeking to address policy and leadership issues after a record of poor performance since its 2021 formation.\nAs the UN Resident Coordinator, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy discusses Nepal's progress towards SDGs, LDC graduation challenges, peace consolidation, and the UN's role amidst geopolitical polarization.\nPartly cloudy skies with slight rain in some areas, while Kathmandu anticipates a high of 31°C and partly sunny conditions; Nepalgunj remains the warmest at 43.6°C, with Jomsom experiencing the coldest at 14°C.\nPartly cloudy to fair weather is expected nationwide, with some regions experiencing light rain and thunderstorms, and Kathmandu reaching a maximum temperature of 31 degrees Celsius.\nCracks in 200+ locations found in Nepal after earthquake, posing flood and landslide risks during upcoming monsoon, despite vulnerable populations remaining in unfit areas and the government lacking relocation plans.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nIn February 1984, Maciej Berbeka and Maciej Pawlikowski of Poland became the first people to climb Cho Oyu, the sixth-highest mountain in the world, from the Nepal side.The mountain, which straddles the Nepal-China border, lies 20 km west of Everest. The 8,201-metre peak was first scaled in winter from the southeast pillar. The caravan route was Kathmandu-Lukla-Namce-Gokyo and Cho Oyu base camp.After three years, in May 1987, Ang Phuri Sherpa became the first Nepali to reach the peak from the Nepal side. It was in spring. Then a group of Russian climbers summited the peak in the autumn of 1991, followed by two Japanese in 1994.The last time Cho Oyu was conquered was in the spring of 2009, when Denis Urubko and Boris Dedeshko of Kazakhstan reached its top. After a decade and a half, a seven-member Sherpa team, including a French national, reached the summit last week. Cho Oyu is considered one of the most accessible 8,000ers from the Chinese side, while the Nepal side is considered among the toughest.Only 21 people have reached Cho Oyu from Nepal’s side in the past 70 years. By contrast, more than 4,000 have successfully climbed the mountain from the Tibetan side. This makes Cho Oyo the second most climbed eight-thousander after Everest.Among the 8,000ers, Cho Oyu has the lowest death rate.On June 7, the French Alasdair McKenzie, with Gelje, Tenging Gyaljen and other sherpas, stood atop Cho Oyu at 8:35 pm via the southwest ridge. The caravan route was Kathmandu-Lukla-Namche-Thame and Cho Oyu base camp.Unlike past expeditions, last week’s climb was meant to prepare a permanent route for a commercial expedition from the Nepal side.“With this success, Cho Oyu has become more accessible from Nepal, heralding a new era in Nepali mountaineering and inspiring future expeditions to tackle its challenging routes,” said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks, the agency which explored the local route. Nepal boasts of eight of the 14 highest peaks over 8,000m on the planet. They are Everest, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, Cho Oyu and Annapurna. But to climb Cho Oyu, climbers usually had to go to Tibet first.“From now onwards, commercial expeditions will happen from the Nepal side. This is good news for all expedition agencies. Climbers will no longer need to go through a long process of getting permission from the Tibetan authority. All eight mountains above 8,000 are now accessible from the Nepal side,” said Mingma.Last Friday, the team started the summit push at 2:00 am from Camp IV, and after a relentless effort of over 18 hours, they made it to the top. “This remarkable achievement was the result of a meticulously planned expedition that started in March and commenced in the first week of May from Lukla,” said Mingma.According to Mingma, a commercial expedition on Cho Oyu may last 60 days and could cost a foreigner between $25,000 and $30,000.“That’s obviously a welcome development. It will create more jobs on the mountain,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. “But it’s too early to say whether the route will be a commercial success,” he said. For instance, the operating cost incurred from the Nepali side is nearly double that from the Tibetan side, in addition to the challenges a vertical wall poses.Transporting goods from Kathmandu to the Cho Oyu base camp would cost $5 per kg. However, as the road reaches the advanced base camp or camp above the base camp of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side, the cost on that route would be $2 per kg.“There is a lot of difference in the operating costs. Climbing from the Tibetan side would cost $13,000 a person,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa. “So, obviously, the climber's preference would be the Tibetan side. First due to the lower factor, and, second, it’s an easier climb from the north.”The success of the new route will depend on its commercial feasibility.Mingma said Cho Oyu’s Nepal side is known for its steep, vertical walls rising thousands of metres, making it one of the greatest present-day challenges. He, however, said once the route becomes commercial, competition will bring down the cost.“More than that, foreigners do not need to wait weeks or even months for the Tibetan authority’s permit to climb.”The story of the first expedition, from the Tibetan side, however, is more interesting.According to the archive of Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, Cho Oyu was first chosen for an expedition in 1952 in preparation for an Everest ascent the following year.The first attempt of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side was made by a British party led by Eric Shipton, with Edmund Hillary, George Lowe, Charles Evans, and Tom Bourdilon as its members. However, technical difficulties at an ice cliff above 6,650m forced them to give up the climb.According to the archive, the expedition, led by the British Eric Shipton, was estimated to take two weeks. “It would also mean entering the Tibetan territory, which it is believed Shipton was unwilling to do,” according to the archive.It was Shipton who first measured Cho Oyu as the sixth-highest mountain in the world.An Austrian expedition, led by Herbert Tichy, arrived in Birgunj in 1954 via India and flew into Kathmandu on an Indian airliner of the time. Once they were packed and ready, they moved to Bhaktapur, from where the long trek to the mountain would begin.There were only three foreign climbers and eleven sherpas on the team.Cho Oyu was finally climbed on October 19, 1954, via the northwest ridge in Tibet by Tichy, Joseph Jöchler and Pasang Dawa Lama.Before Cho Oyu, Everest and Annapurna in Nepal, and Nanga Parbat in Pakistan had been climbed. \nThe ruling and opposition parties might appear divided as they relentlessly attack each other on different issues, but when it comes to criticising the decisions of Sumana Shrestha, the minister for education, science, and technology, they have one voice.Shortly after taking charge of the ministry, Shrestha started a process of taking action against the teachers and professors involved in party politics. The ministry has sought information on the teachers and professors affiliated to the parties from the Election Commission and the respective district education units.The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017 which prohibits the teachers, professors and other government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that school teachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from the state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics. The major parties have disapproved of Shrestha’s move as a large number of teachers are their cadres. For instance, as many as 263 of the 4,743 representatives to the Nepali Congress general convention held in December 2021 were school teachers and staff. The number is above five percent of the total delegates.The main opposition CPN-UML also had dozens of teachers as representatives in its 10th general congress held in November that year. Hundreds of school teachers are associated with the CPN (Maoist Centre) as well.Leaders from all these parties have criticised the move directly or indirectly. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel said the principals of many best-performing community schools were affiliated to different parties.“It is unnecessary to test teachers’ DNA. Let them work,” he said, implying that there was no need to probe whether the teachers are affiliated to a political party.Another factor antagonising the major parties is Shrestha’s decision to make public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission— more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli.On June 7, she made public the report that Oli and his successors had for years kept under wraps. The government was under the pressure of private schools to keep the report a secret as it envisions converting the schools registered as companies into trusts within 10 years. Converting the existing schools into trusts would mean they will be barred from taking profits home. Several cross-party leaders have investments in private schools.Oli was so annoyed by Minister Shrestha’s decision to make the report public that he resorted to making personal remarks about her nationality and marital status without naming her.Now the teachers’ unions of various parties have united against her. The ministry on May 27 endorsed a directive guiding teachers’ transfers. The directive came amid allegations that teachers are being transferred without fulfilling the due procedure. The directive is accused of encroaching on the authority of the School Management Committee and increasing the ministry’s role in transfers. “Your good education is meaningless if you are doing more harm than good to the education sector,” said Shankar Adhikari, chair of the teacher association close to the Maoist Centre, referring to Shrestha’s foreign degree. “She has a shallow understanding of Nepal's education sector.”Leaders of other teacher associations have asked the minister to reverse the directive, warning of the consequences of not doing so. “The directive was issued with the mala fide intent of troubling teachers. This is unacceptable,” said Gyanedra Rawal of the Nepal Teachers’ Union, the Congress teachers’ wing.Some lawmakers and education experts, however, have supported minister Shrestha, saying she is on the right track to improve the country's education sector. Addressing the lower house meeting on Wednesday, independent lawmaker Amresh Kumar Singh said he fully supports the education minister, who is making the necessary intervention. “The education minister is taking the right course. Her works need to be appreciated,” he said.Those who have followed Shrestha’s work also praise her. “She [Shrestha] is eager to bring about vital changes, mainly in school education,” said Usha Jha, a former member of the National Planning Commission.However, many officials at the ministry are unhappy with her work. While she is dedicated to her job, she has a habit of not listening to others, they allege. “The minister thinks she knows everything and is not accommodative. This is the reason her decisions are dragged into controversy,” said a senior official at the ministry. “A minister is a team leader who has to take all the staff along. But that is not the case now.” \nTwo Nepali nationals sustained minor injuries while three others are safe following a devastating fire in a residential building in Kuwait, the Nepali Embassy in Kuwait said. The injured have been identified as Shiv Shankar Paswan and Dorje Lama.At least 49 people have died in the fire in a building housing foreign workers, media reports said. Kuwait's deputy prime minister, Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Saud Al-Sabah, blamed property owners for violations that contribute towards such incidents, a Reuters report said. Of the 49 dead, 40 were Indian nationals, according to some Indian media reports. Local authorities have not disclosed the nationalities of the casualties.Nepali Ambassador to Kuwait, Ghanshyam Lamsal, told the Post over the phone that five Nepali nationals were living in that ill-fated building. “Two others had left the building early in the morning and are safe,” Lamsal said after visiting the two injured Nepali in the hospital. The five Nepalis living in the building have been identified as Dorje Lama of Jhapa, and Shiv Shankar Paswan, Dinesh Kumar Mandal, Santos Kumar Goti and Jakir Nadap of Siraha district. One Nepali national escaped the inferno without injuries.“Only two Nepalis were injured and are currently undergoing treatment in a local hospital. They are out of danger,” said Lamsal.A team of embassy officials, supported by local authorities, met with the injured Nepalis.They told officials that they lived on the second floor of the building. When the fire broke out from the ground floor, two descended behind the building using a rope. Another Nepali national was on the ground floor and managed to escape as soon as the fire broke out. Two Nepali nationals were away at work, according to Lamsal.“We spoke with several Nepali nationals as well as those living in that particular building. We learnt that only a few Nepalis were living in that building, so we believe it is unlikely that any Nepalis have died,” said Lamsal.“A rescue operation is going on so we do not have details about the incident and casualties,” he said, adding, “By tomorrow, we will have more details.” \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel, who left for a weeklong visit to Switzerland and Germany on Tuesday evening, reached Geneva on Wednesday.He had a meeting with President of the Swiss Confederation Viola Amherd. They discussed issues of bilateral interest. Paudel said Nepal is in need of more foreign aid as it is set to graduate to a developing country in 2026. In response, the Swiss president said her government was ready to provide all the support needed, according to Kiran Pokharel, the press adviser to the President.Earlier, Nepali Ambassador to Switzerland Ram Prasad Subedi, and embassy officials welcomed President Paudel and his entourage at Geneva Airport.The President and his delegation left Kathmandu for Qatar on Tuesday on their way to Geneva. They reached Doha on Tuesday evening, where they were welcomed by Nepali Ambassador to Qatar Naresh Bikram Dhakal and other officials.After a couple of hours of layover at Doha airport, the President and his delegation left for Geneva.According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, President Paudel will attend the inaugural forum of the Global Coalition for Social Justice, slated to coincide with the high-level segment of the 112th session of the International Labour Organisation.Paudel is scheduled to address the forum on Thursday.On Saturday, the President and the Nepali delegation will leave for Berlin, Germany. Paudel is scheduled to hold a meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Monday evening. \nA meeting of the ‘Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase’ in Bangladesh on Tuesday approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. The proposal was put forth by the Power Division of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).It was one of the 15 proposals endorsed by the Cabinet Committee chaired by Finance Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali of Bangladesh, according to the National News Agency of Bangladesh.Secretary of the Cabinet Division (Coordination and Reform) Md Mahmudul Hossain Khan of Bangladesh told reporters that following a proposal from the Power Division, the BPDP would import 40MW hydroelectricity for five years from Nepal under a tripartite agreement between the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited (NVVN) India, and the BPDB, the report said.Bangladeshi media reports said the power will be traded at 8.17 Bangladeshi Taka, (about Rs9.30) per unit.The delivery point will be a 400kV substation at Muzaffarpur in India, and Bangladesh will pay the transmission charge for using the Indian transmission infrastructure.The date of final agreement between Nepal and Bangladesh on the matter has yet to be finalised. However, it will most likely take place during Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s potential Nepal visit, according to Khan.Nepal and Bangladesh had agreed to sign a tripartite agreement involving the NEA, the BPDP and the NVVN during the meeting of the energy secretary-level joint steering committee in May 2023.Earlier in February, Bangladesh had sent a draft request for proposal (RfP) in response to which Nepal had proposed the tariff. Besides tariff, Nepal had also included details on how Nepal would deliver power to Bangladesh.The two countries agreed on the trading amount on the sidelines of the SAARC Energy Centre’s secretary-level meeting held in Singapore from February 23 to 26, 2024. \nNepal and Sri Lanka shared a point each after heavy rain in Florida and waterlogged outfield at the Central Broward Stadium in Lauderhill led to the abandonment of their T20 World Cup Group D match on Tuesday.The outcome means Group D leaders South Africa became the first team in the 20-team tournament to progress to the Super Eight stage. The Proteas are unbeaten and have won all three matches they have played. They have six points from three games.The result also leaves former champions Sri Lanka without a win after three games and puts the Lankans on the brink of elimination from group stage. Sri Lanka lost their opening games to South Africa and Bangladesh. They face the Netherlands in Gros Islet in their final group game on Monday but may find themselves already out of the tournament by then.Nepal lost to the Dutch in their opening game and sit in the fourth position with one point. But they still have a chance to progress to the Super Eight if they win both of their remaining matches. They play against South Africa on Saturday and Bangladesh on Monday.Bangladesh and the Netherlands are tied on two points but the Tigers occupy the second spot due to net run rate. Both of them have two matches in hand. \nTorrential rains often signal the onset of the early monsoon month of Asar. But when it rains money on roads and project sites, we may consider that, too, to be a sign of the month’s onset. Each year, as the fiscal year enters the eleventh month, government agencies and contractors wake up from their slumber and pull up their socks to either make payments or work for the payments received. Last-minute capital spending repeats each financial year, exposing the inefficiency with which Nepal’s development sector operates. This model of “development” has a nomenclature of its own—Asarey Vikaas. Thanks to the Asarey Vikas model, the roads that were bumpy until last night would have turned smooth and shiny this morning. Roads often become the sites for the manifestation of such an ill-planned model of development, leaving even the locals who have learnt not to expect anything from the government surprised at the sudden transformation of their roads. After all, the government has money to spend, and contractors have work to finish to claim that money. But such hurried spending has a major problem: The work being done is substandard. The road that was blacktopped overnight to meet the spending deadline of this financial year will hardly last until the end of the next financial year. Between June 10 and July 15, 2020, the capital spending jumped by 17 percent in the last month of the fiscal year as the government rushed to increase such expenditure. Before the rush, the capital expenditure had been just 30 percent in the first 11 months of that fiscal year. In FY 2020/21, the government spent 21 percent of the total budget in a single month, between mid-June and mid-July. As of June 12, a little over a month before the end of FY 2023/24, capital expenditure was a mere 44 percent, which means that the government has failed to spend the budget allocated, making it difficult to meet the development targets. Experts blame bureaucratic red tape for the delay in capital expenditure, as it takes months for even small amounts of bills to be cleared. Moreover, projects are often initiated randomly without ensuring the financial resources, leading to failure to move them forward. Previous governments tried to address the problem through budget implementation guidelines. Last year, the government made it mandatory to complete the call for bids and contract signing of projects by mid-November and begin work within 15 days of the signing. It said the plans and programmes that failed to meet this deadline would not get any budget. The 81-point budget implementation guideline has specific provisions on project completion timeline, payment, budget transfers and other matters of financial discipline. The government cannot maintain a lacklustre attitude when it comes to capital expenditure, as it has a detrimental effect on the country’s overall development. It is time to streamline the monitoring, evaluation and payment systems to ensure that the government’s plans and programmes move forward and are completed within the stipulated deadline. The last-minute spending rush should become a thing of the past—which will also be a solid proof of the government’s commitment to improving people’s lives through judicious spending.  \nThe Constitution of Nepal defines health as a fundamental right, stating that every citizen is entitled to free basic health services. However, due to high costs, over half a million Nepalis are deprived of primary healthcare. The country has 7,221 public health facilities, including 125 hospitals, 205 primary health care centres, 395 ayurvedic hospitals, 3,870 health posts and 2,626 community health centres and private health institutions. Despite this wide healthcare structure, the system still struggles to provide accessible and affordable healthcare services to the entire population. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that poverty increases by 2 percent every year due to high out-of-pocket expenditure (OOP) on health services from the private sector. In Nepal, the OOP constitutes 57.7 percent of the current health expenditure, while the government’s share is only 22.6 percent. Nepal has introduced schemes such as the Social Security Fund, the Employee Provident Fund, and the National Health Insurance Programme (NHIP), as well as enterprise private insurance, free healthcare, conditional cash transfer programmes, and improvised citizen programmes to reduce OOP and improve accessibility. However, the effectiveness of these schemes still remains in question. An appropriate pre-financing mechanism is needed to reduce the uncertainty of health illness and the catastrophic cost associated with healthcare. Nepal Government introduced the National Insurance Programme in 2016 to comply with the constitution and work towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030, a vital aspect of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UHC ensures access to quality healthcare without financial hardships. The target of SDG8 has two indicators: Coverage of essential healthcare services and financial protection for all. Low insurance coverageThe NHIP was designed to offer quality care at a minimal cost, guided by legal and policy frameworks to achieve the UHC. It was initially piloted in three districts—Kailali, Baglung and Illam. Despite a favourable policy environment, coverage and retention are not up to the mark, with only 23 percent enrollment and a significant dropout of 25 percent, which is a serious concern. Coverage is uneven, with Koshi province achieving 42 percent coverage while Madhesh lags at 8 percent. The programme also inadequately covers only 26 out of 77 districts of ultra-poor citizens. Although the NHIP aims to cover the nationwide population by 2030, numerous challenges lie ahead.The NHIP faces several barriers, including epidemiological and geographical limitations, limited risk pooling, stagnant financing, lack of financial sustainability assessment, difficulty in seeking referral services, inadequate local-level empanelment of health facilities, limited digitalisation of the NHIP functions and insufficient government ownership. To improve the NHIP and move towards universal healthcare, Nepal can learn about successful health insurance programmes of other countries. Lessons from elsewhereEvery country has a different insurance system to achieve universal healthcare goals. Japan uses a single-payer system where the government is the sole payer for healthcare services. By centralising the payment through the government, Japan has control over healthcare costs and maintains high standards of care. It is designed to provide universal health coverage and ensure accessibility of healthcare services to all people. Singapore uses a hybrid system where individual responsibility is balanced with government support. This approach aims to provide comprehensive coverage while maintaining sustainability and encouraging accountability in healthcare expenditures. Rwanda’s community-based health insurance programme mandates participation, particularly targeting rural and poor populations. The premium rates are progressive, i.e., based on income levels, ensuring the poorer individual pays less. Thailand has significantly improved health insurance coverage through contributions from civil servants and voluntary participation from those in the informal sector. Civil servants contribute to the system as part of their employment benefits, and for those in the informal sector, voluntary schemes are available, encouraging broader participation. This mixed approach helps to expand coverage and promotes universal health coverage. The United Kingdom has a publicly funded health system that provides medical services to the entire population regardless of socioeconomic status. Nepal can learn from the benefits of a tax-funded system, which offers preventive, promotive and curative health coverage. RecommendationsThe provision of health insurance is in its early stages in Nepal, so revising the benefits package to make it more comprehensive and focusing on enrolling underserved populations in Karnali, Sudurpaschim and Madhesh is essential. Instituting mobile clinics, community-based initiatives and strategic infrastructure development can help overcome geographical barriers and provide equitable healthcare services. Developing a sustainability roadmap, exploring innovative financing mechanisms and increasing healthcare spending should be emphasised to meet international benchmarks. Digitalising NHIP activities can improve efficiency, transparency and service delivery. National surveys to determine the coverage gap are vital in assessing the drop-out rate and increasing sustainability. Strengthening the NHIP is crucial for Nepal’s goal of achieving universal health care. Addressing the identified challenges and implementing proposed recommendations can enhance the NHIP’s effectiveness, ensuring equitable access to quality healthcare. Addressing disparities in health outcomes and financing mechanisms is also crucial to improving overall population health and ensuring everyone has access to quality healthcare. Improving worker training and supervision and prioritising service provider education, quality assurance, and preventive care could strengthen NHIP care. Enhancing rural healthcare accessibility is also necessary for health insurance. The government has increased the budget for the insurance programme, but its share of total health sector spending remains low compared to international benchmarks. The World Health Organization predicts that allocating 5 to 6 percent of GDP or 10 percent of the national budget towards healthcare will effectively cap out-of-pocket expenses. Despite this, Nepal consistently allocates below 5 percent of its national budget to healthcare. Increased funding in the healthcare system should be highly prioritised for the successful implementation of the NHIP.Sustainability issues can be addressed through social health insurance contributions and public-private partnerships. Continuous training and skill development for healthcare personnel can improve the quality of care. Performance-based payments can incentivise healthcare facilities to improve quality and efficiency. Using a mix of different funding methods instead of relying on just one is essential for providing universal healthcare and affordable healthcare services. A national health financing system should ensure every citizen can access healthcare when needed and protect families from financial catastrophe by covering out-of-pocket expenditures. Comprehensive governance and regulatory reform strategies are required to improve the scope, accessibility, quality, and sustainability of national health insurance coverage.  \nThey are everywhere. Sweeping floors in the homes of the wealthy, serving tea at stands, begging outside shopping malls, cleaning car windshields, working in brick kilns, and tilling the soil.Pakistan has several pieces of legislation that deal with child labour and yet millions of children are exploited and put to work in full view of the rest of us. It is estimated that Pakistan has over 12 million children who are victims of child labour.According to data compiled in 2021, the vast majority of these children are working in the agricultural sector, helping with planting and harvesting wheat and cotton. They also work in the deep sea fishing and poultry sectors. In the industrial sector, they make glass bangles, amongst other occupations. Other hazardous occupations, sometimes claiming their health and life, are coal and gemstone mining.Around 1.5m are forced to beg, while thousands are exploited as sex workers. These are damning, but not shocking, facts. There is no one in Pakistan who does not encounter small children working around them every single day. We have many laws that pretend to address the problem, but the fact that almost none of them are enforced reveals that there is widespread public acceptance of children being put to work. This is a reprehensible situation and a moral indictment of an entire country.In this atmosphere of apathy and disinterest in making things better, a few grassroots activists are trying to make a difference in the lives of these poor and exploited children. One such activist is a woman farmer called Shagufta Yasmeen.According to Shagufta, when children come to work in the fields, they are often harvesting wheat or cotton. This brings the children into contact with very strong and harmful pesticides that are being sprayed on the crop. Shagufta works with the EU-funded Clear Cotton Project, which is trying to raise awareness about the need to reduce child labour in the cotton fields and especially about the harms of pesticide exposure to children whose brains and bodies are still developing. Long-term exposure to pesticides has also been known to cause cancer and other debilitating conditions in children.In her report published in The Guardian last August, journalist Zofeen T Ebrahim asked, “How many more poor child workers must die in Pakistan before change happens?” It is a good question that has still not been answered almost a year later.In the report, the journalist recounts the death of 10-year-old Fatima Furiro who was found dead in a mansion in Khairpur. Her tortured body was later exhumed for autopsy. Furiro had been sent by her parents to work in the home of Pir Asad Ali Shah Jeelani. The postmortem confirmed that the little domestic worker had been tortured, raped and abused over a protracted period of time. Videos showing an injured Fatima struggling to sit up before collapsing went viral.Of all the child workers whose childhood and innocence are trashed when they are sent to work, little girls working in domestic settings are perhaps the most vulnerable. Educated and wealthy members of society, who otherwise espouse a great commitment to charity and to being good Muslims, regularly ignore the exploitation of these little girls, even though it takes place under their very noses every single day. Because these girls work in private spaces in the homes of people, they can easily be physically and sexually abused without any consequences for the perpetrator.In other cases, these little girl workers who are barely 10 or 11 years old themselves are employed as caregivers for small babies. As wealthy mothers’ shop, chat with friends, and eat at fancy restaurants these little girls trail them like slaves who are indentured to serve and cannot expect any just or fair treatment. Nearly everyone in cities like Karachi and Lahore has seen these little girls sitting on the side or the floor while the rest of the family enjoys a fancy meal without even thinking of feeding them.It is just this sort of dehumanisation, perpetrated by the well-educated and wealthy, that allows child labour to continue unchecked in the country. The reason that legislation, whose ostensible purpose is to end child labour and protect our young ones from the kind of brutality inflicted on little Fatima Furiro, is not implemented is because, in this land of inequality, there is no accountability of the wealthy and influential, who are, in fact, given a free pass after every atrocity they commit. When everyone thinks that exceptions can be made in the prohibition of child labour, tacit acceptance is created in society for this scourge: the children of the poor are seen as fair game when it comes to wanting things done very cheaply.The persistence of child labour and child exploitation in Pakistan is a moral issue. Despite all the commitments to goodness and charity and being faithful Muslims, people simply do not think that exploiting children is a condemnable act. This is why, even as we see children being beaten up, forced into begging, and kicked around in front of our very own eyes we do not raise our voices or punish the culprits.This extends to law enforcement and other government institutions that, too, look the other way when they should be catching and imprisoning the perpetrators, however rich and powerful.Everyone likes to condemn evil practices in theory but then they stay quiet and are, in fact, complicit in their perpetuation. Collectively, this is a moral indictment of an entire country, and reveals a deep ethical bankruptcy that sees little wrong in the failure to protect the most helpless and vulnerable in society.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nWhen it arrives, it can bring both bounty and bane. However, due to a changing climate, monsoons in recent times have invariably resulted in more hardship than help. This monsoon, which arrived in Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual date, will certainly buoy farmers and provide much-needed relief from the blistering heat, but concerns over its severity still loom large. Experts have predicted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures. As this will exacerbate floods, landslides and epidemics, disaster preparedness becomes crucial.Our responses to natural disasters have consistently fallen short. Governments come and go, but the same pattern repeats every year, and hundreds of lives, and a whole lot of properties and physical infrastructure are left at nature’s mercy. Not that the country has no plans and policies for disaster preparedness. This year, as in previous ones, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has devised the Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan, which is commendable. The necessary logistics and emergency relief materials have also been stockpiled in all provinces, according to officials. The problem, however, is with the execution of these plans. This monsoon is estimated to put 1.81 million people and 412,000 households at risk, and require 18,000 rescues. These numbers are large, suggesting the necessity for a comprehensive response to disasters and ensuring that relief programmes reach the most vulnerable and needy. Lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels has also caused several problems during disasters. Local governments play a big role as primary rescuers in floods and landslides, but they are still far short in human and financial resources. The examples from the earthquake-devastated Rukum West, Sindhupalchowk and several other places highlight how Nepal fails to rehabilitate the disaster-displaced people for long periods. The residents of Rukum West are still obliged to live in houses with cracks and fissures, and experts warn that these houses could be badly damaged this monsoon. There is also high risk to those living in high landslide and flood prone areas. Unless we design approaches that include not only immediate relief programmes but also year-round relocation, rehabilitation, monitoring and study, people will continue to suffer. Also, proactive measures like public awareness and early warning should be strengthened.Moreover, monsoons are notorious for water- and vector-borne diseases, including dengue, cholera and typhoid. Dengue cases are already being reported from different parts of the country and the caseload will likely increase during and after the monsoon. Water resource contamination has surged in the past few months, leading to a higher number of water-borne disease cases in hospitals. During the monsoon preparedness, the authorities shouldn’t overlook these epidemics and focus particularly on areas that are more prone to diseases and, therefore, need timely healthcare intervention and workers.A coordinated effort from health, home, urban development and water supply ministries can help make this monsoon a lot safer. In the long run, we should find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, which has exacerbated our climatic conditions and intensified disasters. Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on weather will help us better prepare for future monsoons and the disasters that come in their wake.  \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel highlighted the importance of social justice for inclusive economic development on Thursday.Addressing the inaugural forum of the Global Coalition for Social Justice of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, Paudel said that sustainable peace could be achieved through shared prosperity, further urging the international community to mobilise resources to realise the same.“A significant amount of money that should be spent on development is being invested in deadly weapons. The international community should reverse this path and mobilise resources for the prosperity of humanity,” the President said. “Sustainable peace can be achieved through shared prosperity and a sense of global brotherhood, not through weapons.”President Paudel also reflected on the importance of adapting to new workplace challenges and the need for peace to underpin development.Nepal has embraced new challenges such as the digital economy, care economy and gig economy and is committed to implementing the ‘Decent Work Agenda’, he said.“For that, we must prepare ourselves for new jobs, learn new skills, and adapt to new workplaces.” The President is currently on a weeklong visit to Switzerland and Germany. He and his delegation reached Geneva via Qatar on Tuesday.On Wednesday, he met with President of the Swiss Confederation Viola Amherd and discussed issues of bilateral interest.On Saturday, the President and the Nepali delegation will leave for Berlin, Germany. Paudel is scheduled to hold a meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Monday evening. \nThe Special Court handed a sentence of six years to a Lumbini Development Trust employee for corruption on Thursday.A bench of Special Court Chairperson Tek Narayan Kunwar, comprising members Tej Narayan Singh Rai and Ritendra Thapa, convicted the trust’s engineer Saroj Bhattarai for illegally accumulating personal wealth on June 6. On Thursday, he was handed the jail term and a fine of Rs8 million in the case by the court.The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority had filed a case at the Special Court accusing Bhattarai of corruption, on April 7.Among other charges, the corruption watchdog accused him of taking a bribe of Rs8 million from businessman Safik Ahmed, who is the proprietor of one of the construction companies contracted with the trust, through a third person.Ahmed was awarded a contract worth Rs1.22 billion during Bhattarai’s tenure as the trust’s head of the planning section in 2018/19.Bhattari used the amount to buy two different pieces of land, spanning over 2 ropani 9ana and 2ana and 1paisa respectively, in Gundu of Bhaktapur in his mother Janak Nandini Bhattarai’s name.The mother, who was also a defendant in the case, was acquitted of the charges. \nWeeks of scarce rainfall in parts of China, coupled with sweltering heat, has brought drought to several provinces, prompting alerts and actions from authorities to minimise impacts on agriculture, and water and energy supplies.Temperatures this week are forecast to scale record highs in parts of China as countries across Asia brace themselves for another summer of extreme weather.China's Water Resources Ministry this week launched emergency responses to manage drought on in Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces, indicating various regions in the country spanning the northwest to the east are facing parched and scorching conditions.With dwindling precipitation since May in areas around the Yellow River Basin, in combination with the onset of searing temperatures this month, drought is threatening cultivated land that were being prepared to be sown as well as sown crops, Xinhua reported.The harsh weather conditions will feature until the end of next week, with drought expected to worsen, the official media said.In some parts of Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces, temperatures could reach 44 degrees Celsius (111.2 degrees Fahrenheit), potentially breaking historical records for the month of June, state broadcaster CCTV said.Surface temperatures could hit 70 C in some localities including in Shanxi and Shaanxi, it added.The emergency management ministry has alerted affected regions including northwestern Shaanxi, northern Hebei and Shanxi, eastern Anhui and Shandong as well as central Henan to protect water and food production.China's national forecaster predicted continuous heat wave conditions and warned about the need to prepare for emergency power supplies as well as fire prevention in forest areas, the People's Daily reported.Electricity demand typically soars in high temperatures as people crank up the air-conditioning to stay cool.Rain, not heat, is the threat in southern China. Coastal Fujian's provincial observatory raised a warning for wet weather and potential disasters after forecasting heavy rainfall until Saturday. \n Group of Seven (G7) leaders start their annual summit on Thursday looking to double down on support for Ukraine in its war with Russia and offer a united face in confronting China’s political and economic ambitions.With the Middle East, migration and artificial intelligence (AI) also on a packed agenda, the June 13-15 summit in southern Italy would be taxing for leaders at the best of times, but most of them are also bowed down by their own domestic woes.US President Joe Biden, facing a tough re-election bid in November, arrived in Italy the day after his son Hunter Biden was convicted of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak appears destined to lose power in a July 4 election, the leaders of France and Germany are reeling from political defeats, and opinion polls are bleak for the prime ministers of Canada and Japan.Only the host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, is riding high after triumphing in Italy’s European election last weekend, but achieving meaningful results in the luxury Borgo Egnazia hotel resort will be a tall order.Determined to claim the initiative, the G7 leaders look likely to announce they have agreed on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from frozen Russian assets to back the multi-year debt package.However officials acknowledge the plan is complex, meaning any deal will only be in principle, with legal experts still having to thrash out the details that will need the backing of European nations, particularly Belgium, which is not in the G7.For a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the summit and is due to sign a new, long-term security accord with Biden.“By signing this we’ll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If (Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he’s wrong,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.Confronting chinaUnderscoring US determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.By announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.The European Commission told automakers on Wednesday it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese electric cars from July, less than a month after Washington quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100%.While G7 leaders are expected to express concern over high Chinese production levels, which they say disrupt global supply chains and market stability, EU diplomats warn that Europe is anxious to avoid a full-blown trade war with Beijing.Eager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including Pope Francis, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on both the risks and potential of AI.Among those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.Although the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a final news conference from Meloni. \nOn Thursday, the weather will be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province, along with the hilly regions of Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province.According to the Metrological Forecasting Division, it will be partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country.It said light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places in Koshi and hilly regions in Bagmati and Gandaki and at one or two places in the rest of the country.Tonight, it will be partly cloudy to generally cloudy in Koshi Province, along with the hilly regions in Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province, and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country.The met office said light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning, and gusty wind is likely to occur at a few places in Koshi and hilly regions in Bagmati and Gandaki and at one or two places in the rest of the country.On Wednesday, Dhangadhi experienced the warmest day in the country, with temperatures rising to 43.9 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature in Jumla was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius. \nCandid and confident, Shreeya Giri founded the digital mental health platform Happy Minds. For this initiative, she was named in the prestigious Forbes magazine’s 30 under 30, 2024 edition, under the social impact category.An advocate of mental health, Giri believes in immersing oneself in the journey of self-betterment. Bonding over judging books by their covers and discussing intriguing mental health reads in an interview with the Post’s Anusha Dhakal, Giri shares her love for the self-help genre and how books helped her grow as a person.What do you recall as the first book you ever read?I started reading after my bachelor’s. My first read was ‘The Path of Least Resistance’, which a close friend gifted me after graduation. My friend knew I was facing dilemmas about what I wanted to do with my life, so this book is special to me because it is so precious that I can't bring myself to let people borrow it.Have you ever come across a book that changed you or impacted you immensely?‘Think Like a Monk’ by Jay Shetty means a lot to me. I brought it back from London during what I recall as the most difficult time. During this period, I was deeply entangled in negative cycles. I would look into the mirror and only see my dark circles, my hair, and my body, and only think about how much I disliked my appearance. I often wondered why people drained me so much and so often.While reading the book, I felt as if it was written for me. It teaches you to reconstruct your thinking into more positive patterns. Another key takeaway for me was the importance of gratitude. It’s easy to be grateful towards nature or God, but we are seldom grateful towards ourselves. After reading this book, I have been practising self-gratitude.I don’t consider myself a religious person because, growing up, religion felt like it demanded faith without explanation. Interestingly, I was introduced to the word “dharma” through this book. I understood that the true purpose of life is to self-love without expectations. Shetty makes an intriguing distinction in the book between a monk’s mind and a monkey's mind. At my lowest point, I had a monkey mind, blaming everyone but myself for my circumstances, which filled me with negative energy. Eventually, I began letting go of such energy.Looking back, all of the suffering and rejections make sense. Without them, I wouldn’t be here at Happy Minds, doing what I do. I know Jay Shetty is a controversial figure, but I believe there’s always something to learn from someone. I am a believer in separating the art from the artist.Do you think storytelling plays a role in healing?It plays a huge role, actually, both personally and collectively. After my Forbes feature, I was invited to give long-form interviews, during which I shared my life experiences with the utmost vulnerability. Organically, through media coverage of my story, more than 120 people signed up for therapy at Happy Minds.This alone is proof that storytelling possesses a unique power to make people feel seen and seek help. Have you ever considered writing a book of your own, perhaps in the self-help genre? As you are more connected to this category.Yes, I have considered it. My friend and I were planning to do so, but I had to drop out due to my poor mental health at the time. She went on to publish a book on feminine energy, which someone stole from the office. Isn’t that amazing? It was so good that someone stole it—what a compliment.If I were to write a book, it would be on psychology and well-being. I have a lot to share about my story. I’ve noticed that telling my story through public speaking and interview formats feels too limiting, so I think I will write a book highlighting my life experiences, which hopefully reaches more people.Is there a book you recommend to your colleagues and clients at Happy Minds?I frequently recommend ‘Maybe You Should Talk to Someone’. However, I couldn’t finish it because it was very triggering. The book, written by a therapist, offers insights into the frameworks therapists use and how they perceive their clients’ opinions and experiences. It’s a very interesting book, revealing the kinds of conversations therapists encounter during therapy sessions.There is a fascinating part in the book where a therapist is conversing with a convicted murderer. In the conversation, it appears that the person committed the act in a brief, emotionally charged moment. As the conversation progresses, it becomes evident that this person is very emotional and intuitive, almost a good person. It might be jarring for some to think about how a murderer could seem good, but the book provides an interesting perspective: that humans are neither wholly good nor wholly bad.I’ve also often contemplated the challenges faced by therapists, particularly their ability to shoulder not only the burdens of their clients but also their own. Does the book discuss how therapists maintain this delicate balance, continuously listening to others while managing their life challenges?It does, actually. Therapists are also people; they carry their past and their traumas. Sometimes, a client’s story can reflect the therapist’s personal experiences or traumas. This raises a question: Are therapists in a position to set boundaries when something like this happens? The book discusses this situation.Therapy has steps, the first of which is assessment, where we examine the client’s case history. This helps us understand the client’s story and expectations. Therapists should recognise that the client’s story is separate from their own.This is why we request a case history at Happy Minds before assigning a client to a therapist. Similarly, having a similar life experience to a client doesn’t mean you shouldn’t see the client.Is there a book that has increased your self-awareness and self-knowledge?‘The Body Keeps the Score’ is a book that has increased my self-knowledge. Through this book, I learnt something that was almost a revelation. This book talks about how your brain, as a defence mechanism, erases your memory post-trauma.This book helps you sit down and self-reflect, reviving your memories by connecting the dots. Hypnotherapy has also been useful in this endeavour. Through this process, I have been able to recover many childhood memories. To be honest, my childhood was not entirely bad, and I can now recollect the good memories as well.Shreeya Giri’s book recommendationsEmbodying Feminine EnergyAuthor: Maria TomanPublisher: Independently publishedYear: 2022‘Embodying Feminine Energy’ is about building yourself as a magnetic force that attracts positivity and exploring best practices for recovering mentally, emotionally, and physically from trauma.The Body Keeps the ScoreAuthor: Bessel Van Der KolkPublisher: Penguin BooksYear: 2014Kolk’s book helps you understand how trauma might be affecting the way you see yourself, respond to experiences, and react to them.

However, the districts of Koshi province have been spared from this scorching weather.Several weather stations, including those at Changunarayan Bhaktapur, Chautara of Sindhupalchok, Tikapur of Kailali, Dharan of Sunsari, and Sarlahi, broke all previous records of maximum temperatures this year.Temperatures exceeding 33 degrees Celsius over the past several days have made life difficult in the Kathmandu valley, with many residents complaining about the heat.On Wednesday, the temperature climbed to 34.3 degrees Celsius in Kathmandu. Met officials said that hot and dry conditions will continue for the next couple of days, as monsoon rains are not expected to arrive in the Valley anytime soon.“Monsoon rain is a must for the Valley to cool down, but it is unlikely to arrive in the next two days,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecasting Division. “Temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius for several days have made the Valley hotter.”According to the Met Department data, the weather station at Changunarayan in Bhaktapur recorded 34.4 degrees Celsius on May 31, the highest temperature ever recorded here. Kathmandu had recorded 36.6 degrees Celsius on May 7, 1989. Tikapur of Kailali recorded 45.2 degrees Celsius on May 30, the highest temperature in the country this year. Likewise, Dharan recorded 40 degrees Celsius on April 28, and Sarlahi recorded 43 degrees Celsius; both are the highest temperatures recorded for those places, according to the Met department.Monsoon clouds entered the country from eastern Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Since then, districts of eastern Nepal have been witnessing rainfall. Met officials say it used to take two days for the monsoon clouds to arrive in the Valley after their arrival in eastern Nepal and around a week to spread throughout the country. However, last year, it took some three weeks for rainfall to occur in western and far-western Nepal.“Due to climate change, the weather has become more unpredictable,” said Manandhar. “The monsoon that entered eastern Nepal two days ago should have reached the Valley by Wednesday, but it may take a few more days.”The Met Office issued a heat wave warning for western and farwestern Tarai following the onset of monsoon. Officials said that they may have to issue more such warnings in the coming days due to the slow progression of the monsoon towards the western parts of the country.“It is not possible to come out in the afternoon due to the extreme heatwave conditions,” Dr Sanket Kumar Risal, information officer at Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, told the Post over the phone. “The hospital is also packed with patients suffering from fever and water-borne diseases. Even groundwater sources are shrinking in our areas. It now takes several hours for the water tank to fill up, which previously took just an hour.” On Wednesday Dhangadhi recorded 43.9 degrees Celsius, followed by Nepalgunj (42.2°C), Birendranagar (41.1 °C), Bhairahawa (40.4 °C), Ghorahi (39.5°C), and Dipayal (40.8 °C). The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. Last year, it started on June 14, one day later than the normal onset day. A normal monsoon, supported by the timely arrival of rain, translates into favourable agricultural production, mainly of paddy, and is further linked with the country’s overall economic growth.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.The Met Office has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events, such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.The department’s climate section has forecast weather conditions for four months (June to September). It said most parts of the country are likely to experience above-average minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall due to weakened El Nino conditions, and the development of La Nina conditions.El Nino conditions are the climatic patterns in which the surface water warms, unusually.The opposite, the cooling of the ocean surface, happens in the La Nina conditions.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average of a rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short time, continuous rain for several days post-monsoon, dry spells and droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal temperatures in winter—have become more frequent in Nepal. \nARIES (March 21-April 19) Self-talk plays a major role in your healing today.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak. \nOn February 7, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government to allow the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding its legal ownership ceiling with plots in any other place within the Koshi Province.With the Supreme Court issuing its full text of the verdict on May 11, opposition party leaders have started questioning the CPN-UML about “policy corruption” committed in the process.The Nepali Congress leaders have demanded a probe into the Oli government’s decision. Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.“No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,” said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill. Some of its lawmakers like Radheshyam Adhikari had criticised it strongly in the Upper House. However, it wasn't objected to by the Congress while endorsing it.Experts say this is an example of how laws are passed in Nepal. The executive includes provisions that allow for policy corruption, and these are endorsed as lawmakers do not care to engage in a thorough study and deliberations over the bill.“Policy corruption at the executive level can be checked if the lawmakers are vigilant and lawmaking is transparent,” Khimlal Devkota, a former National Assembly member who has closely studied Nepal’s law-making process, told the Post.Policy decisions in Nepal have become rather controversial. Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House.Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. “The lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.“The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.”Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process. Talking to law students on Sunday, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri said the government was creating a Suggestion Bank to receive feedback on bills. “Such feedback and suggestions will be incorporated in the bills,” he said. \nThe collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress. In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  \nAfter three years of halt, the much-awaited 5G frequency is set to be auctioned in Nepal.“The telecom regulator is ready to allow 5G frequency, and we are waiting for service providers’ response,” said Pradip Paudyal, deputy director of Nepal Telecommunications Authority.Paudyal, however, didn’t mention the auction date.“We have decided to auction the 5G frequency and are preparing for it,” he said.Paudyal said that to take part in the auction, service providers should clear all the dues they owe to the government.5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology, offers 10 times faster internet speed than its predecessor 4G and supports 10 times more devices per square kilometre.The state-owned phone company has announced several launch dates, but they have always been postponed for no apparent reason.The 5G rollout was originally planned in 2021 but came to an abrupt halt, which insiders said was due to geopolitics.American and Indian embassies’ officials recently told the Post that they were concerned about the Nepal government allowing the Chinese companies to conduct the 5G tests without going through a competitive bidding process.Nepal Telecom has also been saying that there aren’t enough 5G compatible phones in Kathmandu and other cities to warrant launching the new technology. But records show that millions of mobile phones with advanced features have been imported in the past two years.The rollout plan has been revived after the formation of the new government, which, according to insiders, is close to its northern neighbour, China, which has installed and supplied 5G equipment.“We introduced the new frequency policy around four months ago. Under this policy, all frequencies will go into technology neutrality from the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25,” said Paudyal. Technology neutrality allows service providers to use any technology in a given frequency, he said.Currently, there are two telecom service providers operating in the country—Telecom and Ncell.According to the telecom regulator, service providers can introduce 5G technology using existing frequencies or new ones. The authority says it is prepared to provide new frequencies through auction. Nepal Telecom was provided with a 2,600 Mhz frequency for the 5G trial. The authority provided the frequency for a year, and Nepal Telecom conducted an internal trial for around 2-3 months last October. It was said that Nepal Telecom would conduct a trial among the public, but that wasn’t meant to be. The regulator has written to Nepal Telecom to submit a report on the 5G trial.“Once it receives the report, the authority will proceed accordingly,” Paudyal said.While the government said it is ready to introduce 5G technology, the service providers said that since building the 5G ecosystem requires huge investment and as the country’s current economic situation is not so good, the market is not ready for the new mobile technology.It is estimated that service providers need to invest around Rs50-60 billion to implement 5G technology. Both the market and consumers are not ready for the technology, and there are device constraints, too.According to service providers, though mobile phone users’ demands have been growing in Nepal, daily data usage remains very low. Only two out of 10 Nepalis use mobile data regularly, according to Ncell, the private telecom provider.Ncell said in a recent statement that the average monthly data consumption per customer is only 4GB, which is low compared to other neighbouring countries.The telecom service providers are losing money and have outstanding dues due to the reduction in income.When Ncell introduced 4G in 2017, its annual income was Rs58-59 billion, which has now declined to Rs33-35 billion.Similarly, Nepal Telecom’s profit declined to Rs7.8 billion in the last fiscal year from Rs15.01 billion in 2017. According to a report by Cable.co.uk, the mobile data price measured from June to September 2023 is $0.43, or Rs57.38. The average cost of 1GB of data in India is $0.16, $0.12 in Pakistan, $0.23 in Bangladesh, $0.25 in Sri Lanka, $0.71 in Bhutan, and $2.16 in the Maldives. Mobile data prices are expensive in Nepal compared to other South Asian countries.Nepal Telecom concluded the 5G trial in four places in certain mobile sets to check whether the technology supports our network, said Hari Dhakal, spokesperson of Nepal Telecom.“As it requires a huge investment to bring the technology, we need to look at the cost, market readiness, return and other factors. So it will be difficult for us to go to the public immediately and we will not bring it unless we are assured of all the factors.”Jabbor Kayumov, CEO of Ncell, told a recent press meeting that after India, Ncell was looking to make Nepal the first country in South Asia to introduce 5G commercially. “But to get there, we need to take an important first step, and that is we need every Nepali to start using their mobile phones productively which means keeping mobile data always on.”Also, the government needs to create favourable conditions and reform laws to bring the new technology, company insiders say.For instance, a case involving Nepal Telecom and Ncell is under the court’s consideration. The government is forcefully asking telecom service providers to clear the frequency amount before the auction of 2,100 Mhz by bringing retrospective law, insiders say.3G was introduced in Nepal in 2007 and 4G in 2017.After the government announced an ‘economic decade’, digital economy topics are coming to the fore. “For a digital economy, digital transformation is necessary, which in turn calls for 5G technology. This is why the government has prioritised 5G,” Paudyal said. According to the 61st annual report of the Auditor General, Nepal Telecom spent Rs18.43 million for the trial of 5G in the current fiscal year. The audit has suggested that the company needs to be more effective in the implementation of 5G technology. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nSiddhartha Art Gallery felt quite different last Saturday. With the sweltering heat in Kathmandu, you might think it was the glare of the sun, but it was more about the joyful energy of the ‘Nepal Pride Parade’. The gallery, which is usually adorned with huge canvas frames and majestic pieces of art, with paintings from traditional to abstract, had way smaller photo frames lined up. The photo frames looked too simple, with ordinary pictures.One might have speculated whether the photos were captured by skilled professionals or if they were groundbreaking shots taken by daring photographers or investigative journalists, given that they were intended for an exhibition. However, from a single look, it could be seen that the photos were taken by no experts, just ordinary people. Yet, when one looked at them, they couldn’t take their eyes off them, for these photos captured the everyday lives of rural trans women—a group often forgotten and overlooked because of the dominant mainstream focus on the urban, upper-class LGBTQIA+ community.Blue Diamond Society (BDS), a pioneering organisation advocating for sexual and gender minorities in Nepal, organised a two-day photovoice exhibit titled ‘Sweekar’ from June 8 to June 9 at the Siddhartha Art Gallery, Babermahal Revisited, Kathmandu. This exhibit, coinciding with Pride Month and the Nepal Pride Parade, showcased the stories of rural transgender women from Madhesh Province, Nepal. Through 15-20 compelling photographs, selected and narrated by the women themselves, the exhibit provided a glimpse into their lived experiences and the intersectional stigma they face regarding gender identity and HIV healthcare.According to the organisers, ‘Sweekar’, meaning acceptance, is a multi-prong effort to examine and address the intersectional stigma experienced by trans women living in Madhesh Province. Photovoice, a method designed to spark verbal discussions on significant community issues, has been widely utilised in health education. Fifteen trans women were invited to participate in two three-day photovoice workshops in Janakpur. They worked with a trained facilitator to learn how to use photography to share their lived experiences of stigma. In the second workshop, the facilitator reviewed hundreds of photos with the participants and distilled them down to the photos exhibited, which represented the issues most important to trans women.Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society, stated, “This is not a typical photo exhibition to be viewed from an artistic perspective. We are not romanticising the pain and struggles of the trans community. These are their unheard stories and hidden pain. Through this exhibit, we aim to provide a platform for trans women to share their challenges and progress”.True to Dhakal’s sentiment, the photos revealed the lives and struggles of rural trans women in Madhesh. Each photo was accompanied by short quotes from the women, adding depth and meaning. For the first time in my experience at an art gallery, there was no artist's perspective, only the raw, unfiltered voices of the people depicted. One photo showed a trans woman carrying a bag on her head, with a quote, “Heading to India for a performance. Walking because public vehicles wouldn’t let me board.” Another showed a trans woman carrying a milk pot with the quote, “People hesitate to buy milk from me because I'm queer. It’s hard to survive.”Likewise, another photo showed a trans woman in a sari with torn clothes, accompanied by the quote, “When we go to the market, people tear our clothes, they don’t respect us, sometimes they rape.”The phrase “sometimes they rape” was used so casually, yet it starkly depicts the harsh reality faced by trans women, who have become so vulnerable and accustomed to violence like harassment and rape that they speak of it lightly. For me, “sometimes” had always been associated with trivial activities like “sometimes I sing”, “sometimes I go climbing”, or “sometimes I write”, but hearing “sometimes they rape” was shocking and took on a new heavy meaning. Through the photos, the audience could see the vulnerable realities of trans women in rural areas. Even research indicates that rural transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) populations have a greater need for health services compared to their urban counterparts. They face unique barriers to accessing these services, and their health disparities are less researched than those of urban TGD populations.Another study shows that trans women in Nepal are highly stigmatised, leading to factors that increase their risk for HIV. Interventions are needed to support the economic and mental well-being of trans women to mitigate the heightened HIV risk from stigma. However, the healthcare systems and acceptance are lacking.Pinky Gurung, president of BDS, opined, “Through this, we aim to educate the general public, policymakers, and stakeholders about the realities faced by trans women in Nepal and advocate against the anti-gender movement.”The exhibit also featured a video collage of the daily lives of trans women. It showed how trans women are like any other people who wish to have ordinary lives but are forced to endure difficult lives due to societal stigma. It also showcased rare instances where trans women received necessary help and healthcare, offering hope for a more positive and accepting society.The exhibit's standout feature was that the photos were taken by trans women themselves, adding authenticity and a personal connection to their daily lives.The ‘Sweekar’ photovoice exhibit celebrates the achievements of the LGBTQIA+ community and underscores the need for continued action towards inclusivity and better health outcomes for all, especially trans women.Dr Erin Wilson, principal investigator of Sweekar, said, “Through photovoice, a participatory research method promoting critical self-awareness within social contexts, we hope to empower individuals to challenge stereotypes and reduce stigma towards trans women and HIV in Nepal while boosting empowerment and social support.”The exhibit moved to Janakpur on Monday and was presented yesterday at Mithila Yatri Niwas, Janakpur, from 12 pm onwards. Those who missed it in Kathmandu can visit the Sweekar website to view the photos and narrations. \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, is set for its Unity General Convention, which will commence on Monday in Janakpur, a month after the party suffered a split.The federal chair of the JSP-Nepal, Ashok Rai, along with seven federal lawmakers and 30 central committee members, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party.The party split was more visible at the centre, but it is said to have had a lesser impact on Yadav’s faction in the province so far.Party insiders say the dissidents in provincial assemblies and party committees couldn’t get organised to form new committees as the registration of the new party at the election commission was immediately challenged in the Supreme Court. The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit.Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support.Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7.Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation.“The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.”Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari.“Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said.This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections.The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the parties in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990.Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically.The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention.The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April.The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention. The party's foreign affairs department chief, Arjun Thapa, said delegates from India, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Indonesia have already arrived in Nepal.Invitations have been extended to various parties, except the Janata Samajbadi Party led by Ashok Rai, which splintered from the JSP-Nepal. The Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) are other parties that will participate in the Janakpur convention. Party leaders say the opening ceremony will be held on Monday, whereas the closed session, which will discuss the party’s political documents, is scheduled for the subsequent days. \nNepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa has joined the group of leaders calling for a constitutional amendment in order to address the underperforming provincial system and the political instability allegedly caused by the mixed electoral system the country constitutionally endorsed nearly a decade ago. After a change in coalition at the centre began to affect provincial governments, voices for reforming the electoral system through constitutional amendment are growing louder. Speaking at a programme in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, a general secretary of the largest party in the House of Representatives, argued that reforming the electoral system had become necessary to ensure political stability. He also said that the provinces’ performance so far shows that the federal system cannot be sustained in its current form. “By reform in the provincial structure, I do not mean scrapping the federal system altogether, which the country cannot afford,” Thapa told the Post when asked to explain his statement. “The issue of governments’ formation in the provinces has been challenged in court. This is a result of lack of clarity on provincial government formation in the constitution.”The government formation process in Koshi and Gandaki provinces have been challenged multiple times, and the Supreme Court has many times invalidated the chief ministerial appointment and election processes in the two provinces.Questions have been raised over the expenditures for running the provincial governments. “To address this issue, we need to downsize the elected representatives’ bodies not only in the provinces but also at the federal level. For that, we need constitutional reform,” Thapa added. “We bear a collective responsibility to protect and sustain the constitution. This, however, requires some amendments. Reform in the electoral system is as important,” Thapa emphasised. The provinces followed the same process of government formation practised at the centre and that caused problems, he said. Thapa stressed that amendments to the constitution could address all these issues.The Congress leader says it is wrong to advocate either for scrapping the federal system altogether or and fully retaining the constitutional provisions on the provinces. The Rastriya Prajantara Party, which bats for the revival of the Hindu Kingdom, has been demanding the scrapping of the country’s federal structure. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which was formed two years ago, also wants the provincial structure overhauled. The new party says it wants to downsize the middle layer of the federal system. The party hasn’t participated in the provincial elections.Former National Assembly member Khim Lal Devkota, who is also an expert on federalism and a columnist at The Post, sees a slim chance of any changes in the federal system even though “it is necessary”.“I have closely worked with Nepal’s top political leaders. I believe they won’t readily amend the constitution,” Devkota told the Post. “The longer we take to amend the constitution, the more questions there will be on the longevity of the constitution.” During the Congress Mahasamiti meeting held in February, many leaders raised their voices in favour of filling all seats of the lower house of the federal parliament through direct election. Instead of electing a section of the lower house under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, the leaders had suggested that the upper house of the parliament be filled exclusively through the PR system. They were of the view that Nepal would not have a stable government unless all the lower house members were directly elected by their constituencies.Devkota is also of the opinion that Nepal needs to reform the election system. The mixed electoral system should be changed to create an environment for political instability, he said.In the 275-strong federal lower house, 165 are directly elected, whereas 110 come from the PR category. The upper chamber has 59 members. Of them, 56 are chosen through an electoral college comprising provincial assembly members and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units. Each province elects eight members, while three are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.Likewise, among the 550 members in the seven provincial assemblies, 220 are elected under the PR category. This number is large compared to the population size and thus needs to be reduced significantly, say experts.However, Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, blames the political leaders for the current problems of the provinces. Top politicians are using provincial governments and assemblies to place their second- and third-tier leaders. This has burdened the state without yielding any tangible results, he added. Pokharel says this represents a failure of the leadership rather than the federal system.Since the inception of the provincial system, political parties have appointed chief ministers on a rotational basis, Pokharel told the Post. “It is true that there are operational problems in the provinces, but leaders are more responsible for this than the system.” Even though the state structure is federal, political parties have yet to adopt the three-tier system within their organisations, he said. “What stops the political parties from giving autonomy to their provincial committees and letting them make decisions regarding the provinces on their own?” Pokharel questioned.Devkota, however, said two models should be considered to ensure the stability of provincial governments.The first involves distributing the government leadership positions based on the number of seats won in the election, and the second concerns implementing provisions similar to those at the local government level. According to the first model, the chief minister and other positions are distributed based on the number of seats shared in the provincial assembly elections, and the government is run among the constituent parties on a consensus basis.As per the second method, the chief minister is directly elected by voters, similar to the election of mayors or chairs at the local units. This makes the chief ministers fully accountable to the people. The chief minister can be removed by a two-thirds majority of the provincial assembly, thus preventing one from being an autocrat. One of the major concerns is the destabilising linkage of provincial politics with the power equation in Kathmandu. When the coalition at the centre changes, governments in the provinces also change.The subnational governments changed immediately after the change in coalition partners in Kathmandu on March 4. When Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed ruling partners, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, CPN-UML, joined the government while the largest force, the Congress, was ousted from power. The changes at the centre immediately triggered changes in the provinces as well. \nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Technology on Friday made public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli.Unveiling the report that Oli and his successors had kept under wraps was one of Sumana Shrestha's priorities as minister for education, science, and technology. Following her request, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal handed the report to the ministry on Monday.Shrestha consulted the commission members on Thursday. The ministry stated that the report’s recommendations will be implemented under Dahal’s leadership.The statement quoted Shrestha as saying, \"The government will implement positive and contextual suggestions.\"In August 2018, the government formed a 25-member commission led by Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. It involved education experts, representatives from teachers’ and private schools’ associations, and officials in the task of recommending the government on its education policy.The commission prepared the report after rigorous discussions and consultations with the stakeholders. On January 15, 2019, it was submitted to Oli. However, Oli was not interested in implementing the recommendations, so he never made the report public. His successor, Sher Bahadur Deuba, also followed suit.The commission has recommended that private schools be converted into “trusts” within 10 years. This would, according to the commission, stop the commercialisation of education. Conversion into trust means that the school owners cannot distribute their profits. Currently, most of the private schools operate as companies after getting registered in the Company Registrar's Office.The commission, according to its members, made its recommendations based on Article 31(2) of the constitution, which makes the state responsible for ensuring compulsory basic and free secondary education for all. The commission said that leaving private educators to “generate profit”, as they are doing at present, would be tantamount to a breach of the constitution.The private school operators objected to the provision. They had tried to pressure the commission to exclude it as the report was being finalised.Usha Jha, a member of the commission, said there was immense pressure from the private schools to keep the report unpublished.\"We worked really hard to prepare the report. All the recommendations aim to improve the country's education system,\" Jha told the Post. \"The education minister took a bold step to make the report public. I believe it gets implemented. In fact, the minister is already following the spirit of the commission's report.\" As the Oli government kept the report secret, a majority of members of the committee shared it with the media in December 2020. The National Campaign for Education, an umbrella body of over 400 organisations working in the education sector, had printed the report and distributed it at an event.However, the report coming out of the ministry holds a different meaning—that the government owns it, said Jha.The commission recommended that the government facilitate private sector investment in higher education and bring school education gradually under the government’s ambit. It also suggested partnerships between private and public schools to improve the latter’s quality.Hiring head teachers on contract after evaluating their performance, increasing education budget to at least 20 percent of the government’s spending as per its commitment and ensuring that every child gets basic education in his/her mother tongue are other major recommendations of the commission.Despite Nepal’s global commitment, the proportion of the national budget allocated to the education sector has been declining. The share of the education budget, which once amounted to 17 percent, is now down to 11 percent.Allocating at least 20 percent of the national budget, or 6.5 percent of the national GDP, to education is considered the global norm.Several commissions have been formed to recommend educational reforms over the past decades. However, most of the reports remain unimplemented. The Pokharel-led commission was the sixth formed since 1955 and third after the restoration of democracy in 1950 to look into matters concerning education. \nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nNepali Congress lawmakers back Mayor Shah's sidewalk expansion plan, escalating a conflict with UML over federal-local government jurisdictions sparked by Shah's allegations against UML chair Oli in a failed land swap bid.\nBodies of a woman and an unidentified man were discovered at the bottom of a cliff in Dakshinkali, likely victims of a motorcycle accident.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City initiates Sisdole road repairs in preparation for monsoon, aiming to prevent garbage disposal disruptions, considering leachate control measures and source waste segregation.\nA man attempted self-immolation in Kathmandu after allegedly setting his own family on fire on Tuesday.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Keshav Thebe, 55-year-old Chanchal Bahadur Singh, who was in an inebriated state, sprinkled kerosene over his wife Bindu, and their three daughters, aged 24, 16 and eight, and set them on fire in Saraswatinagar of Chabahil.Singh then attempted self-immolation, police said.All of them have been admitted to the Kirtipur Hospital for treatment.The 24-year-old and the teenager have been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as they have sustained 55 percent and 80 percent burns to their bodies, respectively.The others have sustained eight to 10 percent burn wounds, the hospital said. \nIn the first ten months of the fiscal year, Nepal's high-value product exports grew moderately, but concerns arise over the country's readiness for LDC graduation with a focus on value chain development, quality improvement, and export incentives review.\nSuman Pandey, a renowned figure in the travel and adventure industry and the president of Explore Himalaya Travel and Adventure, has been appointed as the new vice chairman of the prestigious Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA). Pandey is also the CEO of Fishtail Air, director of Summit Air and Chhaya Centre, president of the Himalaya Academy of Travel and Tourism, and president of Himalayan Pre- Fab Pvt. Ltd. The 73rd PATA Annual General Meeting, held in Bangkok on June 7, announced the ratification of the new PATA Executive Board. Peter Semone, who has served with distinction, has been formally endorsed and will continue to serve as the chairman of the association’s executive board for a second consecutive term, according to the press statement issued by the PATA.Luzi Matzig, chairman of Asian Trails Ltd., has been appointed the new secretary and treasurer of the association.Members of the executive board include Ben Montgomery, director of business relations management at Centara Hotels & Resorts, Thailand; Henry Oh, chairman of Global Tour Ltd., Korea; Noredah Othman, CEO of Sabah Convention Bureau, Malaysia; Mayur Patel, head of Asia at OAG, Singapore; Gerald Perez, vice president of the Guam Visitors Bureau, Guam; and SanJeet, director of DDP Publications Private Limited, India. \nThe government plans to establish a consumer court in the Kathmandu Valley as a pilot in the coming fiscal year 2024-25.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun made the announcement on May 28 while unveiling the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25. He said the necessary funds have been allocated for setting up the court. “The government will tackle issues like black-marketing and market syndicates will be controlled. A consumer court will also be set up, and I have allocated a budget for this purpose,” Pun said while presenting the budget.\"We had sought a budget of Rs10 million to establish at least one consumer court in a district inside the Kathmandu Valley. But we have yet to know how much has been allocated. The proposed Rs10 million will cover administrative and employment expenses of the court,\" said an official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, wishing not to be named. \"We aim to establish the court in the coming fiscal year.\"The Consumer Protection Act, 2018 has a provision requiring the government to establish a consumer court. Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies submitted a draft of legislation to the law ministry in September 2019. Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. However, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in the government.Last year, the Industry Ministry cancelled the previous process and started a fresh process by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in an appropriate location within the Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the current condition of the country and available resources, the official said. Based on financial resources, more consumer courts will be set up gradually in other districts also, according to officials.The draft report has been submitted to the Law Ministry, which has forwarded it to Judicial Council for its suggestions.According to the proposed draft, the government, in an effort to minimise the financial burden on state coffers, will deploy the district judge and staffers of the respective district to the consumer court, according to the official. “If there is space in the district court, the consumer court will be established there, or else a separate building will be rented for the purpose,” the official said. In September 2019, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies submitted draft legislation to establish a consumer court to the Ministry of Law, which then forwarded it to the Judicial Council. As the process was delayed, the Supreme Court on February 20, 2022 ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated cases of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. But there isn’t any indication yet of such a court being established in any of the country's seven provinces.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up one consumer court per province would not be practical as people will have to travel long distances for their cases, so the draft has proposed setting up consumer courts in each district gradually. A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers do not want to get involved in complex court cases, particularly at the Supreme Court, this has emboldened unscrupulous traders, observers say. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier and there will be fewer hassles.Consumer rights activists said that they are hopeful that the government will follow through on its announcement made in the annual budget and set up consumer courts. “With the policies and programmes for upcoming fiscal year 2024-25 mentioning the formation of consumer courts and the government allocating budget for it, we are hopeful that the court will be established in the coming fiscal year despite the long delay,” said Bishnu Prasad Timilsina, the general secretary of the Forum for Consumers' Rights.The Law Minister and Industry Minister have also committed to establishing consumer courts, and the Supreme Court has already issued an order to this effect, therefore it is expected that this time it will be implemented, Timilsina said. “And just setting up the courts alone will not be enough, they have to be effective.”\"Consumer courts need to be digitised so that consumers who have become victims can easily file their cases through applications, ensuring quick processing, and track the proceedings through digital mediums,\" Timilsina said.      \nAt least one case of cholera, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, has been confirmed in Kathmandu.According to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, a 62-year-old man from Makwanpur district, who had been admitted with severe diarrhoea some two weeks ago, tested positive for the deadly disease.The man is said to have been residing in Kathmandu for a long time.“The health condition of the patient was serious when he was brought to our hospital,” said a health worker serving at the Hospital’s Emergency Department, asking not to be named, as the official was not authorised to speak to the media. “The stool test confirmed a cholera infection.”According to health workers at the hospital, Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in stool samples of infected patients.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.The Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak in the monsoon of 2022 in which 77 cholera-positive cases were confirmed. Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.”Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.”Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago. An Indian national who is a truck driver was admitted to the Sukraraj Hospital at that time.“We had mobilised our team to investigate the source of the outbreak,” said Sapkota. Doctors warn that concealing outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and failing to investigate their sources and inform the public about the risks can prove counterproductive, as the deadly bacteria keep spreading in communities if preventative measures are not taken.Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected with them every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main catalysts for the spread of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City that were highly affected by the outbreak. In October 2021, a Vibrio cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu district killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man.Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts failed to curb the infection.The World Health Organisation says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera.A combination of careful survey, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nPost-monsoon is considered the dengue epidemic season. However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death. \nSevere heat in the Tarai region has affected ongoing polio vaccination programmes.Officials at the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services say the immunisation campaign has been affected by school closures due to scorching heat.“The immunisation campaign will resume once schools resume their regular classes,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “It will take more time for the campaign to complete due to the severe heat in Tarai districts.”Several districts’ maximum temperatures have either reached close to or crossed 40 degrees Celsius in the last few days. On Tuesday, Dhangadhi recorded 40.4 degrees Celsius, Nepalgunj 40.2 degrees Celsius and Birendranagar 37.3 degrees Celsius, the Met office’s data shows.Met officials anticipate monsoon will start at the end of next week and bring respite from scorching heat.Over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 are being inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a nationwide immunisation drive started on May 26.Officials said that children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.Gautam said that vaccination programmes are being carried out smoothly in the rest of the places. The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. \nThe 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” \nThe government has allocated Rs86.24 billion to the health sector for the upcoming fiscal year, around a 2.5 percent increase from the 83.99 billion allocated for the current fiscal year.The new allocation is only around 4.6 percent of the total budget.Funds have been allocated to give continuity to most of the ongoing programmes—safe motherhood programmes, free essential medicines, setting up basic health care centres in all wards throughout the country, and financial relief to people from difficult and expensive diseases—cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal failure, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, head and spinal injury, sickle cell anaemia, and stroke. The health budget also includes grants to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal Police Hospital, Nepal Army Hospital, Civil Hospital, and others. The national budget has announced a few new programmes, including the establishment of the Sita Dahal Memorial College of Naturopathy and Yogic Science under Kathmandu University. Sita Dahal is the late wife of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who died in July last year. Health experts said that the incumbent government neglected the health sector this year, too, as a slight increase in the annual budget does not help to continue the existing health programme.“How can we achieve the Sustainable Development Goals targets from the budget allocated to the health care sectors?” said Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, former chief specialist at the Ministry of Health and Population. “We need to bring qualitative change, and for that, huge investments are required.”Several healthcare programmes, including safe motherhood programmes, child health programmes, tuberculosis control, nutrition, vector control programmes, epidemic control, non-communicable diseases, and mental health programmes, have already been affected by the cut in the previous year’s budget.Likewise, the budget doesn't address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases.Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.Nepal has witnessed several outbreaks in recent years—dengue, cholera diarrheal diseases, and other vector-borne diseases. The country has failed to achieve the malaria elimination target.“Every hour, one person commits suicide, the burden of non-communicable diseases has increased alarmingly, and neonatal deaths have not declined in the past several years,” said Shrestha. “Several programmes of health, including a free screening of cervical cancer and renal problems in the state-run health facilities, could not be implemented due to various reasons. The budget allocated for health even does not support continuing the ongoing programmes.”Experts caution that budgetary cuts in crucial healthcare programmes would have a long-term impact and could affect the achievements made over the years.“The government has not allocated the health budget to strengthen the federal structures,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Chand, former chief of the Policy Planning and International Cooperation Division at the Ministry of Health. “Most of the health budget will be spent on the salaries of the staffers.” \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nNepal can finally breathe a sigh of relief and will have at least something to cheer for when they return home from Saudi Arabia—thanks to a spirited battle against a strong Yemen.The Gorkhalis headed into their last Group H game of the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers against Yemen on Tuesday low in confidence after losing all of their previous five matches, with their most recent embarrassment coming in a 4-0 drubbing by group winners United Arab Emirates last week.Vincenzo Alberto Annese’s men had conceded 18 goals in five qualifiers matches, scoring none in reply.Nepal’s dismal qualifiers campaign was also partly contributed by the sheer negligence of sports authorities All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) and National Sports Council whose poor management of the country’s only international standard football venue—Dasharath Stadium—forced Nepal to play their two home matches at neutral venues.However, on Tuesday, they floored Yemen with a dogged fightback until the death after initially falling behind to a ninth minute Nasser Al Gahwashi penalty at the Prince Mohammad bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam, thanks to Sanjeeb Bista and Gillespye Jung Karki whose goals either side of the half time turned things around for Nepal.Although Mohammed Al Dahi’s equaliser in the first minute of stoppage time denied them a first victory of the qualifiers and also a first win against Yemen, their dogged display will still serve as a testament that the youth Nepali squad have a lot of potential.The draw against Yemen will especially wash the burden off the Italian coach Annese whose contract with Nepal is expiring this month.Annese, who was appointed as Nepal head coach in March last year, has been under a sharp knife following a series of disappointing results that also included a draw against minnows Bhutan, disappointing SAFF Championship campaign and World Cup Qualifiers first round struggles against Laos.The 39-year-old coach has been using the exodus of Nepali football stars including Bimal Gharti Magar and Sujal Shrestha to Australia and an inexperienced squad as his defence for Nepal’s poor run of results in the international arena.But he seems to have finally cracked the code in his probably last game with Nepal as coach. And the output against Yemen could possibly convince ANFA to trigger another extension in his contract. ANFA had added a three-month extension in Annese’s contract this year.The emergence of Sanjeeb, who only made his international debut in March this year as an 88th minute substitute during a 5-0 qualifiers loss to Bahrain, is even more promising.Sanjeeb, who played full 90 minutes in Nepal’s 3-0 loss against Bahrain before being benched in 4-0 defeat to the UAE, had a hand in both of Nepal’s goals against Yemen in Dammam.Sanjeeb, who replaced star forward Anjan Bista in the front, first pounced on a misplaced back pass from Radhawan Al Hubaishi and bent the ball past Yemen goalkeeper Mohammed Khairalah to score an equaliser in the 22nd minute.Sanjeeb then received a long pass from Chhiring Lama and served it for Karki to head home Nepal’s second goal in the 66th.It was the first international goals for both Sanjeeb and Karki. Karki made his debut for Nepal in September last year during Nepal’s goalless draw with Myanmar. The evening was also memorable for Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Playing his 100th international match, the 34-year-old goalkeeper produced a string of stunning saves to keep Yemen at bay till the final moments and helped Nepal earn a point.Even though Nepal failed to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and could not directly qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup, they still have a chance to secure their spot in their maiden Asian Cup through Asian Cup Qualification which will be played between March 25, 2025 to March 31, 2026.Top two teams from each nine groups qualified for the third round of 2026 FIFA World Cup and also secured a direct berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, China, Oman, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Indonesia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Australia and Palestine progressed.The 18 nations who failed to advance (India, Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Chinese Taipei, Turkmenistan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Philippines, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Nepal, Lebanon and Bangladesh) will compete in the 24-team AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers, with only six teams making it to the Asian Cup finals.Bhutan, the Maldives and Laos will join them in the third round of Asian Cup Qualification as the best ranking losing teams of the first round. The winners of the Asian Cup Qualifiers playoffs between Sri Lanka and Cambodia, Timor-Leste and Mongolia and Brunei Darussalam and Macau will also be in the competition. \nThe group stage match between Nepal and Sri Lanka of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup has been abandoned without a ball bowled due to downpour in Florida, USA on Wednesday.Earlier, rain forced the game, scheduled for 5:15am NPT, to be delayed. The game was called off after the rain continued with both sides sharing a point each.Nepal are at fourth position in the group standings, only followed by Sri Lanka who have lost two out of the three matches played. The Rhinos will need to win their remaining two matches to make it to the playoffs but their loss to familiar rivals Netherlands has been a thorn in their Super Eight hopes.Nepal made a disastrous start to their World Cup campaign on their return to cricket’s biggest stage after a decade as they lost their opening match to the Dutch team by six wickets in Dallas, Texas on June 4.Only the top two teams from each group progress to the next stage. \nNepal will aim to recover from their T20 World Cup opening loss against the Netherlands when they take on Sri Lanka in their second Group D match at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, the United States on Wednesday.But defeating the Lankans will be a difficult task for the Rhinos.Sri Lanka are under pressure after losing both of their opening group matches—against Bangladesh by two wickets and South Africa by six wickets—and the 2014 champions will also look to get back their World Cup campaign on track, starting with a victory against Nepal.The defeats have put Sri Lanka at the bottom of the group and will now need to win their remaining two matches to have a chance to reach the Super Eight.Only the top two teams from each group progress to the next stage.This will be the first meeting between Sri Lanka and Nepal in an international T20 match.The Rhinos, who are looking to progress out of the group stage for the first time in their second only World Cup appearance, sit in the fourth position in the five-team group.They will also need to win their remaining three matches to make it to the playoffs but their loss to familiar rivals Netherlands has been a thorn in their Super Eight hopes.Rohit Paudel was the only batter to look comfortable against the Dutch and will look to continue that momentum, while big hitter Dipendra Singh Airee will seek to regain his form after a poor show in the opening game.The Rhinos will also need to work on their openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh who have failed to build any impressive partnership recently. Against the Dutch, the duo were able to make just a 10-run opening stand, and both were out for single-digit scores.Nepal’s strength will probably lie in their bowling unit again. Nepal displayed a solid performance with the ball that gave the Dutch a tough time in their chase of a low 107-run target. This was a continuation of their good account with the ball from their warm-up game against Canada.They will now aim to exploit weakness in Sri Lanka’s batting that has remained very inconsistent at the World Cup.Against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka were fast to start and progressed to 100-3 after 14 overs but could only add 24 runs from their last six overs.The Lankans were all out for 77 against South Africa in their opening game.But Wanindu Hasaranga’s team will be in no mood to show mercy against Nepal. Yet their game will mostly depend on Pathum Nissanka, who made an outstanding 47 against the Tigers. \nFollowing visa denial for US games, Nepal's Sandeep Lamichhane joins T20 World Cup squad in West Indies for matches against South Africa and Bangladesh.\nA fire in a Kuwait building housing foreign workers killed 49 people, prompting an investigation into property owner violations and insufficient accommodation for the region's low-paid workforce.\nThe EU will impose tariffs on Chinese EVs (17.4%-38.1%) due to alleged subsidies, prompting China to threaten retaliation as the anti-subsidy investigation continues.\nSouth Korea's main opposition leader indicted for allegedly using underwear maker to facilitate a visit to North Korea and transfer funds.\nUnauthorized translations of popular international books, including those by Taslima Nasrin, are rampant in Nepal's book market, hurting authors and readers while damaging the country's reputation for intellectual property protection.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe seven provinces of Nepal will present the budget for FY 2024-25 on June 15 as per the mandate of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act 2017. The provinces are in a critical situation at the moment, as many of them are unstable. Over the past year and a half, the provinces have seen altogether 21 chief ministers and 23 floor tests.The frequent changes in the provincial governments have left the people disappointed with federalism, often questioning the very need of the provinces. However, they are not aware that this is happening due to the behaviour of senior party leaders and the federal government's neglect of the provinces. For instance, the federal government has yet to adjust the police for the provinces. The provision for adjusting police forces for the provinces was included in the budget speech for FY 2023-24 but nothing has been done yet. It seems unlikely to be addressed in the forthcoming fiscal year either, as it has not been included in either the policy and programme or the budget speech for FY 2024-25. Unless the chief ministers sit together at the Prime Minister's residence in Baluwatar, this issue will not be resolved easily or anytime soon.Downward budget trendThe provinces received an authorisation letter for a fiscal equalisation grant amounting to Rs58.67 billion for FY 2023-24. However, a few weeks ago, the federal government reduced this figure by 26 percent to Rs15.2 billion. This reduction has caused serious problems in the implementation of the provinces' programmes and projects. Furthermore, in the new budget for FY2024-25, the amount of fiscal transfers to the provinces has been significantly reduced. Despite this critical situation, the provinces have surprisingly failed to voice any concerns to the federal government.Regarding the total budget of the provinces, it was approximately Rs270 billion in FY 2023-24. The main sources of the provincial budget are grants (about 39 percent), followed by revenue sharing (VAT and excise duty), cash balance, and internal revenue. The share of internal revenue in the budget is 16 percent. The largest portion of the provincial budget (65 percent), comes through fiscal transfers, which include both grants and revenue sharing. The fiscal purse of the provinces is so limited that the total budget of the seven provinces from FY 2017-18 to FY 2023-24 was Rs1,586 billion, which is just Rs165 billion less than the budget of the federal government for FY 2023-24.The tax revenue rights of the provinces are minimal. Increasing the size of the provincial budget is possible only through fiscal transfers. These fiscal transfers are constitutional rights not only for the provinces but also for local levels. The fiscal transfers in the provinces' budget for FY 2024-25 is disappointing. For instance, in FY 2018-19, the first year full budget of the implementation of federalism, the budget of the Government of Nepal was Rs1,315 billion, while the grant for the provinces was Rs123 billion. This grant was 9.39 percent of the Nepal Government’s budget. The total budget size of the government for FY 2024-25 is Rs1,860 billion, an increase of Rs545 billion over this period.However, despite the significant increase in the overall budget, the grant for the provinces in FY 2024-25 is only Rs96 billion, which is Rs27 billion less than in FY 2018-19. In FY 2018-19, the provincial grant ratio was 9.39 percent of the government budget. This ratio has declined significantly to 5.18 percent in FY 2024-25. The provinces do not seem to be aware of these figures, but it is disappointing nevertheless.Federalism neglectedFurther, the policies and programmes of the ministries at the federal level have eroded the jurisdiction of the sub-federal levels. The federal government has intervened at the local level. While several sections of the budget mention coordination with the sub-federal levels, there is no actual consultation with these levels when presenting plans and programmes. How can the sub-federal levels take ownership of the plans and programmes developed without their coordination and cooperation? Article 81 of the Nepal Government’s budget states that Koshi will be developed as an industrial hub, Madhesh as an agricultural centre, Bagmati as an information technology hub, Gandaki as a tourism centre, Lumbini as a centre for small and medium industries, Karnali as a herbal hub, and Sudurpaschim as a religious tourism centre. However, there is no coordination with the provinces. These announcements have been made unilaterally without consultation with the provinces. Similarly, the budget mentions the Gandaki Economic Triangular Project concept without coordinating with the related provinces. Why has the federal government not discussed and consulted with the provinces regarding policies, programs, and potential plans? The constitution of Switzerland states that the federal government should consult with stakeholders, including the cantons (provinces), before implementing any new laws, programmes or projects. This consultation process is one of the key reasons for Switzerland's significant development across various sectors. For those affected by laws and policies, close discussions and consultations are essential to ensure full ownership and facilitate implementation, thereby promoting development. The rulers at the federal level have a centralist mindset. It should also be noted that in the Supreme Court decision related to the Giribandu Tea Estate, the court stated that sub-federal levels should be consulted when drafting any new bills related to concurrent rights. If one day, the Supreme Court decides on issues related to plans, programmes, and fiscal transfers and declares them unconstitutional, it should not be assumed otherwise.Centralist budgetConsider the budget from the perspective of ministerial allocation. According to the constitution, the responsibilities of ministries such as Finance, Defense, Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's Office are central in nature. However, the responsibilities of most other ministries are connected to the sub-federal levels. Despite this, the Ministry of Forestry has allocated only 18 percent of its total budget, and the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration only 11 percent for the provinces. The Ministry of Urban Development has allocated 8 percent, the Ministry of Health 7 percent, the Ministry of Water Supply 5 percent, the Ministry of Women 3 percent, the Ministry of Education 2 percent, and the Ministry of Labor only 1 percent of their budgets for the provinces. Several ministries, including Tourism, Industry, Home, Sports, Physical Infrastructure, Land and Cooperatives, Communications, and Law, have not allocated any funds to the provinces. The Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation has allocated only 0.7 percent of the total budget for the provinces.Most of the budget of the Ministry of Education and Labor is allocated to the local level, which is not an issue. However, it is unfortunate that the development ministries' budgets are not allocated to the provinces, as this undermines the essence of provincial governance. The constitution considers the province a key actor in development, but the budgets that should go to the provinces have been withheld by these Singadurbar-based ministries.Even an analysis of ministerial budget allocations from the first budget of federalism implementation (FY 2018-19) to FY 2024-25 reveals that except for 8 to 10 ministries, all others have reduced the jurisdiction of the sub-federal levels. I have detailed the analysis of ministries' programmes and projects for FY 2023-24 in this newspaper. I find that we do not need more than eight to 10 ministries at the federal level. When more than 60 percent of the functional responsibilities have been devolved to the sub-federal level, why do we need many ministries at the federal level? In Switzerland, there are only seven ministers at the federal level, including the President.To conclude, as the provinces prepare to present their budgets, they continue to suffer due to the federal government’s neglect of them. Fiscal transfers to the provinces have been significantly reduced, undermining federalism. Frequent changes in provincial governments, lack of support from the federal level, and insufficient coordination on policies and budgets complicate this issue. \nDelhi's urban water crisis, worsened by extreme heat, prompts intervention from the Supreme Court, releasing additional water from Himachal Pradesh, while highlighting Delhi's unsustainable water demand and the need for climate action planning and citizen conservation.\nNepal is a de facto caste-apartheid state. A 2007 Human Rights Watch report on the “untouchables” of India observed, “The only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid in South Africa.” The HRW has declared caste discrimination a form of “hidden apartheid”—an apt observation for Nepal as well.In the past years, caste hatred and exclusion have become more concealed yet pervasive in the Himalayan region; caste has also spread its tentacles in the global diaspora. Last month, Amnesty International criticised the government’s utter apathy and lack of accountability on the persistent plight of Dalits. The communist-populist alliance in government doesn’t seem to heed the call for change. This is clear from recently announced government policies, programmes and budgets for the fiscal year 2024-25. The authorities are bent on keeping caste hierarchy and untouchability sacred and solid. Budget for ‘Dalit skills’On March 21, 2022, attending a Dalit function in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that he was making a big announcement for the dignity and freedom of the “untouchables”. So much so that, he said, they would not forget it in over a century. He hasn’t made his supposedly phenomenal Dalit project explicit, but some Dalits still haven’t given up their hopes. Something came with this year’s budget for the Dalit community: Rs200 million to enhance Dalits’ traditional skills to create employment and promote their livelihood. This small yet seemingly significant budget has buoyed some Dalits. After all, as everybody says, something is better than nothing. However, I’m sceptical about the effectiveness of the Dalit-centred budget. Is it a big enough pot of money to significantly impact the target population? Most people would say “No”. Even some prominent Dalit NGO personalities close to the governing parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount. Equally, are Dalits the only beneficiaries of this new scheme? I don't think so. The details of the intended 200-million project haven’t been developed yet. But it seems many non-Dalits will also get the support, especially those close to the ruling parties and leaders. There are at least two reasons for my understanding. First is the very name of the entity the government plans to establish to use that money: A separate body called the “Dalit, Neglected and Oppressed Class Upliftment and Development Corporation.” The use of so many words is likely intended to involve the beneficiaries from different castes and social groups. My suspicion stems from the second fact: In today’s Nepal, traditional Dalit skills—such as goldsmithing, tailoring, woodworking, and shoemaking—are no longer exclusively practised by Dalits. Once commercialised, many castes including the apex groups, have started these trades. So, skill enhancement projects will probably not be offered only to Dalits. I am not suggesting Dalits should have exclusive rights over these essential skills. It is neither practical nor proper to make such a case. My point is that it is probably wrong to think that the budget is for the betterment of Dalits. Untouched untouchabilityI have a serious objection to the utter lack of sensitivity towards the problems of Dalits, mainly the persistent practice of untouchability (hidden apartheid) in government policies, programmes and the budget. There is no single statement in the policies that mentions untouchability, let alone try to address it. The same applies to the state and local authorities under the federal system. The biggest irony is found in the Karnali Province, where the Province Head, Tilak Pariyar, is a Dalit man with a long history of fighting against the state as part of the Maoist movement, with ending caste oppression as a primary goal. On May 23, he presented 84-point policies and programmes of the province. Study it in detail, and aside from lip service here and there, there is no serious concern about the situation of Dalits in Karnali who have been facing caste humiliation and violence like nowhere else in the country. Yet the authorities seem totally blind to the realities! Recommended policy objectives What should a responsible government do, both in Kathmandu and Karnali? First, the federal capital should become sensitive towards the plight of Dalits, who suffer tremendously due to popular beliefs and practices of ritual impurity. Then, the federal capital should design a national policy framework that could be followed by the lower authorities.On a Sunday press meet, Caste Watch Network (CWN), a newly launched Dalit campaign group, recommended two fundamental policy objectives for tackling the complex problem of untouchability.First, the state should introduce new laws and policies—sticks and carrots—to enforce the constitutional and legal provisions against untouchability. It could, for example, forge a policy of immediately suspending government officials guilty of excluding and humiliating Dalits. Elderly people who discriminate against Dalits could be deprived of their elderly pensions for two years or so. Any temple practising Dalit exclusion could be deprived of state support in the form of money and sacred offerings and sacrificial animals (yes, even the historical and famous temples like Gorakhkali and Manakamana do practise a form of social exclusion). The second important policy objective would be to reform the religion. Some people frown at my suggestions about initiating religious and cultural reform, which they think takes many decades, if not centuries.While we cannot easily rewrite casteist texts like Manusmriti and Parasaramriti, it is possible to achieve the reformation of some religious beliefs and practices over time. For that, the secular state should stand firm against religious dogma and formulate proper laws and implement them. If no religious and/or cultural reform were possible at all, we would still be burning our mothers and sisters and other women alive on the sati pyres. If reform weren’t possible, we wouldn’t see a section of Bahuns drinking alcohol and consuming pork, and, as alluded to earlier, engaging in tailoring, drumming, shoemaking and goldsmithing. Upper castes have deceived Dalits. They have forced religious and cultural transformations in areas that benefit them materially and in other ways. And they have been opposed to the reform of those areas of religious and cultural traditions that would ensure equal rights for Dalits. For example, a Bahun doesn’t become polluted by drinking and drumming; these transgressions do not anger his deities. But he thinks he and his family, lineage and other deities and spirits become polluted if a drummer enters his house. Religious-cultural reform is not as tough as it seems. Governments and authorities at all levels should introduce new laws and policies and spend large sums to change the spiritual, religious and cultural spheres. Without this, we cannot do away with untouchability. \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal inaugurated its second general convention on Monday. The Upendra Yadav-led party is holding the mega event at a time the party has suffered multiple setbacks. Seven of its 12 federal lawmakers split the JSP-Nepal and registered a new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—at the Election Commission last month. The party of Upendra Yadav, who headed the party that had continuously led Madhesh provincial government since 2018, has been pushed to the opposition bench in the provincial assembly. Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and health minister in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet until last month, has been ousted from the federal government as well. Despite such adverse circumstances, Yadav is poised to be the party chief again, most likely unopposed.Yadav rose to power after successfully spearheading a Madhesh movement in 2007 demanding rights for the historically marginalised Madheshi people. Though the demand for federalism had been raised by various quarters even in the past, it was Yadav-led agitation that eventually forced the Nepali state to introduce the federal system in the country. He formed Madheshi Janadhikar Forum-Nepal under his own leadership. Since then he has always been at the helm of a party. He has merged his party with various outfits, multiple times, only to split again.With the rise of Madheshi parties in the aftermath of the second people’s movement in 2006, people—not only from the southern belt of the country but also from most marginalised communities—had high hopes for a paradigm shift in Nepali politics. The big parties traditionally holding power, namely the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, had felt pressure. But within years of their joining governments in Kathmandu, people were disenchanted by their performance. A section of people expected that the regional parties would do better when allowed to lead provincial governments. They failed in the province as well.In Nepal, communist leaders and parties have been infamous for persistent disputes and divisions, mostly after the 1990 political change. When parties mushroomed in Madhesh, they beat the communists in terms of infightings and divisions. There is not a single party in Madhesh that remained intact, which is disappointing for those who expected that regional forces would build pressure on traditional forces through better delivery.Mismanagement, lack of organisational discipline, non-transparency and top leaders’ monopoly in decision-making have become common traits of Madhesh-based parties. Big parties such as the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre are criticised for being monopolistic and rather undemocratic. But, newer forces proved themselves worse. For instance, at least the big parties have been holding their general conventions as per the constitutional provision. Their provincial, district and village units are also elected through a process. For example, the UML is now electing its district leaders through conventions. When they fail to pick leaders in consensus, they readily go for a vote. Top leaders may favour those loyal to them but even these loyalists must nonetheless follow the process. That is why the UML is considered the most organised party in the country. The Congress also follows at least basic democratic norms while electing its leaders and making important decisions. But we don’t see the same in Madhesh-based and other newly emerged forces. This is unfortunate. Only political parties that are well-organised, democratic and transparent in their activities will have the moral strength to mount pressure on big forces. Those who can’t maintain democracy and transparency in their own organisations can’t ensure it in the government when they come to power. We hardly find any leader in Madhesh handing over party leadership to other leaders through a democratic process. We hope that in the ongoing convention Yadav’s JSP-Nepal can bring policies to make the party organisation more transparent and democratic. \nAmbassadors aren’t magicians. No matter how good their PR skills are, it takes time and effort to cultivate good working relations with the officials of their host countries. When a country constantly chops and changes its ambassadors, diplomacy becomes difficult. Nepali political parties have a wretched record of abruptly recalling ambassadors appointed by the previous coalition governments. But Thursday's silly recall of Dr Shankar Sharma, Nepali ambassador to India, must be the most egregious of them all. The Cabinet decided to recall Sharma days ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s New Delhi visit to attend the third swearing-in of Narendra Modi as India’s prime minister. Why couldn’t Dahal have waited until he got back from New Delhi? With what authority would an ambassador that his prime minister clearly does not trust coordinate his India trip? Why the rush, one wonders. Of course, it is natural for a new government to want to appoint those it can rely on as the country’s envoys. But then our envoys are Nepal’s representatives abroad, whose conduct can make or break the country’s image. This is why only the most capable of them should make the cut. And if the best of the best are chosen, they should be allowed to work for the four full years. This time, the government has recalled not just its Indian ambassador but also its envoys from 10 other countries, including the US and the UK. Notably, these envoys were appointed by the same prime minister before he changed his main coalition partner, from the Nepali Congress to the CPN-UML. This is unfortunate. Political instability has had a devastating impact on Nepali economy as it now struggles to achieve even a modest 4 percent annual growth. It has destroyed our domestic institutions. The same instability is now also affecting our standing abroad. If Nepal’s major political actors cannot send a message of unity and purpose to the rest of the world, how will others trust us? Why would they come and invest in Nepal?Our relations with major powers like India and the US are not things to be trifled with, at a time of heightened geopolitical competition in the region. In these contested times, the only way Nepal can safely navigate the choppy geopolitical waters is through mature diplomacy. Appoint the right people in the right capitals and give them a free hand. What is particularly strange about the most recent recall of 11 ambassadors is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to have been bypassed, as the decision was apparently made against the advice of Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha. This is not the first time that the advice of the foreign ministry has been sidelined. The diplomatic code of conduct is widely ignored and the ministry continues to be kept out of the loop as our top leaders engage with their foreign counterparts. Again, even if the ambassadors are to be appointed on political quotas (which they ideally should not), there can be a political understanding to pick the best of the lot and to let them serve out their term. Unless that happens, political instability at home will continue to harm Nepal's foreign conduct, with grave consequences for the Nepali national interest.  \nSatish Singh of the Janamat Party is set to become Madhesh Province's new chief minister after Saroj Kumar Yadav lost a vote of confidence, marking the 21st government change in Nepal's provinces since 2022 elections, reflecting instability due to coalition politics and disregarding people's concerns.\nThe federal system in Nepal, adopted in 2015, has faced challenges due to parties' reluctance to accept its spirit, resulting in centralized decision-making and a lack of provincial autonomy.\nThe Nepali Congress negotiated with the ruling parties to define the jurisdiction of a parliamentary committee tasked with investigating the cooperative scam and secured the inclusion of Gorkha Media Network in the probe, though Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane's name was not explicitly mentioned.\nDespite growing human rights backsliding and shrinking civic space globally, particularly in South Asia, Nepal faces challenges in its transitional justice process, including categorizing crimes as serious and non-serious, leading to potential impunity for perpetrators.\nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) is preparing for its first general convention, seeking to address policy and leadership issues after a record of poor performance since its 2021 formation.\nAs the UN Resident Coordinator, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy discusses Nepal's progress towards SDGs, LDC graduation challenges, peace consolidation, and the UN's role amidst geopolitical polarization.\nPartly cloudy skies with slight rain in some areas, while Kathmandu anticipates a high of 31°C and partly sunny conditions; Nepalgunj remains the warmest at 43.6°C, with Jomsom experiencing the coldest at 14°C.\nPartly cloudy to fair weather is expected nationwide, with some regions experiencing light rain and thunderstorms, and Kathmandu reaching a maximum temperature of 31 degrees Celsius.\nCracks in 200+ locations found in Nepal after earthquake, posing flood and landslide risks during upcoming monsoon, despite vulnerable populations remaining in unfit areas and the government lacking relocation plans.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.
