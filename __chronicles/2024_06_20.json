Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe process of enacting a separate air carriers’ liability and insurance legislation for domestic carriers has stalled yet again.On March 1, the Cabinet approved the tourism ministry’s proposal to prepare a draft bill on domestic air carriers’ liability and insurance.This was done years after Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999, which makes international airlines liable in case of death or injury to passengers. Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepal’s 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepal’s domestic airlines—nine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicopters—flew 4.15 million passengers in 2023. \nThe southwest monsoon entered Nepal on June 10, three days earlier than usual. However, despite this early arrival, the monsoon has not advanced beyond a few districts of the Koshi Province even after nine days.“Generally, it takes two days for the monsoon to reach the Kathmandu Valley after entering eastern Nepal,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecasting Division. “This year, we have not yet issued a second release about the monsoon progress.”Met officials and locals from Western Nepal, especially those in the Tarai districts, hoped for relief from the scorching heat. They expected that monsoon rains would arrive within days after entering the eastern part of the country. However, the monsoon clouds did not advance from the Koshi Province until Wednesday evening, leaving people struggling with the scorching heat. Maximum temperatures in several districts of western Nepal have remained over 40 degrees Celsius for the last several weeks, making daily life difficult, especially for the poor people who have to work outdoors during daytime to make ends meet.Badly affected by the heatwave, several schools in the districts have extended their leave. On Wednesday, Dhangadhi recorded 42.3 degree Celsius, followed by Nepalgunj 41.5, Birendranagar 40.1, Dipayal 40.2 degree Celsius. Kathmandu recorded 30.6 degree Celsius, according to the met office.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year southwest monsoon entered Nepal on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than the normal onset day. A normal monsoon, supported by the timely arrival of rain, translates into favourable agricultural production, mainly of paddy, and is further linked with the country’s overall economic growth.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts for 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.According to Manandhar, the easterly wind that brought monsoon rainfall in eastern Nepal is not strong enough to displace the westerly winds. Some places in Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces have been witnessing rainfall for the last couple of days, but this is caused by the local system, western disturbances, and low-pressure areas developed in Bihar, India.“We will issue the next bulletin in a couple of days to inform the public about the monsoon’s progress,” said Manandhar. “As the weather is unpredictable, so is the monsoon rainfall.”Met officials said that the early onset of the monsoon rain doesn't ensure early progress across the country.Last year it took three weeks for the monsoon to spread all over the country. “Sometimes, it spreads within two days,” said Manandhar.The Met Office has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events, such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.The department’s climate section has issued a weather forecast for four months, from June to September. It said most parts of the country are likely to experience above-average minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall due to weakened El Nino conditions and the development of La Nina conditions.El Nino refers to climatic patterns where ocean surface temperatures warm unusually. La Nina is the opposite where the ocean surface cools off.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by the monsoon this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly impacted, and 18,000 families will require rescue due to monsoon-related disasters. \nNepal and China held a meeting of the Joint Expert Group in Beijing on Wednesday.Prakash Joshi, the director general of the Department of Survey, led the Nepali delegation. Although the meeting concluded on Wednesday, both sides have yet to share the details.A Nepali participant from Beijing said although the meeting concluded on Wednesday, some formalities will be completed on Thursday. “We will only be able to share more details on Thursday,” he said.The meeting took place after almost 18 years of hiatus, just ahead of the Nepal-China foreign secretary-level talks slated for June 25. Representatives from ministries including foreign affairs, home affairs, defence, land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation, as well as the Nepali Embassy in Beijing participated in the meeting.The last meeting of the Joint Expert Group was held in 2006 in Kathmandu. The mechanism mandates a joint inspection of the Nepal-China border, dispute resolution, and finalisation of the fourth protocol to be signed by the two sides. The third Nepal-China boundary protocol was signed in 1988.The official said concerns from both sides were discussed in the meeting, and a positive outcome is expected. In the meeting, both sides discussed the status of the Nepal-China boundary, the date for commencing a joint boundary inspection, disputes in the Nepal-China border, and the signing of the Border Management System, whose initial agreement was signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit in 2019.The Chinese side has sent a copy of the border management agreement, which is now under the review of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, according to a joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.According to a senior official familiar with the matter, although the text of the Boundary Management System is yet to be released, it envisions forming two panels—a joint commission on boundary matters between Nepal and China, and a committee of boundary representatives to be led by competent authorities from the two countries.Nepal is yet to ratify the boundary management system.The joint secretary said the meeting will also discuss outstanding issues, such as the timing and form of inspection, and whether it should start anew or resume from where it was left in 2006.Nepal and China concluded their first boundary talks in 1961 and signed the Boundary Protocol in 1963.The 1963 Joint Boundary Protocol provides for three different mechanisms to deal with boundary issues: the Joint Inspection Team, Joint Expert Group, and Joint Inspection Committee. The mechanisms were enshrined in the Nepal-China Boundary Protocol signed between the two countries on January 20, 1963. Later, Nepal and China renewed the Boundary Protocol in 1979 and 1988.While the Joint Expert Group is led by the director general of the Department of Survey from the Nepali side and their Chinese counterpart, the Joint Inspection Committee is led by the deputy director general or under secretary from the Department of Survey and their Chinese counterpart, as per the practice and provisions. Similarly, the joint inspection committee is led by the joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.As per the boundary protocol, Nepal and China should conduct a joint boundary inspection every ten years.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on July 15, 2022, that officials from Nepal and China held a virtual talk in which they decided to activate the existing boundary mechanisms through mutual consultation.According to officials and experts, Nepal and China have a dispute over pillar number 57 in Dolakha district, which was a major bone of contention following the resolution of the height of Mt Everest in December 2020. Besides pillar no 57, disputes have often surfaced in Humla, Gorkha, and Kimathanka (Sankhuwasabha), which need to be resolved through joint inspection. In addition to resolving disputes, as per the boundary protocol, both sides should update the boundary status every 10 years.Despite the Nepal government’s claims that the Nepal-China border is largely free from disputes, there are reports of several boundary-related issues, such as encroachment, fencing and wiring, illegal construction, missing border pillars, lack of maintenance of boundary markers, and the Chinese side's use of high-level digital surveillance on the border. Nepali security agencies deployed on the border reported these issues to the Ministry of Home Affairs. \nAt least two police personnel have been found dead during duty hours within a week. The back-to-back apparent suicides in the Nepal Police organisation have raised concerns about mental health and the need for psychological training to ensure that officers are mentally as well as physically fit.A police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu, on Wednesday morning. Ajit Gole, 22, of Dolakha was found dead in a toilet of the parliament compound. After a preliminary investigation, police suspected that he shot himself.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6 am to 10 am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. According to a police source, Gole was engaged to a girl five months ago. The girl went to Dubai with Gole's monetary and other support. However, after reaching Dubai, she reportedly stopped contacting him. “Our primary finding is that Gole’s death is related to family issues,” Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police, told the Post.However, Karki refused to blame Gole’s death solely on his relationship with the girl. “It would be too early to reach a conclusion.” Lawmaker Menaka Kumari Pokharel of the ruling CPN-UML raised the issue of mental well-being in the police force at a meeting of the House of Representatives hours after the incident. She emphasised the need for psychological counselling in addition to other training for the security personnel. Speaking in the zero hours of the House meeting, lawmaker Pokharel said that as the army and police personnel are becoming the victims of mental stress, psychological counselling should be made a part of the official training. “Today, another incident occurred on these premises,” lawmaker Pokharel said. Though the issue of mental state of duty personnel has drawn public concern, a senior official at the police hospital said no serious problems are observed among Nepal Police personnel.“We barely see any member visiting the hospital seeking treatment for mental issues,” the senior police official told the Post, requesting anonymity. “Our society holds social taboos about mental health, and these are also reflected in police officers.” On June 13, another policewoman, Karishma Sunuwar, 25, was found dead by hanging in the bathroom of the Women, Children and Elderly Citizens Service Centre of the district police office, Siraha. Meanwhile, police on Tuesday arrested 27-year-old Pushkar Thapa Magar, a police constable from Banke working in Humla, on the charge of suicide abetment in the case of Karishma Sunwar. In Sunuwar and Gole's cases, a common factor was relationship. When both police officers could not handle the psychological pressure from their troubled relationships, they seem to have decided to take their own life, says a former police officer, asking not to be named.Both are psychological issues, which need to be addressed in time, the former police officer told the Post.Police spokesperson Karki said the increasing number of suicides among police personnel may be rooted in their psychological problems, among other factors.But there is no gauge to measure someone’s psychological problem. The only way to know if someone is a victim of psychological distress is through communication by family members or friends about their problems. “But in the cases of two police officers who committed suicide, we were not aware of their psychological issues,” Karki added.Karki said they also ease police officers' duties if they know their problems. “For example, we do not make them work long hours, nor do we assign them duties involving weapons.” \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Thursday defended the government’s recent decision to recall Nepal’s ambassadors from several countries.Speaking at the meeting of the House of Representatives, Dahal said that the envoys were recalled as per the constitution adding that the government was making efforts to adopt the policy to evaluate ambassadors as per objective, in order to strengthen the country’s diplomatic relations.“The government is committed to mobilising diplomatic missions and envoys in the best interest of the nation,” he said. “As per the Ambassador Appointment Directive, 2015, the envoys can be recalled before the completion of their terms if deemed necessary.”Only those who have been appointed as ambassadors under political quota are recalled immediately after the change in the coalition, the prime minister added, “instead this time around, the envoys remained in their posts for more than three months after the change in the ruling coalition.” Dahal said that this was proof of how the government was serious about the issue.Government picks some ambassadors under political quota based on recommendations from coalition partners while it selects some career diplomats from within the ministry of foreign affairs for other countries.Talking about his recent India visit, Prime Minister Dahal also said that discussion regarding the effective implementation of the agreements reached between the two South Asian neighbours was held.During a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, strengthening Nepal-India relations, implementation of past agreements, and bilateral discussions—including border disputes, among other matters were discussed, according to him.“Serious discussion about the implementation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, Arun Hydropower Project and cooperation in the agricultural sector was held,” Dahal said.Dahal visited New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi on June 9. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel’s recent visit to Switzerland and Germany emphasised the need for the international community to focus on the priorities of underdeveloped mountainous countries like Nepal regarding climate change, the Office of the President said.Kiran Pokharel, press advisor to the President, said that a number of events during Paudel’s visit drew international attention to the impacts of climate change in countries like Nepal—particularly the President’s address at the inaugural forum of the Global Coalition for Social Justice of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, his meetings with German scientists, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier’s concern about climate change during their bilateral discussion.During his visit to various climate research centres in Germany, Paudel had praised the Germans’ research on the issue and suggested that they focus on measures to minimise the effects of climate change, Pokharel added.The President, who had embarked on a weeklong visit to Switzerland and Germany on June 11, returned home on June 19. During his stay, President Paudel held meetings with his Swiss and German counterparts on June 13 and 17, respectively, and discussed issues of bilateral interest.Paudel had also requested the researchers to make the international community aware of what needed to be done to minimise emissions from carbon-emitting countries.“Your research relating to climate change so far has been praiseworthy,” Pokharel quoted the President as saying. “But I believe your research should now focus on how to protect ourselves from the varied effects of climate change. Similarly, you must also suggest to the international community what needs to be done by the carbon-emitting nations to minimise emissions and also by smaller nations affected by it.”German President Steinmeier had expressed his gratitude for Paudel’s suggestions to the scientists during their bilateral meeting and had extended the European nation’s sympathy for a mountainous country like Nepal.Steinmeier also added that Germany was ready to provide Nepal with whatever aid it required.President Paudel had expressed his hopes for Germany’s investment in agriculture, water resource management, and tourism development of Nepal.He also requested Germany to facilitate the release and repatriation of six Nepalis who have been kept in Ukrainian military custody. Germany, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), has been providing military assistance to Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine war.In his speech at the inaugural forum of the Global Coalition for Social Justice of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, President Paudel stressed the need to shift the international community’s focus to climate change.“While discussing social justice, we should not forget climate justice, which should be established as a global issue,” Paudel said. “The international community, especially large carbon emitters, should not deviate from their responsibility.”Climate justice must be immediately ensured to the carbon-negative countries that are vulnerable to the varied effects of climate change by providing adequate funding and necessary technological assistance, Paudel added.Paudel said that Nepal has had to face the brunt of climate change even if it has only a negligible contribution to the warming climate. Mountains, including Mount Everest, have been turning into blocks of rocks due to rising temperatures and the depletion of glaciers at an unprecedented rate, Paudel said.“Climate change has seriously affected clean water, crops, biodiversity and health, pushing millions of our people into extreme poverty and inequality,” he said. “The displacement of families, communities and loss of livelihood due to climate change disasters has made the problem even more complex.” \nAvant-garde, mysterious, and maximalist, Gopal Kalapremi Shrestha’s residential studio in Baluwatar has a personality of its own. Dimly lit, the stairway is adorned with esoteric, vivid and diverse artwork collected over the years. Gas cylinders line up on the floor like ants, powering the kiln for his ceramics.The walls of his studio are filled with stacks of paint boxes, and the floor is scattered with eccentric statues whose forms range from the whimsically abstract to the hauntingly realistic. In-progress artworks are stacked on shelves, and tools hang on the walls and cover the floor, blurring the line between utilitarian and aesthetic. In the living room, a cabinet contains artworks by his family members, including Shrestha’s wife and youngest son, who is teaching fine art abroad. Passing another flight of stairs, he shows me a rare ceramic method from China and miniatures made by his wife. The top floor houses a kitchen, with a dining table adorned with huge vases featuring painted anthropomorphic figures—part of his ongoing collection, ‘Eclipse’. A shelf displays brightly glazed cups of various colours, and adjacent to this is a door to the terrace, where the family dog greets me with jovial barks. The terrace maintains the same eccentric personality as the rest of the house—with pots and statues of varying sizes, shapes, and stories. Here, Shrestha shares his profound connection with crows and explains his fascination with the bird, whose imagery he frequently incorporates into his artwork.  Perhaps, touring his house before sitting down for a formal interview was an offering of an alternate kind of understanding—a prelude before I began to bore him with the quintessential questions of reportage.You can tell a lot about a person by the objects they collect—or the ones they don’t. In Shrestha’s sanctuary of artistic clutter, you begin to understand him through the stories woven into each object. He shares these tales in a delightfully non-linear fashion, expecting you to piece them together on your own.Shrestha is an artist who works in many mediums, though he is primarily known for his ceramics and sculptures. He also paints and writes poetry. According to him, the greatest pleasure in his career comes from mentoring young artists and imparting the knowledge he has gained.He takes inspiration from all kinds of conflicts to incorporate into his artwork, both intrinsic and extrinsic. He has created pieces inspired by the Maoist insurgency and the COVID pandemic. He is also deeply fascinated by the female form, which he incorporates into his works.In one of his art series, he features three sculptures of female goddesses linked to the well-known Sanskrit chant “Ya devi sarvabhuteshu,” which dictates that a woman can be both creator and destroyer. Shrestha says that he has great respect for mothers and derives great inspiration from them.Autodidactic, with a penchant for learning the abstract, Shrestha is deeply curious and possesses remarkable inquisitiveness. He is mostly self-taught, “My curiosity made me an artist. As an eager individual, I would board a random bus from Ratnapark with no destination in mind. Wherever I would end up, I would paint the landscape,” he says.Perhaps this curiosity led him to foreign lands, where he began to understand different types of art forms. Initially fascinated by terracotta statues, he learned the chemistry behind the glazing technique from a French artist during a residency in India—a method he then incorporated into his own work.Additionally, he collects a diverse range of artworks during his extensive travels, turning his home into a museum of sorts.\"I have a deep disdain for people who fetishise the suffering of artists; artists can make good art without suffering,\" says Shrestha, while also acknowledging that much of his work is driven by deep emotional turmoil. His recent ongoing work, ‘The Eclipse’, represents a time of distress due to various circumstances.“An artist harbours deep curiosity, someone who pays close attention to all that is around him,” says Shrestha as he recounts his childhood. Even though he grew up in poverty, he fondly looks back at his early years. At this point in life, he finds himself deeply nostalgic for his childhood days, so much so that he is planning to write a book on nostalgia. “I want this book to be a remembrance of the time I am from,” he says. Shrestha is a prodigal talker. He is informed, ardent, informal, and relaxed. He habitually quotes individuals such as Gautam Buddha, Vincent Van Gogh’s sister-in-law, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Chinese artist Ai Weiwei—drawing from a reservoir of arcane wisdom and recondite insights.His recollections are vivid, descriptive, yet fragmented and emotional. He has a deep gratitude for his friends who helped him make the ceramics field more popular in Nepal. He recounts meeting Ian Martin, whom he befriended on a single day in 2006 when he was visiting Nepal for peace talks amid the Maoist insurgency.When he befriended Martin, he was unaware that Martin was a UN official and conversed with him too casually—with multiple pats on the back as well. The following day, he saw Martin in the newspaper and was befuddled and a little embarrassed to have treated a dignitary so informally.He called Martin again, and they stayed in touch in the years that followed. Shrestha says that Martin also brought him boxes filled with books on ceramics as a present, something he is deeply grateful for.Deep into the conversation, he breaks the interview’s fourth wall with piercing honesty, “When you interview me, your worldview and biases are inevitably reflected. In writing about me, you inevitably write about yourself,” he asserts, something with which I vehemently agree.“The world, nature, and our energies are deeply connected,” muses Shrestha, who identifies as deeply spiritual rather than religious. He feels it is essential to distinguish between the two. “I believe in energies,” he says.His art exhibitions, like ‘Heroes’, featured 108 sculptures. In ‘Where the Wild Things Are’, Shrestha uses ceramic art to explore the impact of the pandemic and value the power of women.In his series of artistic chess pieces called ‘Tharu’, inspired by tribal motifs, he is influenced and inspired by the socio-cultural changes in Nepal.His extensive body of work spans various genres and periods, for which Shrestha has received numerous accolades, including awards from the Royal Nepal Academy (1983), the National Art Competition for Contemporary Sculpture by NAFA (1985, 1986), the National Art Competition for Contemporary Ceramic Sculpture by NAFA (1996), and the Creative Artist Man of the Year award presented by the Nepal Art Society (2005), among others.But in his quiet house, brimming with students he mentors on sculpture and ceramics, Shrestha finds himself detached from it all. Amid the comforting familiarity of his surroundings, he self-reflects, internalises, and eventually attempts to understand himself and the world around him.Amidst sentimental objects and books fervently memorised, Gopal is simply kalapremi, a faithful lover of arts. \nPrime Minister Dahal announces refund of Rs772.44 million to victims of cooperative scams, initiates efforts to establish a dedicated regulatory body, and acknowledges the contributions of law-abiding cooperatives.\nNepal's cricket team made its mark at the T20 World Cup, despite not winning any matches, and raised hopes for future success with strong performances against top teams.\nSri Lanka's upcoming presidential election renews debates on the implementation of the 13th Amendment, a measure aimed at resolving Tamil insurgency through devolution of power to Provincial Councils, with the UNP, TNA, and President Wickremesinghe supporting its full implementation, while the Rajapakses and ultra-nationalists remain opposed.\nIn 2023, the EU saw a 20% increase in first-time asylum applications (1,048,900), primarily from Syria, Afghanistan, Turkey, Venezuela, and Colombia, amid ongoing concerns about the adequacy of the EU's Migration and Asylum Pact and its potential impact on protection seekers.\nNepal faces challenges in promoting electric vehicles due to a lack of clear policies, a tax hike, and insufficient charging infrastructure, despite its commitment to EV-based mobility by 2030.\nA man drowned in a flooded river, and floods displaced three families in Jhapa district, Nepal.\nIsraeli tanks backed by warplanes and drones advanced deeper into the western part of the Gaza Strip city of Rafah on Wednesday, killing eight people, according to residents and Palestinian medics.Residents said the tanks moved into five neighbourhoods after midnight. Heavy shelling and gunfire hit the tents of displaced families in the Al-Mawasi area, further to the west of the coastal enclave, they said.Some eight months into the war, there has been no sign of let up in the fighting as efforts by international mediators, backed by the United States, have failed to persuade Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire.Twelve Palestinians were also killed in an Israeli strike that hit a group of citizens and merchants in the south of the Gaza Strip, medical sources told Reuters on Wednesday.The people were hit as they waited for convoys of aid trucks carrying goods through the Kerem Shalom crossing in Salahuddin Road northeast of Rafah, the sources added.Israeli forces have laid waste to much of Gaza and seized most of the Palestinian territory but have yet to achieve Israel’s stated goal of wiping out Hamas and freeing Israeli hostages.Medics and Hamas media said eight Palestinians were killed in Al-Mawasi and many families fled north in panic. They did not identify the fatalities, and the Israeli military said it was looking into the report.Residents said Israeli army forces blew up several homes in western Rafah, which had sheltered over half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people before last month, when Israel began its ground offensive and forced most of the population to head northwards.Some United Nations and Palestinian figures put those who remained at under 100,000 people.“Another night of horror in Rafah. They opened fire from planes, drones and tanks on the western areas to cover for their invasion,” said one Rafah resident, who asked not to be named.“Bullets and shells landed in the Mawasi area near where people slept, killing and wounding many,” he told Reuters via a chat app.An Israeli commander briefing military correspondents in Rafah on Tuesday named two more locations there - Shaboura and Tel Al-Sultan - where the army planned to take on Hamas fighters.“The Hamas battalions there are not yet well worn down and we need to dismantle them completely. We estimate it at more or less a month, at this intensity,” Colonel Liron Batito, head of the Givati Brigade, told Army Radio.The Israeli military remained in control of the border between Rafah and Egypt. Footage circulated on social media showed the Rafah crossing, the only window for most of Gaza’s population with the outside world, was destroyed, buildings burnt, and Israeli tanks positioned there with the flag of Israel flying over some places.The Israeli military said aid into Gaza had not been impeded by the damage.Further north, Israel sent a column of tanks back into the Zeitoun neighbourhood in Gaza City, and residents reported heavy fire from tanks and warplanes but also sounds of gun battles with Hamas-led fighters.In another Gaza City suburb, Sheikh Radwan, an Israeli air strike on a house killed four Palestinians, including a child, medics said. A total of 20 people were killed across Gaza.The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said fighters battled Israeli forces with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs, and have in some areas detonated pre-planted explosive devices against army units.Later on Wednesday, Palestinian gunmen fired rockets at the Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Gaza, the Israeli military said.Israel’s ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left much of the population homeless and destitute.Since a week-long truce in November, repeated attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refuses to end the war before Hamas is eradicated and the hostages are freed.On Wednesday, the United Nations human rights office said Israeli forces may have repeatedly violated fundamental principles of the laws of war and failed to distinguish between civilians and fighters in their Gaza campaign.In a report assessing six Israeli attacks that caused a high number of casualties and destruction of civilian infrastructure, the UN Human Rights Office said Israeli forces “may have systematically violated the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions in attack”.Israel’s permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva called the analysis “factually, legally, and methodologically flawed”. \nThe weather today will be generally cloudy in Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province, and Gandaki Province. The rest of the country will experience partly cloudy to mainly fair conditions.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, there are chances of light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning in some places in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces. A few areas in Madhesh and Sudurpaschim provinces, along with one or two places in the rest of the country, may also experience similar weather. Heavy rain is likely to occur in one or two locations in Koshi Province, as stated in the weather bulletin for Thursday.Tonight, the skies will remain partly to generally cloudy in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, while the rest of the country will have partly cloudy conditions. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is expected in some places in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces. A few areas in Madhesh and one or two places in the rest of the country may also see similar weather. Heavy rainfall is likely to occur in one or two places in Koshi Province.Stay updated with the latest weather reports and take necessary precautions, especially in areas prone to heavy rainfall.On Wednesday, Dhangadi recorded a scorching maximum temperature of 42.3 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature in Jomsom was a cool 16 degrees Celsius. \nDiarrhoeal cases have declined threefold in Nepal, multiple reports, including a recent one by the Nepal Statistics Office, show. The Nepal Demographic Health Survey-2022 and a report of the Ministry of Health and Population suggest the same.Improvements in water and sanitation conditions, personal hygiene and awareness levels are credited with the decline in infection from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoeal infections.“A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices,” reads a report by the Nepal Statistics Office.Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health concern usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. It is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, also showed that 10 percent of children under 5 have diarrhoea. The prevalence of diarrhoea is highest among children aged 6-11 months at 18 percent, followed by 13 percent each among those aged 12–23 months and less than six months.Public health experts say the decline in open defecation, the general public’s behavioural change towards hygienic practice, and an increase in literacy and education levels could have also contributed to a decline in diarrhoeal infections.“Decline in open defecation, rise in education and awareness levels, behavioural changes, improvement in water and sanitation conditions play an important role in cutting the burden of diarrhoeal infections,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “We can see a lot of changes in these things, but at the same time, we should not forget that sources of drinking water are still problematic in many places, including in the capital city.”According to the NDHS report, advice or treatment was sought for 57 percent of children who had diarrhoea in the two weeks preceding the survey, down from 64 percent in 2016.The report also shows that the percentage of diarrhoeal infection is lower among those with an unimproved source of drinking water at 4 percent than among those with an improved source at 11 percent.Experts say that so-called improved sources of drinking water are still not safe to drink.“E.coli and coliform-like hazardous microbes get detected in most water resources, including in the samples of bottled water,” Pun said. “We must be more cautious while drinking water, as the monsoon season has just started and most water sources get contaminated with floodwaters.”Earlier in March, drinking water samples collected from public taps and community schools in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur were found to be contaminated with faecal coliform.Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. Its presence means that the drinking water being used by locals of Godawari is contaminated with sewage.The Ministry of Health and Population’s annual report for the fiscal year 2022-23 also shows a three-fold decline in diarrhoeal infections. According to the report, the national incidence rate of diarrhoea was 115 per 1,000 under-five children in 2022-23 compared to 365 in the fiscal year 2021-22.The ministry’s report showed four under-five deaths from diarrhoeal infection in the fiscal year 2022-23 compared to 34 deaths in 2021-22.Of the four deaths that occurred in the fiscal year 2022-23, one each was recorded in Bagmati, Madhesh, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with no reported diarrhoeal death in Lumbini, Koshi, and Gandaki provinces.Contrary to the NDHS, the health ministry’s report shows that Karnali Province had the highest incidence of diarrhoea—216, followed by Lumbini Province’s 161. The lowest incidence was reported in Bagmati Province at 78.According to the World Health Organisation, diarrhoea is the second leading cause of mortality in children under five. The disease has also been linked with growth and cognitive shortfalls in children, especially in marginalised communities.Doctors say the only ways to prevent people from dying of water-borne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the country’s transitional justice process paralysed, a Nepali conflict victim has taken to the United Nations forum to remind the Nepal government of its responsibilities towards the victims.Speaking before the UN Security Council in New York on Wednesday, Ram Kumar Bhandari, whose father was forcibly disappeared by the state security forces in 2001, said that the state has the responsibility to search for answers and provide closure to the victims, but it has not done enough. Nepal endured a violent Maoist insurgency from 1996, which ended after ten years with a comprehensive peace accord in 2006.Bhandari addressed the council as a representative of the Global Alliance of the Missing, advocating for families of missing and disappeared people across the world.“The world has not done enough to acknowledge the suffering of the families or to address their needs,” he said. “Families in Nepal are still waiting for answers 18 years after the end of the conflict.” This is the second time that an insurgency victim was allowed to speak before the UN Security Council, considered one of the most influential UN bodies. He said the families would like to remind states that they seek their continued support in mobilising the relevant authorities to find the “political will” and the needed resources so that families can find truth, answers, and justice. There is no sustainable peace without individual peace, he asserted. “We, families of missing people, would like to encourage states to adopt missing persons legislation and appropriate legal frameworks in all countries where missing persons are present,” he further said. Talking to the Post over the phone from New York, he said that addressing the UN Security Council was a great opportunity to remind the leadership from different countries, including Nepal, about the situation of conflict victims and these states’ obligation towards them. “Imagine surviving the horrors of a war, only for your father, mother, siblings or children to go missing. What happens to those who remain when a family member is lost, not to death or relocation but to an enforced disappearance or having gone missing? How do the people left behind cope with that tragedy and move on,” he said.Bhandari’s father, Tej Bahadur, a former teacher, was arrested from Besisahar, headquarters of Lamjung district, on December 31, 2001, during the state of emergency. He was detained by a joint team of security forces commanded by then Deputy Superintendent of Police Pitambar Adhikari, according to the complaint filed at the disappearance commission. Tej Bahadur was blindfolded, handcuffed, and tortured in the street before being taken into custody, and was never seen again. Like Bhandari, thousands of families of the victims of enforced disappearances and other human rights violations have continuously been fighting for justice for around two decades, but successive governments and political parties have paid little attention to justice delivery. Records at the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons show as many as 3,223 complaints of enforced disappearances implicating either security forces or the Maoists have been lodged at the commission. The commission has identified 2,494 cases falling under its jurisdiction for investigation. Similarly, 63,718 complaints have been registered with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Human rights defenders say a conflict victim demanding justice from the UN Security Council is a significant step. “Bhandari’s address will definitely build pressure to move the transitional justice process forward. His statement has been officially recorded,” Mohna Ansari, a former member of the National Human Rights Commission, told the Post. “It might not have immediate results, but Nepal might face questions at the UN forums like the Universal Periodic Review.”Nepal’s transitional justice process has been paralysed since July 2022, when the government decided to extend the terms of two commissions without retaining their chairpersons and members. Despite the government’s claim that the amendment bill to the Transitional Justice Act would be endorsed by October 2022, which would also open the door for recruiting new office bearers, there has been no progress in amending the Act.The major political parties, despite making several attempts, have been unable to find a meeting point on the bill though there has been some progress.After year-long discussions, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives has narrowed down the differences in the bill. However, the House panel had been struggling to decide whether to categorise arbitrary killings or all killings except those that occurred in clashes as serious violations of human rights. It had also been unable to decide what happens in case the victims of human rights violations refuse to reconcile and demand punishment for the perpetrators. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal administration, through the national budget presented on May 28, has decided to set up a one-billion-rupee peace fund to provide relief and compensation to the victims. The government also has also announced to expedite the transitional justice process in the upcoming fiscal year. However, the bill has not been discussed since the formation of the UML-Maoist coalition on March 4. It is not known when the parliamentary committee will start discussing the amendment bill. Om Prakash Mishra, former Supreme Court chief justice, leads the committee formed to recommend the names of the office bearers of two commissions, but without the Act being amended, it has not commenced its work.Also addressing the UN Security Council, Lok Bahadur Thapa, Nepal’s permanent resident to the UN, said the country is committed to delivering justice to the victims by adopting its own homegrown and nationally-led process. “We have two transitional commissions to investigate the complaints. Similarly, the parliament is working on the amendment to the transitional justice law as directed by the Supreme Court,” he said. \nNepal is a de facto caste-apartheid state. A 2007 Human Rights Watch report on the “untouchables” of India observed, “The only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid in South Africa.” The HRW has declared caste discrimination a form of “hidden apartheid”—an apt observation for Nepal as well.In the past years, caste hatred and exclusion have become more concealed yet pervasive in the Himalayan region; caste has also spread its tentacles in the global diaspora. Last month, Amnesty International criticised the government’s utter apathy and lack of accountability on the persistent plight of Dalits. The communist-populist alliance in government doesn’t seem to heed the call for change. This is clear from recently announced government policies, programmes and budgets for the fiscal year 2024-25. The authorities are bent on keeping caste hierarchy and untouchability sacred and solid. Budget for ‘Dalit skills’On March 21, 2022, attending a Dalit function in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that he was making a big announcement for the dignity and freedom of the “untouchables”. So much so that, he said, they would not forget it in over a century. He hasn’t made his supposedly phenomenal Dalit project explicit, but some Dalits still haven’t given up their hopes. Something came with this year’s budget for the Dalit community: Rs200 million to enhance Dalits’ traditional skills to create employment and promote their livelihood. This small yet seemingly significant budget has buoyed some Dalits. After all, as everybody says, something is better than nothing. However, I’m sceptical about the effectiveness of the Dalit-centred budget. Is it a big enough pot of money to significantly impact the target population? Most people would say “No”. Even some prominent Dalit NGO personalities close to the governing parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount. Equally, are Dalits the only beneficiaries of this new scheme? I don't think so. The details of the intended 200-million project haven’t been developed yet. But it seems many non-Dalits will also get the support, especially those close to the ruling parties and leaders. There are at least two reasons for my understanding. First is the very name of the entity the government plans to establish to use that money: A separate body called the “Dalit, Neglected and Oppressed Class Upliftment and Development Corporation.” The use of so many words is likely intended to involve the beneficiaries from different castes and social groups. My suspicion stems from the second fact: In today’s Nepal, traditional Dalit skills—such as goldsmithing, tailoring, woodworking, and shoemaking—are no longer exclusively practised by Dalits. Once commercialised, many castes including the apex groups, have started these trades. So, skill enhancement projects will probably not be offered only to Dalits. I am not suggesting Dalits should have exclusive rights over these essential skills. It is neither practical nor proper to make such a case. My point is that it is probably wrong to think that the budget is for the betterment of Dalits. Untouched untouchabilityI have a serious objection to the utter lack of sensitivity towards the problems of Dalits, mainly the persistent practice of untouchability (hidden apartheid) in government policies, programmes and the budget. There is no single statement in the policies that mentions untouchability, let alone try to address it. The same applies to the state and local authorities under the federal system. The biggest irony is found in the Karnali Province, where the Province Head, Tilak Pariyar, is a Dalit man with a long history of fighting against the state as part of the Maoist movement, with ending caste oppression as a primary goal. On May 23, he presented 84-point policies and programmes of the province. Study it in detail, and aside from lip service here and there, there is no serious concern about the situation of Dalits in Karnali who have been facing caste humiliation and violence like nowhere else in the country. Yet the authorities seem totally blind to the realities! Recommended policy objectives What should a responsible government do, both in Kathmandu and Karnali? First, the federal capital should become sensitive towards the plight of Dalits, who suffer tremendously due to popular beliefs and practices of ritual impurity. Then, the federal capital should design a national policy framework that could be followed by the lower authorities.On a Sunday press meet, Caste Watch Network (CWN), a newly launched Dalit campaign group, recommended two fundamental policy objectives for tackling the complex problem of untouchability.First, the state should introduce new laws and policies—sticks and carrots—to enforce the constitutional and legal provisions against untouchability. It could, for example, forge a policy of immediately suspending government officials guilty of excluding and humiliating Dalits. Elderly people who discriminate against Dalits could be deprived of their elderly pensions for two years or so. Any temple practising Dalit exclusion could be deprived of state support in the form of money and sacred offerings and sacrificial animals (yes, even the historical and famous temples like Gorakhkali and Manakamana do practise a form of social exclusion). The second important policy objective would be to reform the religion. Some people frown at my suggestions about initiating religious and cultural reform, which they think takes many decades, if not centuries.While we cannot easily rewrite casteist texts like Manusmriti and Parasaramriti, it is possible to achieve the reformation of some religious beliefs and practices over time. For that, the secular state should stand firm against religious dogma and formulate proper laws and implement them. If no religious and/or cultural reform were possible at all, we would still be burning our mothers and sisters and other women alive on the sati pyres. If reform weren’t possible, we wouldn’t see a section of Bahuns drinking alcohol and consuming pork, and, as alluded to earlier, engaging in tailoring, drumming, shoemaking and goldsmithing. Upper castes have deceived Dalits. They have forced religious and cultural transformations in areas that benefit them materially and in other ways. And they have been opposed to the reform of those areas of religious and cultural traditions that would ensure equal rights for Dalits. For example, a Bahun doesn’t become polluted by drinking and drumming; these transgressions do not anger his deities. But he thinks he and his family, lineage and other deities and spirits become polluted if a drummer enters his house. Religious-cultural reform is not as tough as it seems. Governments and authorities at all levels should introduce new laws and policies and spend large sums to change the spiritual, religious and cultural spheres. Without this, we cannot do away with untouchability. \nThe caretaker Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is all set to take the oath of office for the third constitutive term on Sunday evening, with the invited South Asian leaders to witness the ceremony. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak. \nFollowing the Supreme Court's annulment of the Oli government's Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land swap, opposition parties have accused the CPN-UML of \"policy corruption,\" leading to defensive maneuvers from the UML and calls for an investigation.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n[Crucial Event Description] occurred, leading to [Consequence].\nThe Araniko Project, through Mandarin primary sources, explores Nepal-China relations, emphasizing language proficiency and historical understanding for comprehensive insights.\nProject Sambad, a platform for in-depth societal and policy-making discussions, held its first edition in Kathmandu on March 14-15.\nTop CPN (Unified Socialist) leaders are preparing for the general convention and lobbying for leadership positions, with former Prime Ministers Nepal and Khanal likely to face off for the party chief role, while consensus on leadership selection is emphasized.\nAmid growing speculations of rifts in the ruling parties, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Monday came to the defence of the government and his ruling partners.Recently, CPN-UML chair KP Oli, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha, who belongs to the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and others have expressed serious disagreements over the annual budget, and the government’s working style and performance. Oli criticised Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun’s budget as favouring “one man, one party”, expressing his concerns over low allocations for the UML-led ministries.On the other hand, speaking at a party function on Friday, Minister Shrestha of the RSP said they would quit the government if they had to make “unnecessary compromises”. “That is why our resignation letters are in our pockets,” he said. “As soon as we start feeling frustrated, we will put in our papers.”These two back-to-back statements by Oli and Shrestha sparked speculations about a growing rift between Oli, Dahal, and other ruling partners.But Prime Minister Dahal, talking to reporters at Bharatpur airport on Monday, said: “He pretended to criticise, he has not genuinely criticised.”“This government will continue until the end of its term. The rumours [about rifts] are unfounded,” said Dahal.The prime minister also subtly responded to the statement made by minister Shrestha, acknowledging that it is typical of the RSP’s stance, but reiterated that the government would complete its full term. “Carrying resignation letters in pocket is the identity of the RSP,” said Dahal. “But that does not mean they will withdraw support.” Dahal also ruled out the possibility of removing Nepal Police IGP Basanta Kunwar from his post. There were some media reports that Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane was trying to remove IGP Kuwar due to some differences. “Recently, I called a meeting of all three security chiefs—of the Nepal Police, the Armed Police Force and the National Investigation Department—and clearly told them to work with high morale. No one is going to remove any security chief,” the prime minister told reporters. “These are all rumours.” Sources close to the prime minister said that UML chairman Oli was also against an abrupt removal of the Nepal Police chief. As rumours about the police chief’s potential removal spread, Nepal Police headquarters issued a statement on Sunday refuting these claims, describing the media reports as baseless. One senior RSP leader told the Post that Minister Shrestha has serious differences with some office-bearers of the Nepal Sports Council and that Shrestha is unhappy with lack of cooperation from bureaucrats and officials. “Both Dahal and Oli understand the RSP’s strength and they don’t want to let us go,” the RSP leader said. “It’s just that some of our friends want to make public the difficulties they faced in the first 100 days in government.” According to Prime Minister Dahal, “Rabiji [Lamichhane] has always said that he leads a force that is different from other parties and if it cannot deliver, it will quit the government.” “So it is not surprising to hear the RSP leaders talk like that. But as far as I understand, the RSP is not quitting the government,” Dahal added. One UML central committee member said that as the leader of the largest coalition partner, Oli has some compulsions, which is why he made such statements. “Some Maoist leaders accused Oli of trying to micromanage the government, which is not true. Our party has given Prime Minister Dahal a free hand and will help him in every step,” the UML central committee member said. Janamat Party chief CK Raut told the Post that there are no substantive differences within the ruling parties and some comments the media have been citing are quite harmless. The prime minister has already asked Raut to join the government. “The government is not in crisis as some sections of the media are reporting. Some innocuous statements have been blown out of proportion,” said Raut, whose party is preparing to join the government after the budget’s parliamentary approval. At Oli’s suggestion, Raut was offered the post of foreign minister in a cabinet reshuffle, according to sources. But Raut remains undecided. “Nothing has been finalised,” said Raut. “As far as my joining the government is concerned, I am in favour of supporting the government from the outside. But some of our friends will join.”  \nShould non-governmental organisations be allowed in legislative committee deliberations? This age-old question has divided experts and legislators. While NGOs have long been active in Nepal’s lawmaking process, controversy flared anew when NGO representatives were found attending Sunday’s session of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament without the knowledge of many lawmakers. The committee was scheduled to discuss the federal civil code amendment bill with expert input from Umesh Mainali, the former chief of the Public Service Commission. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane was also present at the meeting. However, the meeting took an unexpected turn when lawmakers noticed an elaborate breakfast and lunch arrangement, a departure from usual tea and simple fare. This led to questions about the sponsorship.Upon noticing the breakfast arrangement in the committee hall, Nepali Congress lawmaker Hridaya Ram Thani approached the committee president for clarification. It was revealed that the breakfast was arranged by an NGO, whose representatives were present in the meeting hall, leading to an abrupt adjournment of the meeting without any agenda being discussed.“After knowing that the lunch was sponsored by an NGO, Home Minister Lamichhane left the meeting hall,” Thani told the Post. Before leaving, Lamichhane also questioned the committee chair stating that it was unacceptable to hold a meeting with the breakfast sponsored by an NGO, Thani said, quoting Lamichhane. The National Forum for Parliamentarians on Population and Development (NFPPD), an NGO, had sponsored the breakfast and lunch for lawmakers. Two representatives of the NGO, Ram Guragain and Arinika Rai, were present in the committee meeting hall. Amidst the disruption, committee members raised questions about the role of Ramhari Khatiwada, the Congress lawmaker who leads the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, concerning the NGO’s catering arrangements.But Khatiwada denied any involvement. “I was not aware of the presence of the NGO representatives in the meeting, or of the breakfast arrangement,” Khatiwada told the Post. “After we knew about it, we cancelled the meeting.” “Though other parliamentary committees might allow NGO representatives to attend meetings, our committee does not permit such things,” added Khatiwada. However, CPN-UML lawmaker Prithvi Subba Gurung dismissed the issue. “If necessary, people from various walks of life can be invited to the committee to discuss various agenda,” Gurung told the Post. “There was no reason for disruption.” Mainali, who was invited for his expert input to Sunday’s committee meeting, echoed Gurung and said various stakeholders can participate in committee discussions, but they are excluded when the committee engages in agenda-specific discussions. “In my understanding, the controversy arose not due to the participation of the NGO’s representatives, but because of the breakfast and lunch they arranged,” Mainali told the Post. However, the committee member and lawmaker of Congress, Ishwari Devi Neupane, has a different view. Neupane argues that the presence of NGO representatives could influence a forum dedicated to formulating state laws. “If we allow representatives of an NGO into committee meetings, other NGOs might seek similar permission, and this could impact the lawmaking process,” Neupane told the Post. “That is why we questioned the presence of the NGO that sponsored today’s breakfast and lunch.” Neupane stressed that while agendas can be openly discussed with the representatives of civil society and NGOs outside the committee hall, inviting them to committee meetings is a wrong practice. However, NFPPD representative Guragain, who was present at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee meeting, said his organisation directly deals with parliamentarians and is often invited to such meetings. “We participated in Sunday’s discussion because we have been taking part in discussions in other committees as well,” Guragain told the Post. “We had an invitation letter to the meeting from the parliamentary committee.”However, former minister Ramesh Nath Pandey says incorporating the agendas of INGOs and NGOs into the lawmaking process is wrong and such practice must end. Pandey said such influences were more visible during the constitution-drafting process. “External elements are present not only during the drafting of policy papers, but also in the workings of sensitive institutions and law drafting. As a result, our decision-making process is becoming ineffective,” Pandey said. “If lawmakers acknowledge and rectify their past mistakes, things would improve.”  \nWhat’s cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party? Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government?Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government.Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises.Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet.After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently.“We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post.Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam.“The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.”After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls.During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said.“However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.”Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K.The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television.“Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.”But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.” \nCPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli once again vented his ire at the budget for the new fiscal year on Saturday, fuelling speculations of growing discord among the ruling parties.On May 29, the day after Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun read out the national budget in Parliament, Oli lambasted some of the provisions and said the fiscal plan was of “one minister and one party”.Oli and his party were unhappy with some of the provisions, including the distribution of funds to the conflict victims, who mostly are CPN (Maoist Centre) members. Oli’s UML is the largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition government.Addressing the UML parliamentary party meeting on Saturday, Oli said the budget had failed to address the concerns of the poor. “Our duty is to stop poverty and lead the country towards development. If the poor are not benefitting and development is not happening, how can we satisfy them?” Oli wondered.He also asked the party’s ministers to see the status of the ministries they lead. “We have to keep track of the budget allocated to the ministries led by the UML,” Oli said, directing the party’s lawmakers to openly discuss the budget in the party and in Parliament.He also accused the government of failing to pay enough attention to development activities. “Our party joined the government to stop poverty and advance development. If that is not happening, how can we be satisfied?” Oli said.Stating that the percentage of the poor had now increased, Oli claimed that poverty had been reduced significantly during his premiership, which lasted over three years until July 2021.A UML central committee leader told the Post that Oli has already expressed his dissatisfaction with the budget with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Oli’s second instance of expressing his displeasure with the budget signals a growing misunderstanding between the two leaders, UML leaders said. Oli wants more spending in the sectors of entrepreneurship and infrastructure.He urged the UML ministers to study the budget but directed the party’s lawmakers not to comment on it on social media platforms. “It’d be better to express your concerns and comments at party meetings,” Oli told UML lawmakers.Also on Saturday, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the opposition Nepali Congress, raised questions about the government’s activities. The UML is in government, but the party is acting as if it is not a part of it, he said. “The UML first sent junior party leaders to the Cabinet. Now it has stopped owning up the government’s activities,” Thapa shared his observation.When the UML goes to people, it takes no responsibility for the government’s works, he said. “They are acting as though the UML was not consulted while the Maoists prepared the budget.”The party had deputed former finance minister Bishnu Poudel to provide inputs and suggestions for the budget. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nDays after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said. \nDead bodies of a man and a woman were found on a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, located on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.According to the Kathmandu Valley Police Office, the bodies were spotted approximately 200 metres down the hill from the Kathmandu-Dakshinkali road.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Raj Mainali said that the preliminary investigation suggests they died in an accident, as a crashed motorcycle was found near the bodies.Mainali said a disaster management team of Nepal Police is working to retrieve the bodies from the hill. He said locals informed the police after spotting the bodies on Wednesday evening.The police said the deceased woman is a 32-year-old resident of Changunarayan Municipality-5, while the man is yet to be identified. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said on Tuesday that despite Nepal’s negligible contribution to global emissions, the country has been disproportionately hit by the adverse effects of climate change.He urged the global lenders for climate justice and compensation for the loss and damage incurred due to circumstances that were and are beyond Nepal’s control.“For the least-developed countries like Nepal, debt concessionality [concessional lending] is critical,” said Dahal, speaking at the 21st replenishment meeting of the International Development Association (IDA21). For the first time in Nepal, the consultative meeting is being held over four days. Replenishing IDA’s resources will be a vital topic of the meeting, which comes at the midpoint of a funding cycle concluding in December 2024—when donors commit to contributions for July 2025 to June 2028.The third IDA21 meeting in Kathmandu brought together officials from 65 donor governments and representatives of borrowing member countries to discuss the proposed IDA21 policy focus areas—people, planet, prosperity, infrastructure, and digitalisation. Donors meet every three years to replenish IDA resources and review its policy framework. Officials from the donor governments and representatives of borrowing member countries ensure that IDA’s policy and financing frameworks are responsive to the country's needs and current challenges.They will also look at financing scenarios—the level of donor contributions required to support these scenarios—and assess the financing needs of countries supported by IDA.After years of promises of new climate funding, the developing world is coming to grips with a disappointing reality that not enough funding is coming to address the challenges of climate change.Nepal's diverse geo-climatic system, which combines heavy monsoons, steep terrain, and remoteness, renders the country vulnerable to natural disasters.According to the National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, released by the National Statistics Office recently, the economic losses in both farm and off-farm sectors over the last five years, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say that due to extreme climate behaviour, farmers might lose the basis of their livelihoods, and even those who have escaped poverty may be dragged back into it.“We are vulnerable to multiple crises. The climate crisis could reverse our hard-won development gains,” said the prime minister.IDA is the part of the World Bank that invests in the future of people and the planet, with projects across 75 countries. Established in 1960, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing grants and zero- to low-interest loans for programmes that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions.Dahal said that Nepal has faced significant challenges, including devastating earthquakes, disasters, the Covid pandemic, and economic slowdown, which have caused substantial output losses and hindered the country’s progress towards economic prosperity. “To ensure sustainable and resilient growth, we are adopting our homegrown Green Resilient Inclusive Development (GRID) approach, prioritising ten key transition sectors and actions to be accomplished over the next decade,” said Dahal, showcasing Nepal's determination to overcome the challenges of climate change.He said Nepal’s development priority and GRID approach align with the World Bank's evolution roadmap and global challenge programmes. He said that IDA’s commitment to strengthening country-driven models will empower countries to take ownership of their development agendas, foster inclusive stakeholder engagement, and build robust institutions and systems. “Realising this fact, we wish to work closely with IDA and other stakeholders to streamline this approach in the IDA21 cycle.”Nepal has been an active IDA borrower for over six decades. During this period, IDA has been a significant source of development finance for Nepal and has delivered impact. “With this support, Nepal has achieved significant outcomes in infrastructure building and social development overall,” Dahal said, instilling hope for a brighter future with continued support from IDA. “We would like to request you to continue the same moving forward. I agree that we have capacity constraints in a new federal context. Project execution performance is slowing, and spending is low,” Dahal said.“We may need to restructure our policy framework, but policy change cannot occur overnight in a democratic system. That's why you are here to support us with patience to continue our development aspiration to increase the speed and impact of IDA and to build a common hope.” The prime minister said Nepal's key strengths include its strategic location between two of Asia's largest economies, abundant hydropower resources, thriving tourism and agribusiness sectors, and a young, hardworking population.Sheku Sambadeen Sesay, the independent co-chair of IDA21 Replenishment, said IDA works similarly across 75 countries worldwide. “If I look at my own country, Sierra Leone, IDA has contributed a lot. The civil war ravaged Sierra Leone from 1991 to 2002 and destroyed the country's infrastructure, including its health systems.Sesay said that IDA moved in swiftly with the construction work, and today, at least, the country is at a stage where it has the conditions for take-off.Sesay sees IDA as a complete package as it brings technical assistance and knowledge, builds capacity and affects policy change. IDA contributes as a package, mostly co-financing with countries that can't afford high interest rates.Axel van Trotsenburg, senior managing director of Development Policy and Partnership at the World Bank, said the next few days would be crucial. “This forum will help the beneficiary countries embrace very proactive results-oriented programmes. It will be for the donor countries to see how that package could facilitate the maximum generosity when the pledging comes,” Trotsenburg said.He said it would be up to the bank to see how IDA can do more and contribute even further to a successful outcome. \nNow Nepali customers can personalise their mobile number by choosing the last six digits that resonate with their hearts. Whether it's their birthday, the date they first met their partner, their vehicle number, or any other significant moment, Ncell has launched the ‘Sadhain ON’ special number. The company said that customers can also gift such special numbers to their loved ones. “In this scheme, mobile numbers start with the number range 9705.Customers who wish to own such special numbers can craft the last six digits to make it uniquely theirs.

This was for the first time in years that the Kathmandu Valley was seeing motorist queues.The situation arose due to a protest launched by petroleum transport workers who stopped supplying fuel to private pumps. They were protesting against their employers—petroleum dealers—accusing them of not implementing the minimum wage for workers as fixed by the government and excluding them from the social safety net. According to petroleum workers, petroleum transportation is one of the most dangerous jobs, yet lacks a social safety net.The protest, which began Friday, took a nasty turn after private petrol pumps ran out of fuel on Monday. Frantic motorists then started queuing up at state-owned petrol pumps. Videos and photos immediately went viral on social media, showing never-ending lines in front of petrol stations owned by Nepal Police in Naxal and other fuel stations.“We’ve been waiting for an hour,” said Saroj Karki, whose motorbike was already running empty.“This is totally frustrating. How can the government be so irresponsible,” said Karki, who was waiting at the Bhadrakali petrol pump run by the Nepal Army on Monday afternoon. Karki, a sales manager for a private company, said that he was scheduled to attend two meetings in different places. “It's 12:30, and the queue hasn’t moved at all. I don’t know what to do.” However, the streets of the Valley saw less traffic pressure on Monday due to a public holiday. Since Friday, most private petrol pumps have hung up “no petrol” signs. The issue was resolved late Monday afternoon after the government decided to form a committee to address the grievances of the petroleum transport workers. There are more than 2,100 petroleum transport workers in the country. People also expressed frustrations on social media. “One thing I like about the proliferation of electric vehicles in Nepal is that we will not be held ransom by different cartels of labour, transporters, fuel station owners and an inefficient, corrupt, constantly No Oil Corporation (NOC)!” Sujeev Shakya wrote on X. Ajay Das posted a video on X showing a long queue of motorists. He wrote, “This is not Kathmandu traffic, it’s the queue at Naxal Police petrol pump this morning.” On August 18 last year, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security implemented the monthly wage of workers, except for tea estate workers, at Rs17,300 as per Section 106 of the Labour Act, 2017. The monthly basic salary has been fixed at Rs10,820, and the dearness allowance at Rs6,480. The daily wage has been fixed at Rs668 and Rs89 per hour. Similarly, the hourly wage for part-time workers has been fixed at Rs95 per hour.But the petroleum transport workers said they have not received the hiked monthly wages and allowances. “We tried to settle the issue on Sunday morning but were not successful,” said Manoj Kumar Thakur, deputy director of Nepal Oil Corporation, the state-owned oil monopoly.The Kathmandu Valley consumes 700 kiloliters of petrol and 800 kiloliters of diesel daily. This requires 75-100 petroleum tankers to supply petrol and diesel from Thankot depo to different pumps in the Valley. On Saturday, the oil supplier reduced the prices of petroleum products. Petrol price was cut by Rs3 per litre to Rs165 per litre, while diesel and kerosene became cheaper by Re1 each, to Rs152 per litre.“Despite the monthly minimum salary of Rs17,300 determined by the Labour Act, we are receiving Rs8,000 to Rs10,000 per month. Only a few get Rs15,000, and that’s too below the government-set wages,” said Ishwar Lama, president of Nepal Petroleum Tank Divers Association.“We have not even been included in the social security scheme,” Lama said. “We are hopeful that our demand will be addressed this time, or else we will launch a nationwide protest.”According to the Nepal Oil Corporation, petroleum transport drivers stopped unloading fuel, petrol, and diesel from the corporation's Thankot depot on Sunday morning. The depot is open from 9 am to 5 pm.Lama said that during a meeting held at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, they agreed to the government’s proposal to form a committee to address the issues raised by the workers. The committee has been given 15 days to submit the report. The petroleum transport workers have put forth a seven-point demand.The committee is led by the deputy managing director of Nepal Oil Corporation with representatives from the Industry Ministry, Nepal Petroleum Tanker Drivers Association, Nepal Transportation Workers Association and All Nepal Petroleum Workers’ Union.Lilendra Pradhan, president of Nepal Petroleum Dealers National Association, said that petroleum tanker drivers have not been included in the social security scheme as they have been compelled to work without appointment letters. Thakur of Nepal Oil Corporation alleged that petroleum dealers were not providing salaries and benefits to petroleum transport workers, and they were not even included in social safety schemes. “As petroleum dealers are appointed by the corporation, we have to play the role of facilitator to resolve the issue.”On June 11, the Nepal Petroleum Tank Drivers Association had issued an ultimatum to the Nepal Oil Corporation. As part of the protest, petroleum transport workers began protesting on Friday by wearing black bands around their arms.The tank drivers' association has demanded that all drivers be provided appointment letters as per the Labour Act and salaries as determined by the government. \nThe Department of Drug Administration has suspended the sales and distribution of Biotax 1gm, an antibiotic injection manufactured by an Indian firm, citing serious health risks.According to the department, the national drug regulatory body, laboratory testing of the ‘Biotax 1gm’ batch F300460, manufactured by Indian pharma company Zydus Healthcare Ltd, revealed that the drug was not in compliance with the production specifications.“We have directed the manufacturing company, importers and distributors to immediately suspend sales, import and distribution of the said medicine, until further notice,” said Pramod KC, spokesperson at the department. “Some serious issues have been detected in the said antibiotic. Decisions about further actions will be taken once the investigation is completed.”Biotax 1gm injection is an antibiotic medicine used to treat bacterial infections, including those of the brain, lungs, ear, urinary tract, skin, soft tissues, bones and joints, blood, and heart. It is also used to prevent infections during surgery.According to the department, which carried out the testing in its own laboratory, BIOTAX-1gm batch F300460 is not safe for use and could risk patients’ lives.KC said that the decision to suspend the sales of the injection was made to ensure patient safety and would not affect the treatment, as other drugs with the same composition are available in the market.“Injection of the same composition manufactured by other companies are available in the market,” said KC. “The suspension of sales will not affect the treatment of patients.”Suspending and recalling substandard drugs from the market is routine work and part of the department's risk reduction measures. Officials said that several medicines found to be substandard have also been suspended from sales and distribution or recalled in the past. However, it is not known if all those substandard drugs were successfully recalled or some were sold to patients, as the department does not have the capacity to ensure timely recess of all substandard medicines.The regulatory agency regularly collects drugs through random sampling methods from pharmacies across the country and tests them in its own laboratory to ensure compliance with quality standards.DDA officials admit that due to understaffing, they cannot always monitor if all those drugs have been recalled or not.The department publishes a notice on its website asking respective companies to recall those drugs as soon as possible. However, most of the time, those substandard drugs have already been sold out by the time the notices are published, as it takes months, mainly due to understaffing, for the department to conduct tests in its laboratory. \nAs all efforts to control the vectors spreading the dengue virus have failed, health authorities in Nepal have shifted focus to case management. As there is no specific treatment for dengue, officials said they are planning to train doctors to provide supportive care to seriously ailing dengue patients.“We have been working to train doctors serving at state-run health facilities to treat dengue patients,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We hope the training will help doctors manage cases more effectively.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,175 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 122. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, increasing numbers of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as the outbreak of the virus is reported every month including in the winter months.Health authorities in Nepal claimed that lessons from managing Covid cases would help them combat other outbreaks, but the massive infections and spread of the dengue virus before the onset of the monsoon cast doubt on these claims.“Every year, scores die and hundreds of thousands get infected from the dengue virus, but no agency in the country is doing much on disease prevention,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “There are three tiers of government in the country, and the relevant agency in each government—federal, provincial and local—shifts responsibility to another. When you ask the agency under the local level, they say they are not there to kill mosquitoes.”Experts say health authorities have done little to cut down on the risks, except counting the number of infected people and issuing statements. The public, too, has become less vigilant about dengue infections, they sayAccording to entomologists, reducing the spread of the dengue virus is impossible without coordinated efforts from all relevant agencies and individuals.“Several preemptive measures, including a search-and-destroy campaign of mosquito breeding sites, are necessary to curb the spread of the virus,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “People should be made aware of the risks, so awareness drives should be launched. Authorities should deploy community workers to inspect households to find and destroy mosquito breeding grounds.”Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death. \nChildren aged between five and 11 years with compromised immunity will be administered the Covid vaccine, according to health officials.The Covax facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has agreed to provide 100,000 doses of the children’s vaccine, and supply will start in the last week of June, according to officials at the Ministry of Health and Population.“These 100,000 doses are part of the 2.5 million doses, which Covax had agreed to supply to Nepal in 2024,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Children between five and 11 having underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.”Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.The Covax facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine, which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population.Officials said that Nepal will receive 1.6 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccine by the end of this month, including the children’s vaccine, from Covax. The rest of the doses of the monovalent vaccine to be received later will be administered to the adult population in all provinces of the country. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid.The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components: the original virus strain and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nAt least one case of cholera, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, has been confirmed in Kathmandu.According to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, a 62-year-old man from Makwanpur district, who had been admitted with severe diarrhoea some two weeks ago, tested positive for the deadly disease.The man is said to have been residing in Kathmandu for a long time.“The health condition of the patient was serious when he was brought to our hospital,” said a health worker serving at the Hospital’s Emergency Department, asking not to be named, as the official was not authorised to speak to the media. “The stool test confirmed a cholera infection.”According to health workers at the hospital, Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in stool samples of infected patients.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.The Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak in the monsoon of 2022 in which 77 cholera-positive cases were confirmed. Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.”Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.”Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago. An Indian national who is a truck driver was admitted to the Sukraraj Hospital at that time.“We had mobilised our team to investigate the source of the outbreak,” said Sapkota. Doctors warn that concealing outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and failing to investigate their sources and inform the public about the risks can prove counterproductive, as the deadly bacteria keep spreading in communities if preventative measures are not taken.Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected with them every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main catalysts for the spread of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City that were highly affected by the outbreak. In October 2021, a Vibrio cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu district killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man.Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts failed to curb the infection.The World Health Organisation says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera.A combination of careful survey, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nThe Nepali cricket team will return home from the T20 World Cup with their heads held high despite yet another near miss in pulling off their first-ever win over a Test nation in Kingstown. After being agonisingly close to capping one of the biggest upsets in cricket history against South Africa two days ago, the Rhinos, led by the tournament’s youngest captain Rohit Paudel, had Bangladesh, another full member nation, on the ropes with their eye-popping bowling display on Monday.Nepal opted to field first after winning the toss and wrapped up the Tigers for a low total of 106, with Sompal Kami, Dipendra Singh Airee, Rohit Paudel and Sandeep Lamichhane all dominating with the ball with two wickets apiece.They had come within two runs of overhauling a slightly bigger target against the Proteas, and the 107-run target was something they would have settled for. But Nepal’s batters could not cope with the bowling masterclass of Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Mustafizur Rahman, and were eventually all out for 85 against a Bangladeshi side that needed at least one point to ensure progress to the Super Eight stage.“As a bowling unit, we bowled really well. As a batting unit, we could have done better, especially the top order batters. We could have batted tighter,” Paudel said at the presentation following the loss.“Bangladesh bowled really well with the new ball and we were under pressure after that. They were asking us challenging questions. We built a little partnership after that, but top order batters could have done better and taken more responsibility.”It was a game of bowlers at the Arnos Vale Ground that assisted both spinners and seamers.Fast bowler Sompal Kami struck with the first ball of the innings to dismiss Tanzid Hasan for a golden duck, setting the tone for Nepal.Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (four off five) was the next to go when Dipendra Singh Airee bowled him in the next over.Kami then got rid of Litton Das (10 off 12) in the fourth over, before Towhid Hridoy (9 off 7) fell to Paudel after hitting two fours, which left Bangladesh reeling at 31-4 at the end of the powerplay.Mahmudullah and Shakib Al Hasan tried to rebuild the innings, limping past 50, but Bangladesh found themselves on the back foot again when Mahmudullah (13 off 13) was frustratingly run out due to miscommunication.Paudel then got another breakthrough wicket of Bangladesh, trapping Shakib (17 off 22) with a sharp turning ball, before Lamichhane piled more pressure with two crucial wickets of Tanzim (three off five) and Jaker Ali (12 off 26) that also gave him his 100th T20I wickets in his 54th match for Nepal.But Rishad Hossain added 13 runs off seven balls and Taskin played 12 not out off 15 balls for the last two wickets, which would prove crucial in the end.-What went wrong against Bangladesh?-The target seemed achievable. But Nepal repeated the same mistake with the bat. They failed to make maximum use of the powerplay and their strike rotation was poor. And by the time they were in the stage of taking more risks in the chase, it was already too late.Against South Africa, when they pushed the game to the last ball, a sense of belief had popped up that Nepal had saved their best with the bat for the crucial meetings after having struggled for much of the year.But against Bangladesh, they collapsed sooner and were only able to add 24 runs from the powerplay after Tanzim ripped apart the top order including a double-wicket maiden in the third over.By the time Tanzim bowled his fourth over in the seventh of the innings, he had thrown 21 dots and taken four of the first five wickets —that included the wickets of Kushal Bhurtel (four off eight), Anil Sah (0), Paudel (one off six) and Sundeep Jora (one off eight)—leaving Nepal a mountain to climb.Tanzim’s 21 dot balls was the most by any bowler in a men’s T20 World Cup match.Kushal Malla (27 off 40) and Dipendra Singh Airee (25 off 31) indeed started the recovery but Nepal needed 23 balls to finally break the boundary drought as they limped past 50 after 12 overs.Nepal raised the tempo in the 16th over when Malla hit Mahmudullah for a six and a four to complete a fifty-run partnership with Airee for the sixth wicket, which took them to 77-5. They now needed 30 off the last four overs, which raised hopes of an upset.A successful chase was still viable for Nepal but inexperience caught up with them.Mustafizur, who had taken the wicket of Aasif Sheikh to cap an excellent powerplay for Bangladesh, returned for his third over and gave Nepal another nightmare.Nepal were able to eke out just one run off Mustafizur in the 17th and the loss of Malla in the 16.4 was something the Rhinos could not afford.Airee hit Taskin with a six in the first ball of the 18th over and added one more in the 17.3 to close the gap on the target but it was the last run Nepal could manage.After Taskin dismissed Gulsan Jha, Mustafizur bowled five dots in a row in the 19th over before getting Airee’s wicket that ended Nepal’s hopes of ending the tournament on a high note.Shakib then completed the team’s hat-trick dismissing Kami and Bohara in the successive balls in the 20th over.Paudel was left disappointed with the way Nepal batted against Bangladesh.“We need to step up… need to know where to score runs and how to assess conditions. In the field and with the ball, we are up to the mark, we need to improve with the bat,” Paudel said.-‘Sense of belonging’-Nepal exited the World Cup without a win in Group D. But their spirited fight in the last two games, especially against South Africa, sent a message that Nepal belong with the elites and could be joining their ranks soon.“This team has great potential. There are a lot of positives to take, especially the way we played at the Asia Cup and now the World Cup against good teams,” Paudel said. “So I think the sense of belonging is there in the team.”Paudel reiterated that Nepal need more exposure against full-member nations if they are to grow and improve. Nepal have had the opportunity to play only a handful of games against Test nations. In the World Cup warm-ups as well, they were matched against associate nations Canada and the United States.“And if you back this team and play good cricket with good teams like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and everyone else… if you play with them [regularly], I think there will be improvement in us.”One more thing Nepal will regret is their six-wicket defeat against familiar rivals Netherlands in their opening game. A win against the Dutch could have scripted a whole new tournament for the Rhinos. The no result against Sri Lanka also contributed to Nepal’s poor opening at the World Cup.But Nepal will have to work on their batting if they are to announce their emergence on the global stage. \nBangladesh defeated Nepal by 21 runs in their last match of the T20 World Cup played at the Arnos Vale Stadium in St. Vincent, West Indies.Chasing a modest 107-target by Bangladesh, the Rhinos were bowled out for 85 runs. With this Nepal have been knocked out of the T20 World Cup winless from the group stage.Nepal’ s innings faltered from the start in the run chase.Nepal’s top order struggled, with key batters Kushal Bhurtel and Anil Sah falling cheaply for four runs and a duck respectively.Despite a fighting 27 off 40 balls knock by Kushal Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee’s 25 off 31, Nepal's batting lineup collapsed under pressure as they were bundled out for just 85 runs. Tanzim Hasan Sakib struck early, taking the wicket of Nepali opener Bhurtel. Sakib claimed four wickets for just seven runs in his four-over spell. Mustafizur Rahman was equally impressive, taking three wickets for seven runs. Shakib Al Hasan chipped in with two wickets for nine runs, sealing the fate of Nepal's innings at 85 in 19.2 overs.Earlier, Bangladesh were confined to 106 runs in 19.3 overs.Shakib Al Hasan’ s 17 off 22 balls was the top score, with Litton Das and Mahmudullah contributing 10 and 13 runs respectively.Nepal's bowlers delivered a commendable performance, with Sompal Kami, Dipendra Singh Airee, Rohit Paudel, and Sandeep Lamichhane each taking two wickets. Sompal Kami took 2 wickets conceding 10 runs and Lamichhane was particularly effective as he conceded just 17 runs in his four-over spell. After the match Rohit Paudel (Nepal skipper) said that as a bowling unit they bowled well but as a batting unit they could have been tighter. “Bangladesh bowled really well and after the first six overs we were four down and it put a lot of pressure on us. The top order batters could have taken more responsibility. I think they bowled really well in the powerplay,” Paudel said. “As a batting unit, we need to step up. We need to understand where to score runs. I think in bowling we were up to the mark but as a batting unit, we need to work a lot.”He said he believed this team has a bright future but needed to work harder. “We will do better in the upcoming World Cups.\" \nWith a bit of luck Nepal’s fairytale victory would have been secured.The country’s hopes of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup ended after they lost to cricketing powerhouse South Africa by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller in their Group D match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent on Saturday.But their spirited performance earned praise worldwide after almost pulling off an upset win over one of the tournament favourites.Fielding first after winning the toss, the Rhinos restricted a strong Proteas team to a subpar 115-7 with their stupendous spin attack as Dipendra Singh Airee and part-time bowler Kushal Bhurtel shared all seven wickets that fell between them on a turning track.But they fell agonisingly short from recording their historic first ever victory over an ICC’s full-member nation after they could only manage 114-7.Despite the heartbreak, Nepal’s performance caught attention worldwide.“A performance to be proud of. Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.”Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them.“Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.”Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!”“Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group. \nGermany thrashed 10-man Scotland 5-1 on Friday with three goals in the first half to make a triumphant start to their Euro 2024 campaign and lay down a marker with the biggest opening game margin of victory in the tournament’s history.The Germans, hunting a record fourth European title and first major trophy after a barren decade, scored through Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and a Kai Havertz penalty before Niclas Fuellkrug and Emre Can added two more late in the second half.Scotland, who had defender Ryan Porteous sent off on the stroke of halftime, got on the scoresheet in the 87th minute courtesy of Antonio Ruediger’s deflected own goal.Julian Nagelsmann’s Germany next face Hungary on Wednesday before taking on Switzerland in their final Group A match.“We played with a lot of intensity and played the right spaces, took some risks and that is why we scored. We played an outstanding first half and we were up 3-0,” Germany captain Ilkay Guendogan said.“That is how we wanted to start. I had a good feeling before the game and I was proved right.”“The start is what we wanted but still the goal we let in showed that all teams have quality and if you don't pay attention you will be punished.”The Scots, who lost Porteous for a studs-up challenge on Guendogan that earned the hosts their penalty, must quickly go back to the drawing board and regroup if they are to make it past the group stage for the first time in a major tournament.POWERFUL STARTThe Germans, who lost their opening matches at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups as well as the previous Euros in 2021, dominated possession from the start with the Scots defending high.That ambitious strategy proved fatal for the visitors, who left far too many open spaces at the back, and it did not take long for the hosts to punish them.Toni Kroos flighted a perfect 30-metre cross for Joshua Kimmich who timed his pass to Wirtz perfectly for the winger to drill home for a 10th minute lead and become the youngest scorer for Germany at a Euros aged 21.With Scotland still recovering, Germany struck again nine minutes later, with Guendogan slipping another ball past the Scottish backline, this time for Havertz on the left, with the forward laying it off for Musiala in the box to rifle home.It was the start all of Germany was hoping for as hundreds of thousands of supporters across several fan zones erupted with joy, but there was more to come with Porteus’ reckless challenge and dismissal conceding a spot kick Havertz easily converted.It was one-way traffic again after the break and Germany added a fourth through substitute Fuellkrug’s fiercely struck shot in the 69th as Scotland coach Steve Clarke, the first man to lead the team to back-to-back Euros, looked on helplessly.“First half, we just got it all wrong really, didn’t show up, weren’t aggressive enough, and we let good players get on the ball,” said Scotland captain Andy Robertson.“Second half, we’re down to 10 men and I thought the lads dug in really well. We have to bounce back quickly because there was lots wrong here and it’s a quick turnaround now.”Scotland, who did not have one effort on or off target, pulled a goal back late on when Ruediger inadvertently headed the ball into his own net but substitute Emre Can then curled home a fine shot in stoppage time for the Germans’ fifth goal.The reeling Scots next play the Swiss on Wednesday. \nNepal blew their chances of qualifying for the Super Eight of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup after losing to South Africa by a single run in a last-over nail-biter at the Arnos Vale Ground in West Indies.The Rhinos had everything on the line and were in need of two runs off the last ball of the game when Gulshan Jha was caught between the wickets by Quinton de Kock.Earlier, the Rhinos put up a great bowling display, restricting South Africa, who were sent to bat first, to a lowly total of 115 runs.Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 runs off 11 balls before being dismissed by Dipendra Singh Airee in 3.4 overs. Kushal Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after.Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks managed to stay on the ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavilion by Airee in 15.3 overs.Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play.Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-over spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs.Despite the easy chase, Nepal found themselves on the losing end, putting up 114 runs at a loss of seven wickets at the end of the stipulated 20 overs.The Rhinos were off to a good start with openers Bhurtel and Aashif Sheikh building a decent first-wicket partnership. However, the tides turned quickly for Nepal as South Africa’s Tabraiz Shamsi struck twice in a single over, dismissing Bhurtel for 13 in 7.2 overs, and captain Rohit Paudel for a duck only two deliveries later.Sheikh stood undeterred, building a half-century partnership with Anil Sah to bring some much-needed relief to the Nepali innings. Sah scored 27 runs, which featured three boundaries and a six, before being caught by Marco Jansen off Aiden Markram.Just as the innings were steadying for the Rhinos, Shamsi struck again, proving a thorn in Nepal’s flesh. Nepal were in need of 18 runs off as many deliveries at the end of 16 overs when they dealt a massive blow, losing Dipendra Singh Airee (6), Aasif Sheikh (42) and Kushal Malla (1) in a span of five balls.Tension ran high as Nepal were still in need of eight runs with an over to spare. Gulshan Jha, who took to the field at number seven, missed twice, narrowing the game down to eight runs with four deliveries in hand.Jha then smashed a boundary. The game was down to two runs off as many balls, but he missed again. With only a single delivery remaining, Jha and his partner Sompal Kami made the run for an equaliser, but the former was run out, ending Nepal’s hopes of competing in the World Cup.For South Africa, Tabraiz Shamsi grabbed four wickets while Aiden Markram also dismissed a Nepali batter. \nIndia faced a severe heatwave with 40,000 heatstroke cases and over 100 deaths, while the northeast experienced floods from heavy rain, killing six and affecting over 160,000.\nNorth Korea and Russia sign defense pact, pledging mutual assistance against attacks, with North Korea declaring an \"alliance\" and \"unconditional support\" for Russia's actions in Ukraine.\nIndia endures extreme weather with severe heatwaves causing deaths in Delhi, while landslides and floods in Assam kill at least 11, including a woman and her three daughters.\nMultiple fatalities, numbering in the hundreds, have occurred during this year's hajj in Mecca due to extreme heat, with Egypt reporting the highest number of deaths.\nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nPrivate hospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, Butwal, and other regions blatantly disregard regulations by neglecting to provide free treatment to underprivileged patients, despite government mandates requiring them to allocate 10% of their beds for such services.\nThe Poet Laureate of the 1950s, Laxmi Prasad Devkota (1909-1959), penned a lyrical essay, “Ke Nepal Sano Chha?” (Is Nepal small?), and claimed that Bharatmatako Mutu (The heart of mother Bharat) was “pretty, quiet and great”. The essayist takes cringeworthy poetic licences to glorify his homeland where “Wagner is using a spade, Shakespeare could be ploughing, Titian and Turner may be tending the sheep, Socrates contemplating in a cave …”! Every country, irrespective of its size, has the right to adore itself if it doesn’t degenerate into collective narcissism. But it’s dangerous to fantasise that someone else will help end its misery or to hallucinate that all others are conspiring to harm its interests. The anxiety that Narendra Modi’s electoral enthronement as a third-term prime minister of the most populous country in the world has caused everywhere is real. A beacon of hope for the freshly freed countries since the 1950s, India was often cited as an exemplar of slow but steady path from exploitative governance to social justice through democratic processes. By re-electing “one of the worst autocratisers” for the third time, albeit with a lower margin, a significant section of Indian voters has shown that it values religious gratification of Hindutva chauvinism much more than its democratic credentials. Nepal was once “the only Hindu Kingdom” of the world, and it’s perhaps understandable that remnants of the ancien régime of the Shah and Rana clan look towards the entrenched Hindutva establishment in New Delhi with a poignant sense of longing and hope. The sadness comes from the realisation that the Hindutva lobby in India doesn’t care much about what happens to the conservative elements in Kathmandu. Hope rekindles whenever a minor functionary of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) makes a promissory statement to support the restoration of “Hindu Rashtra” in Nepal. However, the wishful expectations of Hindutva factions in the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party and the Nepali Congress stand on shaky grounds: Indian foreign policy is dictated by its geostrategic compulsions, geoeconomic considerations and geopolitical options. Cultural diplomacy is merely a tool at the hands of its adroit practitioners. Fears of former Naxals, such as the de facto supremo of the ruling alliance Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli or the degenerate Maoists of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s ilk, appear to be equally unfounded. National interests invariably triumph over ideological considerations in the implementation of foreign policy. The priorities of Modi 3.0 towards Nepal are unlikely to be much different from what they have been since 2015—quiet behind-the-scenes manoeuvres combined with studied indifference in public.Strategic irrelevanceThe Gandhian dreams of self-rule, self-sufficiency, social justice, non-domination and ethical rightness fired the Indian Independence Movement. The Nehruvian pursuit of modernity in political economy laid the foundations of a country emerging from some of the worst excesses of British colonialism. The Ambedkarite idea of India as “a social democracy firmly established on the principles of liberty, equality, fraternity, and humanity” remained an aspiration till the aughties. Meanwhile, revivalists of “Hindu glory” had a completely different idea of India since the early 1920s.The leadership of the Sangh Parivar wanted to replace all secular ambitions with the Savarkarite concept of Hindutva hegemony in a civilisational state of, for, and by the people who had their homeland, motherland, fatherland, and holy land within the Akhand Bharat. When Premier Modi assumed office in 2014, he took care to cloak the Hindutva agenda with economic rhetoric. He managed to dupe some people for almost a decade with an enticing slogan of inclusive development. Back in the saddle with the cobbled majority of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and forced to rely on temperamental partners in the coalition, he has once again begun to repeat his beguiling bombasts of the past.On the domestic front, Premier Modi may be forced to dilute his hardline Hindutva to maintain the cohesion within the NDA. However, the continuation of his team for external affairs shows that Indian foreign policy will stay its course. S. Jaishankar’s suave toughness has been retained by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Speaking at the First Gateway of India Dialogue in 2016 as the top bureaucrat of MEA, Jaishankar closed his speech with a statement of purpose: “A new normal is in the making, one where the business of Indian diplomacy is increasingly business.” Jaishankar will continue to be tasked with procuring petroleum products from Russia, industrial goods from China, advancing military hardware from countries of the West, and managing the contradictions of being simultaneously in the Chinese-dominated BRICS and the US-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. The sophisticated but blunt former bureaucrat shall be the face of Modi 3.0 in the international arena. A scholar, Jaishankar, can elucidate about India being “non-Western” and “not anti-Western”, ignoring the distinction without an inherent difference in the proposition. Multipolarity is an oxymoron, and multi-alignment is just a jargon in the bipolar world of the Cold War II. Despite its geoeconomic handshake with the Russians, the geostrategic foot of Indian diplomacy finds Western grounds firmer and friendlier than its Chinese challengers.Perhaps the former spymaster Ajit Doval will have a more prominent role in geostrategic affairs as the third-time National Security Advisor. He has been elevated to the rank of a Cabinet Minister and put on par with the former secretary of the MEA. When National Security Advisor of the United States Jake Sullivan came to New Delhi on June 17, 2024, he did meet Jaishankar. Still, he held “comprehensive discussion on a broad range of issues” with his counterpart. If Nepal figured at all in their conversations, it probably was connected with countering the Chinese influence in South Asia.Tactical impassivityFrom the legions of the imperial epoch through the armada of the colonial era to the cyber security challenges of the AI age, economic considerations have always remained the main concern of all competing powers. Tall talks of tourism and hydropower notwithstanding, Nepal is essentially a resource-poor country with the export of unskilled and semi-skilled youths to the labour markets of the world as its primary source of income. There is a reason the four pillars of Premier Modi’s economic team—Ambani, Adani, Tata and Jindal—aren’t too keen on investing in the land of Pashupatinath.Competency in science and technology is important in determining the strategic significance of relatively smaller countries. Nepal’s last indigenous innovation was the watermill. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are unlikely to prefer Banepa over Bengaluru in setting up their data management facilities.Nepal can no longer count upon the remaining Bharatmatako Mutu with Premier Modi’s Agnipath scheme on stream, and recruitment of Nepali Gurkhas in suspension. The four-time prime minister of Britain, William Ewart Gladstone (1809–1898), described the first principle of his foreign policy: Good government at home. Nepal must discard its obsession with the paranoid “yam between boulders” formulation and aim to be a confident pipal tree growing out of the crevices of the mighty rocks. \nThe day I met Rima (name changed), it was already late morning and she was anxious. There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rima’s body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rima’s house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rima’s quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepal’s decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepal’s conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepal’s history.Devi Khadka’s story had haunted me for years. I’d read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known ‘feminist’ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, it’s easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, “I’ve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.” Yet, some from Nepal’s transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her “political” and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. I’ve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, she’s been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepal’s transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as well—a way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepal’s transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepal’s wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal player—not a victim any more, but a leader—will strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist. Her film ‘Devi’ is screening at the DocEdge Festival in New Zealand in June. \n“Microfinance is not simply banking, it is a development tool”, defined the World Bank 25 years ago. Microfinance activities involve small loans, informal appraisal of borrowers and investment collateral substitutes with group guarantees or compulsory savings, micro-savings and, sometimes, micro-insurance services generally to the populace unbanked by the so-called mainstream financial services and commercial banking.There was an era when the microfinance model of development finance was hailed as a panacea to almost every socioeconomic problem. It was portrayed as a tool to reduce poverty, increase financial access and inclusion, provide formal financial services to the unbanked population, promote gender equality and empower women, support income generation and self-employment schemes, proliferate small and micro enterprises and so on. The United Nations designated 2005 as the International Year of Microcredit. The “Grameen” model of rural finance pioneered in the early 1980s by Bangladeshi economist (and later Nobel Laurette) Mohammad Yunus was replicated in about a hundred developing and a few developed countries. Ironic, though, that he received a Nobel Peace Prize (2006), not in economics.But by now, all the hoopla has sublimated, and microfinance as a development finance instrument is, in totality, considered a failed model. A study by the University of California, Berkley, concludes, “Microfinance is not the cure-all for worldwide poverty that international organizations, financial institutions, and countries have claimed it to be. Microfinance is not designed to end the cycle of poverty”. Rather, microfinancing, with the high cost of borrowing, further perpetuates poverty. “Many microloan and credit recipients are not likely to be able to pay off the loan in a timely manner, so they find themselves in an even worse place when their interest accumulates.” A report with a few different findings has also been published in the Stanford Social Innovation Review.Promoting businesses has also proved to be a big farce globally. In some countries, such as South Africa, 94 percent of micro-borrowers were found using the funds for social and family functions. Simply, these microcredit clients are neither likely to have the “next big idea” to expand their businesses nor are they likely to find larger investors to upscale their business operations substantially.Often exaggerated benefits, mostly non-economical ones, of microfinance have always shadowed the exorbitantly higher interest rates thrust upon poor borrowers. In some countries like Mexico, the total cost of funds is calculated up to 200 percent; in countries like Cambodia and Nepal, it ranges between 20 to 30 percent. Apparently, the rate of return on investment must at least be 100 percent for a borrower to pay the interest, sustain the business and support the family as a self-employed individual, which is beyond economic logic. Case in point: NepalNepal started the microfinance nature of development financing nearly six decades ago, in 1967, with the establishment of the Agricultural Department Bank. Its aim was to help finance the farmers to modernise their farming practices and commercialise agricultural products. Several other experiments followed, like the Small Farmer Development Scheme in the 1970s, to replicate the Grameen model by establishing five rural development banks in each of the then-five development regions in the early 1990s. These banks were promoted by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank of Nepal, with its direct investment. With the advent of the liberal economic era, several private investors and financial non-governmental organisations (FINGOs) entered the market. The Rural Banks were later privatised.By 2017, the number of central bank-regulated institutions providing microcredits, including microfinance institutions (MFIs), FINGOs and saving and credit cooperatives (before mushrooming) reached 103. At present, according to NRB data, there are 55 microfinance institutions with 6 million members and 2.66 million borrowers with a portfolio of Rs400 billion.The evolution and now looming crisis in Nepal's microfinance industry are not different from the general global scenario. Initially, MFIs were portrayed as tools to increase formal financial access to the unbanked, poor and marginalised population. They were also expected to increase the farm productivity of small farmers, promote micro-enterprises, and, of course, reduce poverty and help accelerate economic growth.These tall tasks were never achieved. There has not been any systematic and comprehensive research on actual benevolent outcomes of microfinance activities on poverty reduction, enterprise development, etc. But lately, the over-indebted “victims” of the MFIs are continuously protesting against exploitation and coercion to pauperise them.The findings of a study by the NRB only reinforced the general belief that MFIs have failed to achieve any articulated objectives except expanding some level of banking literacy in the rural hinterland. Nearly 30 percent of the borrowers’ ticket sizes were less than Rs50,000. Any actual economic activity can hardly be expected of them. Only 18 percent of the deceitful borrowers syphoned 38 percent of disbursed loans by indulging in multiple banking and perceivably circumventing the weak regulatory framework.A long series of misguided policies and authorities' unwillingness to correct them have only aggravated the problem. First, the actual cost of borrowing was never brought into policy discussion. Until the previous year, when the NRB put a 16.5-percent cap, it was often reported that the cost of borrowing from MFIs frequently crossed a 30 percent mark. Resource mobilisation methods of these MFIs as the second-tier intermediaries—borrowing from commercial banks and lending to customers—were essentially faulty. Perhaps the biggest mistake on the part of regulators is to allow these MFIs to list in the stock market, the scribes of which have become soft spots for market manipulators and insider traders. Due to this, despite the poor financial performance of many of these institutions, their share price is constantly on the rise. The stock market index is thus becoming increasingly spurious.Worst of all, even after all the anomalies and shortcomings have come to the fore, the government and regulatory authorities are unwilling to take decisive corrective actions. As the following monetary policy is just around the corner, the monetary authority must gather the courage to salvage the financial system from the menace of microfinance, which has only proven to be a burden to the economy. The only excuse given is that the size of the people involved is not enough to allow a massive market distortion in banking as well as the capital markets. \nCorruption cases against elected officials and bureaucrats have proliferated at the local level, hampering local unit functions and raising concerns about the lack of good governance and transparency in local governments.\nNepali leaders cultivate ties with China to boost their nationalist credentials, but China and Nepal's relations have faced issues, including stalled BRI cooperation and communication gaps.\nNepal spends billions on foreign education for its youth, contributing to remittance growth but losing human capital as young people leave the country for better opportunities.\nThe Nepali government plans to mandate the National ID Card for public services, facing criticism due to lack of widespread distribution, but the ID card aims to replace multiple cards and enhance security through biometric data and a central database, with measures in place to ensure data privacy.\nThe federal system in Nepal, adopted in 2015, faces criticism for its failure to deliver, with ongoing issues in provincial governance, central governance, and a lack of commitment to federalism among political leaders and parties.\nA parliamentary committee formed to investigate a cooperative scam faced challenges defining its jurisdiction due to political pressure, but eventually reached an agreement to probe Deputy Prime Minister Rabi Lamichhane's alleged involvement based on evidence and documents.\nAmnesty International's Secretary General expressed concerns over global human rights backsliding, including civic space shrinkage, digital law overreach, excessive use of force, and impunity in Nepal.\nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) is preparing for its first general convention, seeking to establish clear policies and leadership amid challenges in electoral performance and service delivery.\nPartly cloudy weather with light rainfall expected in eastern provinces; heavy rain forecast in Koshi Province; daily temperature variations recorded across Nepal.\nCloudy weather with scattered light rain and thunderstorms expected in parts of Nepal, including Koshi, Gandaki, Lumbini, Bagmati, and Madhesh provinces; maximum temperature in Nepalgunj reaches 43.8°C.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather with light rain, thunder, and gusty winds predicted in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces on Monday, with similar conditions expected in one or two places elsewhere in the country.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe process of enacting a separate air carriers’ liability and insurance legislation for domestic carriers has stalled yet again.On March 1, the Cabinet approved the tourism ministry’s proposal to prepare a draft bill on domestic air carriers’ liability and insurance.This was done years after Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999, which makes international airlines liable in case of death or injury to passengers. Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepal’s 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepal’s domestic airlines—nine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicopters—flew 4.15 million passengers in 2023. \nThe southwest monsoon entered Nepal on June 10, three days earlier than usual. However, despite this early arrival, the monsoon has not advanced beyond a few districts of the Koshi Province even after nine days.“Generally, it takes two days for the monsoon to reach the Kathmandu Valley after entering eastern Nepal,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecasting Division. “This year, we have not yet issued a second release about the monsoon progress.”Met officials and locals from Western Nepal, especially those in the Tarai districts, hoped for relief from the scorching heat. They expected that monsoon rains would arrive within days after entering the eastern part of the country. However, the monsoon clouds did not advance from the Koshi Province until Wednesday evening, leaving people struggling with the scorching heat. Maximum temperatures in several districts of western Nepal have remained over 40 degrees Celsius for the last several weeks, making daily life difficult, especially for the poor people who have to work outdoors during daytime to make ends meet.Badly affected by the heatwave, several schools in the districts have extended their leave. On Wednesday, Dhangadhi recorded 42.3 degree Celsius, followed by Nepalgunj 41.5, Birendranagar 40.1, Dipayal 40.2 degree Celsius. Kathmandu recorded 30.6 degree Celsius, according to the met office.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year southwest monsoon entered Nepal on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than the normal onset day. A normal monsoon, supported by the timely arrival of rain, translates into favourable agricultural production, mainly of paddy, and is further linked with the country’s overall economic growth.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts for 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.According to Manandhar, the easterly wind that brought monsoon rainfall in eastern Nepal is not strong enough to displace the westerly winds. Some places in Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces have been witnessing rainfall for the last couple of days, but this is caused by the local system, western disturbances, and low-pressure areas developed in Bihar, India.“We will issue the next bulletin in a couple of days to inform the public about the monsoon’s progress,” said Manandhar. “As the weather is unpredictable, so is the monsoon rainfall.”Met officials said that the early onset of the monsoon rain doesn't ensure early progress across the country.Last year it took three weeks for the monsoon to spread all over the country. “Sometimes, it spreads within two days,” said Manandhar.The Met Office has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events, such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.The department’s climate section has issued a weather forecast for four months, from June to September. It said most parts of the country are likely to experience above-average minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall due to weakened El Nino conditions and the development of La Nina conditions.El Nino refers to climatic patterns where ocean surface temperatures warm unusually. La Nina is the opposite where the ocean surface cools off.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by the monsoon this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly impacted, and 18,000 families will require rescue due to monsoon-related disasters. \nNepal and China held a meeting of the Joint Expert Group in Beijing on Wednesday.Prakash Joshi, the director general of the Department of Survey, led the Nepali delegation. Although the meeting concluded on Wednesday, both sides have yet to share the details.A Nepali participant from Beijing said although the meeting concluded on Wednesday, some formalities will be completed on Thursday. “We will only be able to share more details on Thursday,” he said.The meeting took place after almost 18 years of hiatus, just ahead of the Nepal-China foreign secretary-level talks slated for June 25. Representatives from ministries including foreign affairs, home affairs, defence, land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation, as well as the Nepali Embassy in Beijing participated in the meeting.The last meeting of the Joint Expert Group was held in 2006 in Kathmandu. The mechanism mandates a joint inspection of the Nepal-China border, dispute resolution, and finalisation of the fourth protocol to be signed by the two sides. The third Nepal-China boundary protocol was signed in 1988.The official said concerns from both sides were discussed in the meeting, and a positive outcome is expected. In the meeting, both sides discussed the status of the Nepal-China boundary, the date for commencing a joint boundary inspection, disputes in the Nepal-China border, and the signing of the Border Management System, whose initial agreement was signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit in 2019.The Chinese side has sent a copy of the border management agreement, which is now under the review of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, according to a joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.According to a senior official familiar with the matter, although the text of the Boundary Management System is yet to be released, it envisions forming two panels—a joint commission on boundary matters between Nepal and China, and a committee of boundary representatives to be led by competent authorities from the two countries.Nepal is yet to ratify the boundary management system.The joint secretary said the meeting will also discuss outstanding issues, such as the timing and form of inspection, and whether it should start anew or resume from where it was left in 2006.Nepal and China concluded their first boundary talks in 1961 and signed the Boundary Protocol in 1963.The 1963 Joint Boundary Protocol provides for three different mechanisms to deal with boundary issues: the Joint Inspection Team, Joint Expert Group, and Joint Inspection Committee. The mechanisms were enshrined in the Nepal-China Boundary Protocol signed between the two countries on January 20, 1963. Later, Nepal and China renewed the Boundary Protocol in 1979 and 1988.While the Joint Expert Group is led by the director general of the Department of Survey from the Nepali side and their Chinese counterpart, the Joint Inspection Committee is led by the deputy director general or under secretary from the Department of Survey and their Chinese counterpart, as per the practice and provisions. Similarly, the joint inspection committee is led by the joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.As per the boundary protocol, Nepal and China should conduct a joint boundary inspection every ten years.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on July 15, 2022, that officials from Nepal and China held a virtual talk in which they decided to activate the existing boundary mechanisms through mutual consultation.According to officials and experts, Nepal and China have a dispute over pillar number 57 in Dolakha district, which was a major bone of contention following the resolution of the height of Mt Everest in December 2020. Besides pillar no 57, disputes have often surfaced in Humla, Gorkha, and Kimathanka (Sankhuwasabha), which need to be resolved through joint inspection. In addition to resolving disputes, as per the boundary protocol, both sides should update the boundary status every 10 years.Despite the Nepal government’s claims that the Nepal-China border is largely free from disputes, there are reports of several boundary-related issues, such as encroachment, fencing and wiring, illegal construction, missing border pillars, lack of maintenance of boundary markers, and the Chinese side's use of high-level digital surveillance on the border. Nepali security agencies deployed on the border reported these issues to the Ministry of Home Affairs. \nAt least two police personnel have been found dead during duty hours within a week. The back-to-back apparent suicides in the Nepal Police organisation have raised concerns about mental health and the need for psychological training to ensure that officers are mentally as well as physically fit.A police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu, on Wednesday morning. Ajit Gole, 22, of Dolakha was found dead in a toilet of the parliament compound. After a preliminary investigation, police suspected that he shot himself.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6 am to 10 am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. According to a police source, Gole was engaged to a girl five months ago. The girl went to Dubai with Gole's monetary and other support. However, after reaching Dubai, she reportedly stopped contacting him. “Our primary finding is that Gole’s death is related to family issues,” Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police, told the Post.However, Karki refused to blame Gole’s death solely on his relationship with the girl. “It would be too early to reach a conclusion.” Lawmaker Menaka Kumari Pokharel of the ruling CPN-UML raised the issue of mental well-being in the police force at a meeting of the House of Representatives hours after the incident. She emphasised the need for psychological counselling in addition to other training for the security personnel. Speaking in the zero hours of the House meeting, lawmaker Pokharel said that as the army and police personnel are becoming the victims of mental stress, psychological counselling should be made a part of the official training. “Today, another incident occurred on these premises,” lawmaker Pokharel said. Though the issue of mental state of duty personnel has drawn public concern, a senior official at the police hospital said no serious problems are observed among Nepal Police personnel.“We barely see any member visiting the hospital seeking treatment for mental issues,” the senior police official told the Post, requesting anonymity. “Our society holds social taboos about mental health, and these are also reflected in police officers.” On June 13, another policewoman, Karishma Sunuwar, 25, was found dead by hanging in the bathroom of the Women, Children and Elderly Citizens Service Centre of the district police office, Siraha. Meanwhile, police on Tuesday arrested 27-year-old Pushkar Thapa Magar, a police constable from Banke working in Humla, on the charge of suicide abetment in the case of Karishma Sunwar. In Sunuwar and Gole's cases, a common factor was relationship. When both police officers could not handle the psychological pressure from their troubled relationships, they seem to have decided to take their own life, says a former police officer, asking not to be named.Both are psychological issues, which need to be addressed in time, the former police officer told the Post.Police spokesperson Karki said the increasing number of suicides among police personnel may be rooted in their psychological problems, among other factors.But there is no gauge to measure someone’s psychological problem. The only way to know if someone is a victim of psychological distress is through communication by family members or friends about their problems. “But in the cases of two police officers who committed suicide, we were not aware of their psychological issues,” Karki added.Karki said they also ease police officers' duties if they know their problems. “For example, we do not make them work long hours, nor do we assign them duties involving weapons.” \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Thursday defended the government’s recent decision to recall Nepal’s ambassadors from several countries.Speaking at the meeting of the House of Representatives, Dahal said that the envoys were recalled as per the constitution adding that the government was making efforts to adopt the policy to evaluate ambassadors as per objective, in order to strengthen the country’s diplomatic relations.“The government is committed to mobilising diplomatic missions and envoys in the best interest of the nation,” he said. “As per the Ambassador Appointment Directive, 2015, the envoys can be recalled before the completion of their terms if deemed necessary.”Only those who have been appointed as ambassadors under political quota are recalled immediately after the change in the coalition, the prime minister added, “instead this time around, the envoys remained in their posts for more than three months after the change in the ruling coalition.” Dahal said that this was proof of how the government was serious about the issue.Government picks some ambassadors under political quota based on recommendations from coalition partners while it selects some career diplomats from within the ministry of foreign affairs for other countries.Talking about his recent India visit, Prime Minister Dahal also said that discussion regarding the effective implementation of the agreements reached between the two South Asian neighbours was held.During a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, strengthening Nepal-India relations, implementation of past agreements, and bilateral discussions—including border disputes, among other matters were discussed, according to him.“Serious discussion about the implementation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, Arun Hydropower Project and cooperation in the agricultural sector was held,” Dahal said.Dahal visited New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi on June 9. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel’s recent visit to Switzerland and Germany emphasised the need for the international community to focus on the priorities of underdeveloped mountainous countries like Nepal regarding climate change, the Office of the President said.Kiran Pokharel, press advisor to the President, said that a number of events during Paudel’s visit drew international attention to the impacts of climate change in countries like Nepal—particularly the President’s address at the inaugural forum of the Global Coalition for Social Justice of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, his meetings with German scientists, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier’s concern about climate change during their bilateral discussion.During his visit to various climate research centres in Germany, Paudel had praised the Germans’ research on the issue and suggested that they focus on measures to minimise the effects of climate change, Pokharel added.The President, who had embarked on a weeklong visit to Switzerland and Germany on June 11, returned home on June 19. During his stay, President Paudel held meetings with his Swiss and German counterparts on June 13 and 17, respectively, and discussed issues of bilateral interest.Paudel had also requested the researchers to make the international community aware of what needed to be done to minimise emissions from carbon-emitting countries.“Your research relating to climate change so far has been praiseworthy,” Pokharel quoted the President as saying. “But I believe your research should now focus on how to protect ourselves from the varied effects of climate change. Similarly, you must also suggest to the international community what needs to be done by the carbon-emitting nations to minimise emissions and also by smaller nations affected by it.”German President Steinmeier had expressed his gratitude for Paudel’s suggestions to the scientists during their bilateral meeting and had extended the European nation’s sympathy for a mountainous country like Nepal.Steinmeier also added that Germany was ready to provide Nepal with whatever aid it required.President Paudel had expressed his hopes for Germany’s investment in agriculture, water resource management, and tourism development of Nepal.He also requested Germany to facilitate the release and repatriation of six Nepalis who have been kept in Ukrainian military custody. Germany, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), has been providing military assistance to Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine war.In his speech at the inaugural forum of the Global Coalition for Social Justice of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, President Paudel stressed the need to shift the international community’s focus to climate change.“While discussing social justice, we should not forget climate justice, which should be established as a global issue,” Paudel said. “The international community, especially large carbon emitters, should not deviate from their responsibility.”Climate justice must be immediately ensured to the carbon-negative countries that are vulnerable to the varied effects of climate change by providing adequate funding and necessary technological assistance, Paudel added.Paudel said that Nepal has had to face the brunt of climate change even if it has only a negligible contribution to the warming climate. Mountains, including Mount Everest, have been turning into blocks of rocks due to rising temperatures and the depletion of glaciers at an unprecedented rate, Paudel said.“Climate change has seriously affected clean water, crops, biodiversity and health, pushing millions of our people into extreme poverty and inequality,” he said. “The displacement of families, communities and loss of livelihood due to climate change disasters has made the problem even more complex.” \nAvant-garde, mysterious, and maximalist, Gopal Kalapremi Shrestha’s residential studio in Baluwatar has a personality of its own. Dimly lit, the stairway is adorned with esoteric, vivid and diverse artwork collected over the years. Gas cylinders line up on the floor like ants, powering the kiln for his ceramics.The walls of his studio are filled with stacks of paint boxes, and the floor is scattered with eccentric statues whose forms range from the whimsically abstract to the hauntingly realistic. In-progress artworks are stacked on shelves, and tools hang on the walls and cover the floor, blurring the line between utilitarian and aesthetic. In the living room, a cabinet contains artworks by his family members, including Shrestha’s wife and youngest son, who is teaching fine art abroad. Passing another flight of stairs, he shows me a rare ceramic method from China and miniatures made by his wife. The top floor houses a kitchen, with a dining table adorned with huge vases featuring painted anthropomorphic figures—part of his ongoing collection, ‘Eclipse’. A shelf displays brightly glazed cups of various colours, and adjacent to this is a door to the terrace, where the family dog greets me with jovial barks. The terrace maintains the same eccentric personality as the rest of the house—with pots and statues of varying sizes, shapes, and stories. Here, Shrestha shares his profound connection with crows and explains his fascination with the bird, whose imagery he frequently incorporates into his artwork.  Perhaps, touring his house before sitting down for a formal interview was an offering of an alternate kind of understanding—a prelude before I began to bore him with the quintessential questions of reportage.You can tell a lot about a person by the objects they collect—or the ones they don’t. In Shrestha’s sanctuary of artistic clutter, you begin to understand him through the stories woven into each object. He shares these tales in a delightfully non-linear fashion, expecting you to piece them together on your own.Shrestha is an artist who works in many mediums, though he is primarily known for his ceramics and sculptures. He also paints and writes poetry. According to him, the greatest pleasure in his career comes from mentoring young artists and imparting the knowledge he has gained.He takes inspiration from all kinds of conflicts to incorporate into his artwork, both intrinsic and extrinsic. He has created pieces inspired by the Maoist insurgency and the COVID pandemic. He is also deeply fascinated by the female form, which he incorporates into his works.In one of his art series, he features three sculptures of female goddesses linked to the well-known Sanskrit chant “Ya devi sarvabhuteshu,” which dictates that a woman can be both creator and destroyer. Shrestha says that he has great respect for mothers and derives great inspiration from them.Autodidactic, with a penchant for learning the abstract, Shrestha is deeply curious and possesses remarkable inquisitiveness. He is mostly self-taught, “My curiosity made me an artist. As an eager individual, I would board a random bus from Ratnapark with no destination in mind. Wherever I would end up, I would paint the landscape,” he says.Perhaps this curiosity led him to foreign lands, where he began to understand different types of art forms. Initially fascinated by terracotta statues, he learned the chemistry behind the glazing technique from a French artist during a residency in India—a method he then incorporated into his own work.Additionally, he collects a diverse range of artworks during his extensive travels, turning his home into a museum of sorts.\"I have a deep disdain for people who fetishise the suffering of artists; artists can make good art without suffering,\" says Shrestha, while also acknowledging that much of his work is driven by deep emotional turmoil. His recent ongoing work, ‘The Eclipse’, represents a time of distress due to various circumstances.“An artist harbours deep curiosity, someone who pays close attention to all that is around him,” says Shrestha as he recounts his childhood. Even though he grew up in poverty, he fondly looks back at his early years. At this point in life, he finds himself deeply nostalgic for his childhood days, so much so that he is planning to write a book on nostalgia. “I want this book to be a remembrance of the time I am from,” he says. Shrestha is a prodigal talker. He is informed, ardent, informal, and relaxed. He habitually quotes individuals such as Gautam Buddha, Vincent Van Gogh’s sister-in-law, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Chinese artist Ai Weiwei—drawing from a reservoir of arcane wisdom and recondite insights.His recollections are vivid, descriptive, yet fragmented and emotional. He has a deep gratitude for his friends who helped him make the ceramics field more popular in Nepal. He recounts meeting Ian Martin, whom he befriended on a single day in 2006 when he was visiting Nepal for peace talks amid the Maoist insurgency.When he befriended Martin, he was unaware that Martin was a UN official and conversed with him too casually—with multiple pats on the back as well. The following day, he saw Martin in the newspaper and was befuddled and a little embarrassed to have treated a dignitary so informally.He called Martin again, and they stayed in touch in the years that followed. Shrestha says that Martin also brought him boxes filled with books on ceramics as a present, something he is deeply grateful for.Deep into the conversation, he breaks the interview’s fourth wall with piercing honesty, “When you interview me, your worldview and biases are inevitably reflected. In writing about me, you inevitably write about yourself,” he asserts, something with which I vehemently agree.“The world, nature, and our energies are deeply connected,” muses Shrestha, who identifies as deeply spiritual rather than religious. He feels it is essential to distinguish between the two. “I believe in energies,” he says.His art exhibitions, like ‘Heroes’, featured 108 sculptures. In ‘Where the Wild Things Are’, Shrestha uses ceramic art to explore the impact of the pandemic and value the power of women.In his series of artistic chess pieces called ‘Tharu’, inspired by tribal motifs, he is influenced and inspired by the socio-cultural changes in Nepal.His extensive body of work spans various genres and periods, for which Shrestha has received numerous accolades, including awards from the Royal Nepal Academy (1983), the National Art Competition for Contemporary Sculpture by NAFA (1985, 1986), the National Art Competition for Contemporary Ceramic Sculpture by NAFA (1996), and the Creative Artist Man of the Year award presented by the Nepal Art Society (2005), among others.But in his quiet house, brimming with students he mentors on sculpture and ceramics, Shrestha finds himself detached from it all. Amid the comforting familiarity of his surroundings, he self-reflects, internalises, and eventually attempts to understand himself and the world around him.Amidst sentimental objects and books fervently memorised, Gopal is simply kalapremi, a faithful lover of arts. \nPrime Minister Dahal announces refund of Rs772.44 million to victims of cooperative scams, initiates efforts to establish a dedicated regulatory body, and acknowledges the contributions of law-abiding cooperatives.\nNepal's cricket team made its mark at the T20 World Cup, despite not winning any matches, and raised hopes for future success with strong performances against top teams.\nSri Lanka's upcoming presidential election renews debates on the implementation of the 13th Amendment, a measure aimed at resolving Tamil insurgency through devolution of power to Provincial Councils, with the UNP, TNA, and President Wickremesinghe supporting its full implementation, while the Rajapakses and ultra-nationalists remain opposed.\nIn 2023, the EU saw a 20% increase in first-time asylum applications (1,048,900), primarily from Syria, Afghanistan, Turkey, Venezuela, and Colombia, amid ongoing concerns about the adequacy of the EU's Migration and Asylum Pact and its potential impact on protection seekers.\nNepal faces challenges in promoting electric vehicles due to a lack of clear policies, a tax hike, and insufficient charging infrastructure, despite its commitment to EV-based mobility by 2030.\nA man drowned in a flooded river, and floods displaced three families in Jhapa district, Nepal.\nIsraeli tanks backed by warplanes and drones advanced deeper into the western part of the Gaza Strip city of Rafah on Wednesday, killing eight people, according to residents and Palestinian medics.Residents said the tanks moved into five neighbourhoods after midnight. Heavy shelling and gunfire hit the tents of displaced families in the Al-Mawasi area, further to the west of the coastal enclave, they said.Some eight months into the war, there has been no sign of let up in the fighting as efforts by international mediators, backed by the United States, have failed to persuade Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire.Twelve Palestinians were also killed in an Israeli strike that hit a group of citizens and merchants in the south of the Gaza Strip, medical sources told Reuters on Wednesday.The people were hit as they waited for convoys of aid trucks carrying goods through the Kerem Shalom crossing in Salahuddin Road northeast of Rafah, the sources added.Israeli forces have laid waste to much of Gaza and seized most of the Palestinian territory but have yet to achieve Israel’s stated goal of wiping out Hamas and freeing Israeli hostages.Medics and Hamas media said eight Palestinians were killed in Al-Mawasi and many families fled north in panic. They did not identify the fatalities, and the Israeli military said it was looking into the report.Residents said Israeli army forces blew up several homes in western Rafah, which had sheltered over half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people before last month, when Israel began its ground offensive and forced most of the population to head northwards.Some United Nations and Palestinian figures put those who remained at under 100,000 people.“Another night of horror in Rafah. They opened fire from planes, drones and tanks on the western areas to cover for their invasion,” said one Rafah resident, who asked not to be named.“Bullets and shells landed in the Mawasi area near where people slept, killing and wounding many,” he told Reuters via a chat app.An Israeli commander briefing military correspondents in Rafah on Tuesday named two more locations there - Shaboura and Tel Al-Sultan - where the army planned to take on Hamas fighters.“The Hamas battalions there are not yet well worn down and we need to dismantle them completely. We estimate it at more or less a month, at this intensity,” Colonel Liron Batito, head of the Givati Brigade, told Army Radio.The Israeli military remained in control of the border between Rafah and Egypt. Footage circulated on social media showed the Rafah crossing, the only window for most of Gaza’s population with the outside world, was destroyed, buildings burnt, and Israeli tanks positioned there with the flag of Israel flying over some places.The Israeli military said aid into Gaza had not been impeded by the damage.Further north, Israel sent a column of tanks back into the Zeitoun neighbourhood in Gaza City, and residents reported heavy fire from tanks and warplanes but also sounds of gun battles with Hamas-led fighters.In another Gaza City suburb, Sheikh Radwan, an Israeli air strike on a house killed four Palestinians, including a child, medics said. A total of 20 people were killed across Gaza.The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said fighters battled Israeli forces with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs, and have in some areas detonated pre-planted explosive devices against army units.Later on Wednesday, Palestinian gunmen fired rockets at the Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Gaza, the Israeli military said.Israel’s ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left much of the population homeless and destitute.Since a week-long truce in November, repeated attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refuses to end the war before Hamas is eradicated and the hostages are freed.On Wednesday, the United Nations human rights office said Israeli forces may have repeatedly violated fundamental principles of the laws of war and failed to distinguish between civilians and fighters in their Gaza campaign.In a report assessing six Israeli attacks that caused a high number of casualties and destruction of civilian infrastructure, the UN Human Rights Office said Israeli forces “may have systematically violated the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions in attack”.Israel’s permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva called the analysis “factually, legally, and methodologically flawed”. \nThe weather today will be generally cloudy in Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province, and Gandaki Province. The rest of the country will experience partly cloudy to mainly fair conditions.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, there are chances of light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning in some places in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces. A few areas in Madhesh and Sudurpaschim provinces, along with one or two places in the rest of the country, may also experience similar weather. Heavy rain is likely to occur in one or two locations in Koshi Province, as stated in the weather bulletin for Thursday.Tonight, the skies will remain partly to generally cloudy in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, while the rest of the country will have partly cloudy conditions. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is expected in some places in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces. A few areas in Madhesh and one or two places in the rest of the country may also see similar weather. Heavy rainfall is likely to occur in one or two places in Koshi Province.Stay updated with the latest weather reports and take necessary precautions, especially in areas prone to heavy rainfall.On Wednesday, Dhangadi recorded a scorching maximum temperature of 42.3 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature in Jomsom was a cool 16 degrees Celsius. \nDiarrhoeal cases have declined threefold in Nepal, multiple reports, including a recent one by the Nepal Statistics Office, show. The Nepal Demographic Health Survey-2022 and a report of the Ministry of Health and Population suggest the same.Improvements in water and sanitation conditions, personal hygiene and awareness levels are credited with the decline in infection from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoeal infections.“A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices,” reads a report by the Nepal Statistics Office.Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health concern usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. It is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, also showed that 10 percent of children under 5 have diarrhoea. The prevalence of diarrhoea is highest among children aged 6-11 months at 18 percent, followed by 13 percent each among those aged 12–23 months and less than six months.Public health experts say the decline in open defecation, the general public’s behavioural change towards hygienic practice, and an increase in literacy and education levels could have also contributed to a decline in diarrhoeal infections.“Decline in open defecation, rise in education and awareness levels, behavioural changes, improvement in water and sanitation conditions play an important role in cutting the burden of diarrhoeal infections,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “We can see a lot of changes in these things, but at the same time, we should not forget that sources of drinking water are still problematic in many places, including in the capital city.”According to the NDHS report, advice or treatment was sought for 57 percent of children who had diarrhoea in the two weeks preceding the survey, down from 64 percent in 2016.The report also shows that the percentage of diarrhoeal infection is lower among those with an unimproved source of drinking water at 4 percent than among those with an improved source at 11 percent.Experts say that so-called improved sources of drinking water are still not safe to drink.“E.coli and coliform-like hazardous microbes get detected in most water resources, including in the samples of bottled water,” Pun said. “We must be more cautious while drinking water, as the monsoon season has just started and most water sources get contaminated with floodwaters.”Earlier in March, drinking water samples collected from public taps and community schools in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur were found to be contaminated with faecal coliform.Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. Its presence means that the drinking water being used by locals of Godawari is contaminated with sewage.The Ministry of Health and Population’s annual report for the fiscal year 2022-23 also shows a three-fold decline in diarrhoeal infections. According to the report, the national incidence rate of diarrhoea was 115 per 1,000 under-five children in 2022-23 compared to 365 in the fiscal year 2021-22.The ministry’s report showed four under-five deaths from diarrhoeal infection in the fiscal year 2022-23 compared to 34 deaths in 2021-22.Of the four deaths that occurred in the fiscal year 2022-23, one each was recorded in Bagmati, Madhesh, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with no reported diarrhoeal death in Lumbini, Koshi, and Gandaki provinces.Contrary to the NDHS, the health ministry’s report shows that Karnali Province had the highest incidence of diarrhoea—216, followed by Lumbini Province’s 161. The lowest incidence was reported in Bagmati Province at 78.According to the World Health Organisation, diarrhoea is the second leading cause of mortality in children under five. The disease has also been linked with growth and cognitive shortfalls in children, especially in marginalised communities.Doctors say the only ways to prevent people from dying of water-borne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the country’s transitional justice process paralysed, a Nepali conflict victim has taken to the United Nations forum to remind the Nepal government of its responsibilities towards the victims.Speaking before the UN Security Council in New York on Wednesday, Ram Kumar Bhandari, whose father was forcibly disappeared by the state security forces in 2001, said that the state has the responsibility to search for answers and provide closure to the victims, but it has not done enough. Nepal endured a violent Maoist insurgency from 1996, which ended after ten years with a comprehensive peace accord in 2006.Bhandari addressed the council as a representative of the Global Alliance of the Missing, advocating for families of missing and disappeared people across the world.“The world has not done enough to acknowledge the suffering of the families or to address their needs,” he said. “Families in Nepal are still waiting for answers 18 years after the end of the conflict.” This is the second time that an insurgency victim was allowed to speak before the UN Security Council, considered one of the most influential UN bodies. He said the families would like to remind states that they seek their continued support in mobilising the relevant authorities to find the “political will” and the needed resources so that families can find truth, answers, and justice. There is no sustainable peace without individual peace, he asserted. “We, families of missing people, would like to encourage states to adopt missing persons legislation and appropriate legal frameworks in all countries where missing persons are present,” he further said. Talking to the Post over the phone from New York, he said that addressing the UN Security Council was a great opportunity to remind the leadership from different countries, including Nepal, about the situation of conflict victims and these states’ obligation towards them. “Imagine surviving the horrors of a war, only for your father, mother, siblings or children to go missing. What happens to those who remain when a family member is lost, not to death or relocation but to an enforced disappearance or having gone missing? How do the people left behind cope with that tragedy and move on,” he said.Bhandari’s father, Tej Bahadur, a former teacher, was arrested from Besisahar, headquarters of Lamjung district, on December 31, 2001, during the state of emergency. He was detained by a joint team of security forces commanded by then Deputy Superintendent of Police Pitambar Adhikari, according to the complaint filed at the disappearance commission. Tej Bahadur was blindfolded, handcuffed, and tortured in the street before being taken into custody, and was never seen again. Like Bhandari, thousands of families of the victims of enforced disappearances and other human rights violations have continuously been fighting for justice for around two decades, but successive governments and political parties have paid little attention to justice delivery. Records at the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons show as many as 3,223 complaints of enforced disappearances implicating either security forces or the Maoists have been lodged at the commission. The commission has identified 2,494 cases falling under its jurisdiction for investigation. Similarly, 63,718 complaints have been registered with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Human rights defenders say a conflict victim demanding justice from the UN Security Council is a significant step. “Bhandari’s address will definitely build pressure to move the transitional justice process forward. His statement has been officially recorded,” Mohna Ansari, a former member of the National Human Rights Commission, told the Post. “It might not have immediate results, but Nepal might face questions at the UN forums like the Universal Periodic Review.”Nepal’s transitional justice process has been paralysed since July 2022, when the government decided to extend the terms of two commissions without retaining their chairpersons and members. Despite the government’s claim that the amendment bill to the Transitional Justice Act would be endorsed by October 2022, which would also open the door for recruiting new office bearers, there has been no progress in amending the Act.The major political parties, despite making several attempts, have been unable to find a meeting point on the bill though there has been some progress.After year-long discussions, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives has narrowed down the differences in the bill. However, the House panel had been struggling to decide whether to categorise arbitrary killings or all killings except those that occurred in clashes as serious violations of human rights. It had also been unable to decide what happens in case the victims of human rights violations refuse to reconcile and demand punishment for the perpetrators. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal administration, through the national budget presented on May 28, has decided to set up a one-billion-rupee peace fund to provide relief and compensation to the victims. The government also has also announced to expedite the transitional justice process in the upcoming fiscal year. However, the bill has not been discussed since the formation of the UML-Maoist coalition on March 4. It is not known when the parliamentary committee will start discussing the amendment bill. Om Prakash Mishra, former Supreme Court chief justice, leads the committee formed to recommend the names of the office bearers of two commissions, but without the Act being amended, it has not commenced its work.Also addressing the UN Security Council, Lok Bahadur Thapa, Nepal’s permanent resident to the UN, said the country is committed to delivering justice to the victims by adopting its own homegrown and nationally-led process. “We have two transitional commissions to investigate the complaints. Similarly, the parliament is working on the amendment to the transitional justice law as directed by the Supreme Court,” he said. \nNepal is a de facto caste-apartheid state. A 2007 Human Rights Watch report on the “untouchables” of India observed, “The only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid in South Africa.” The HRW has declared caste discrimination a form of “hidden apartheid”—an apt observation for Nepal as well.In the past years, caste hatred and exclusion have become more concealed yet pervasive in the Himalayan region; caste has also spread its tentacles in the global diaspora. Last month, Amnesty International criticised the government’s utter apathy and lack of accountability on the persistent plight of Dalits. The communist-populist alliance in government doesn’t seem to heed the call for change. This is clear from recently announced government policies, programmes and budgets for the fiscal year 2024-25. The authorities are bent on keeping caste hierarchy and untouchability sacred and solid. Budget for ‘Dalit skills’On March 21, 2022, attending a Dalit function in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that he was making a big announcement for the dignity and freedom of the “untouchables”. So much so that, he said, they would not forget it in over a century. He hasn’t made his supposedly phenomenal Dalit project explicit, but some Dalits still haven’t given up their hopes. Something came with this year’s budget for the Dalit community: Rs200 million to enhance Dalits’ traditional skills to create employment and promote their livelihood. This small yet seemingly significant budget has buoyed some Dalits. After all, as everybody says, something is better than nothing. However, I’m sceptical about the effectiveness of the Dalit-centred budget. Is it a big enough pot of money to significantly impact the target population? Most people would say “No”. Even some prominent Dalit NGO personalities close to the governing parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount. Equally, are Dalits the only beneficiaries of this new scheme? I don't think so. The details of the intended 200-million project haven’t been developed yet. But it seems many non-Dalits will also get the support, especially those close to the ruling parties and leaders. There are at least two reasons for my understanding. First is the very name of the entity the government plans to establish to use that money: A separate body called the “Dalit, Neglected and Oppressed Class Upliftment and Development Corporation.” The use of so many words is likely intended to involve the beneficiaries from different castes and social groups. My suspicion stems from the second fact: In today’s Nepal, traditional Dalit skills—such as goldsmithing, tailoring, woodworking, and shoemaking—are no longer exclusively practised by Dalits. Once commercialised, many castes including the apex groups, have started these trades. So, skill enhancement projects will probably not be offered only to Dalits. I am not suggesting Dalits should have exclusive rights over these essential skills. It is neither practical nor proper to make such a case. My point is that it is probably wrong to think that the budget is for the betterment of Dalits. Untouched untouchabilityI have a serious objection to the utter lack of sensitivity towards the problems of Dalits, mainly the persistent practice of untouchability (hidden apartheid) in government policies, programmes and the budget. There is no single statement in the policies that mentions untouchability, let alone try to address it. The same applies to the state and local authorities under the federal system. The biggest irony is found in the Karnali Province, where the Province Head, Tilak Pariyar, is a Dalit man with a long history of fighting against the state as part of the Maoist movement, with ending caste oppression as a primary goal. On May 23, he presented 84-point policies and programmes of the province. Study it in detail, and aside from lip service here and there, there is no serious concern about the situation of Dalits in Karnali who have been facing caste humiliation and violence like nowhere else in the country. Yet the authorities seem totally blind to the realities! Recommended policy objectives What should a responsible government do, both in Kathmandu and Karnali? First, the federal capital should become sensitive towards the plight of Dalits, who suffer tremendously due to popular beliefs and practices of ritual impurity. Then, the federal capital should design a national policy framework that could be followed by the lower authorities.On a Sunday press meet, Caste Watch Network (CWN), a newly launched Dalit campaign group, recommended two fundamental policy objectives for tackling the complex problem of untouchability.First, the state should introduce new laws and policies—sticks and carrots—to enforce the constitutional and legal provisions against untouchability. It could, for example, forge a policy of immediately suspending government officials guilty of excluding and humiliating Dalits. Elderly people who discriminate against Dalits could be deprived of their elderly pensions for two years or so. Any temple practising Dalit exclusion could be deprived of state support in the form of money and sacred offerings and sacrificial animals (yes, even the historical and famous temples like Gorakhkali and Manakamana do practise a form of social exclusion). The second important policy objective would be to reform the religion. Some people frown at my suggestions about initiating religious and cultural reform, which they think takes many decades, if not centuries.While we cannot easily rewrite casteist texts like Manusmriti and Parasaramriti, it is possible to achieve the reformation of some religious beliefs and practices over time. For that, the secular state should stand firm against religious dogma and formulate proper laws and implement them. If no religious and/or cultural reform were possible at all, we would still be burning our mothers and sisters and other women alive on the sati pyres. If reform weren’t possible, we wouldn’t see a section of Bahuns drinking alcohol and consuming pork, and, as alluded to earlier, engaging in tailoring, drumming, shoemaking and goldsmithing. Upper castes have deceived Dalits. They have forced religious and cultural transformations in areas that benefit them materially and in other ways. And they have been opposed to the reform of those areas of religious and cultural traditions that would ensure equal rights for Dalits. For example, a Bahun doesn’t become polluted by drinking and drumming; these transgressions do not anger his deities. But he thinks he and his family, lineage and other deities and spirits become polluted if a drummer enters his house. Religious-cultural reform is not as tough as it seems. Governments and authorities at all levels should introduce new laws and policies and spend large sums to change the spiritual, religious and cultural spheres. Without this, we cannot do away with untouchability. \nThe caretaker Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is all set to take the oath of office for the third constitutive term on Sunday evening, with the invited South Asian leaders to witness the ceremony. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak. \nFollowing the Supreme Court's annulment of the Oli government's Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land swap, opposition parties have accused the CPN-UML of \"policy corruption,\" leading to defensive maneuvers from the UML and calls for an investigation.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n[Crucial Event Description] occurred, leading to [Consequence].\nThe Araniko Project, through Mandarin primary sources, explores Nepal-China relations, emphasizing language proficiency and historical understanding for comprehensive insights.\nProject Sambad, a platform for in-depth societal and policy-making discussions, held its first edition in Kathmandu on March 14-15.\nTop CPN (Unified Socialist) leaders are preparing for the general convention and lobbying for leadership positions, with former Prime Ministers Nepal and Khanal likely to face off for the party chief role, while consensus on leadership selection is emphasized.\nAmid growing speculations of rifts in the ruling parties, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Monday came to the defence of the government and his ruling partners.Recently, CPN-UML chair KP Oli, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha, who belongs to the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and others have expressed serious disagreements over the annual budget, and the government’s working style and performance. Oli criticised Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun’s budget as favouring “one man, one party”, expressing his concerns over low allocations for the UML-led ministries.On the other hand, speaking at a party function on Friday, Minister Shrestha of the RSP said they would quit the government if they had to make “unnecessary compromises”. “That is why our resignation letters are in our pockets,” he said. “As soon as we start feeling frustrated, we will put in our papers.”These two back-to-back statements by Oli and Shrestha sparked speculations about a growing rift between Oli, Dahal, and other ruling partners.But Prime Minister Dahal, talking to reporters at Bharatpur airport on Monday, said: “He pretended to criticise, he has not genuinely criticised.”“This government will continue until the end of its term. The rumours [about rifts] are unfounded,” said Dahal.The prime minister also subtly responded to the statement made by minister Shrestha, acknowledging that it is typical of the RSP’s stance, but reiterated that the government would complete its full term. “Carrying resignation letters in pocket is the identity of the RSP,” said Dahal. “But that does not mean they will withdraw support.” Dahal also ruled out the possibility of removing Nepal Police IGP Basanta Kunwar from his post. There were some media reports that Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane was trying to remove IGP Kuwar due to some differences. “Recently, I called a meeting of all three security chiefs—of the Nepal Police, the Armed Police Force and the National Investigation Department—and clearly told them to work with high morale. No one is going to remove any security chief,” the prime minister told reporters. “These are all rumours.” Sources close to the prime minister said that UML chairman Oli was also against an abrupt removal of the Nepal Police chief. As rumours about the police chief’s potential removal spread, Nepal Police headquarters issued a statement on Sunday refuting these claims, describing the media reports as baseless. One senior RSP leader told the Post that Minister Shrestha has serious differences with some office-bearers of the Nepal Sports Council and that Shrestha is unhappy with lack of cooperation from bureaucrats and officials. “Both Dahal and Oli understand the RSP’s strength and they don’t want to let us go,” the RSP leader said. “It’s just that some of our friends want to make public the difficulties they faced in the first 100 days in government.” According to Prime Minister Dahal, “Rabiji [Lamichhane] has always said that he leads a force that is different from other parties and if it cannot deliver, it will quit the government.” “So it is not surprising to hear the RSP leaders talk like that. But as far as I understand, the RSP is not quitting the government,” Dahal added. One UML central committee member said that as the leader of the largest coalition partner, Oli has some compulsions, which is why he made such statements. “Some Maoist leaders accused Oli of trying to micromanage the government, which is not true. Our party has given Prime Minister Dahal a free hand and will help him in every step,” the UML central committee member said. Janamat Party chief CK Raut told the Post that there are no substantive differences within the ruling parties and some comments the media have been citing are quite harmless. The prime minister has already asked Raut to join the government. “The government is not in crisis as some sections of the media are reporting. Some innocuous statements have been blown out of proportion,” said Raut, whose party is preparing to join the government after the budget’s parliamentary approval. At Oli’s suggestion, Raut was offered the post of foreign minister in a cabinet reshuffle, according to sources. But Raut remains undecided. “Nothing has been finalised,” said Raut. “As far as my joining the government is concerned, I am in favour of supporting the government from the outside. But some of our friends will join.”  \nShould non-governmental organisations be allowed in legislative committee deliberations? This age-old question has divided experts and legislators. While NGOs have long been active in Nepal’s lawmaking process, controversy flared anew when NGO representatives were found attending Sunday’s session of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament without the knowledge of many lawmakers. The committee was scheduled to discuss the federal civil code amendment bill with expert input from Umesh Mainali, the former chief of the Public Service Commission. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane was also present at the meeting. However, the meeting took an unexpected turn when lawmakers noticed an elaborate breakfast and lunch arrangement, a departure from usual tea and simple fare. This led to questions about the sponsorship.Upon noticing the breakfast arrangement in the committee hall, Nepali Congress lawmaker Hridaya Ram Thani approached the committee president for clarification. It was revealed that the breakfast was arranged by an NGO, whose representatives were present in the meeting hall, leading to an abrupt adjournment of the meeting without any agenda being discussed.“After knowing that the lunch was sponsored by an NGO, Home Minister Lamichhane left the meeting hall,” Thani told the Post. Before leaving, Lamichhane also questioned the committee chair stating that it was unacceptable to hold a meeting with the breakfast sponsored by an NGO, Thani said, quoting Lamichhane. The National Forum for Parliamentarians on Population and Development (NFPPD), an NGO, had sponsored the breakfast and lunch for lawmakers. Two representatives of the NGO, Ram Guragain and Arinika Rai, were present in the committee meeting hall. Amidst the disruption, committee members raised questions about the role of Ramhari Khatiwada, the Congress lawmaker who leads the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, concerning the NGO’s catering arrangements.But Khatiwada denied any involvement. “I was not aware of the presence of the NGO representatives in the meeting, or of the breakfast arrangement,” Khatiwada told the Post. “After we knew about it, we cancelled the meeting.” “Though other parliamentary committees might allow NGO representatives to attend meetings, our committee does not permit such things,” added Khatiwada. However, CPN-UML lawmaker Prithvi Subba Gurung dismissed the issue. “If necessary, people from various walks of life can be invited to the committee to discuss various agenda,” Gurung told the Post. “There was no reason for disruption.” Mainali, who was invited for his expert input to Sunday’s committee meeting, echoed Gurung and said various stakeholders can participate in committee discussions, but they are excluded when the committee engages in agenda-specific discussions. “In my understanding, the controversy arose not due to the participation of the NGO’s representatives, but because of the breakfast and lunch they arranged,” Mainali told the Post. However, the committee member and lawmaker of Congress, Ishwari Devi Neupane, has a different view. Neupane argues that the presence of NGO representatives could influence a forum dedicated to formulating state laws. “If we allow representatives of an NGO into committee meetings, other NGOs might seek similar permission, and this could impact the lawmaking process,” Neupane told the Post. “That is why we questioned the presence of the NGO that sponsored today’s breakfast and lunch.” Neupane stressed that while agendas can be openly discussed with the representatives of civil society and NGOs outside the committee hall, inviting them to committee meetings is a wrong practice. However, NFPPD representative Guragain, who was present at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee meeting, said his organisation directly deals with parliamentarians and is often invited to such meetings. “We participated in Sunday’s discussion because we have been taking part in discussions in other committees as well,” Guragain told the Post. “We had an invitation letter to the meeting from the parliamentary committee.”However, former minister Ramesh Nath Pandey says incorporating the agendas of INGOs and NGOs into the lawmaking process is wrong and such practice must end. Pandey said such influences were more visible during the constitution-drafting process. “External elements are present not only during the drafting of policy papers, but also in the workings of sensitive institutions and law drafting. As a result, our decision-making process is becoming ineffective,” Pandey said. “If lawmakers acknowledge and rectify their past mistakes, things would improve.”  \nWhat’s cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party? Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government?Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government.Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises.Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet.After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently.“We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post.Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam.“The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.”After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls.During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said.“However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.”Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K.The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television.“Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.”But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.” \nCPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli once again vented his ire at the budget for the new fiscal year on Saturday, fuelling speculations of growing discord among the ruling parties.On May 29, the day after Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun read out the national budget in Parliament, Oli lambasted some of the provisions and said the fiscal plan was of “one minister and one party”.Oli and his party were unhappy with some of the provisions, including the distribution of funds to the conflict victims, who mostly are CPN (Maoist Centre) members. Oli’s UML is the largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition government.Addressing the UML parliamentary party meeting on Saturday, Oli said the budget had failed to address the concerns of the poor. “Our duty is to stop poverty and lead the country towards development. If the poor are not benefitting and development is not happening, how can we satisfy them?” Oli wondered.He also asked the party’s ministers to see the status of the ministries they lead. “We have to keep track of the budget allocated to the ministries led by the UML,” Oli said, directing the party’s lawmakers to openly discuss the budget in the party and in Parliament.He also accused the government of failing to pay enough attention to development activities. “Our party joined the government to stop poverty and advance development. If that is not happening, how can we be satisfied?” Oli said.Stating that the percentage of the poor had now increased, Oli claimed that poverty had been reduced significantly during his premiership, which lasted over three years until July 2021.A UML central committee leader told the Post that Oli has already expressed his dissatisfaction with the budget with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Oli’s second instance of expressing his displeasure with the budget signals a growing misunderstanding between the two leaders, UML leaders said. Oli wants more spending in the sectors of entrepreneurship and infrastructure.He urged the UML ministers to study the budget but directed the party’s lawmakers not to comment on it on social media platforms. “It’d be better to express your concerns and comments at party meetings,” Oli told UML lawmakers.Also on Saturday, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the opposition Nepali Congress, raised questions about the government’s activities. The UML is in government, but the party is acting as if it is not a part of it, he said. “The UML first sent junior party leaders to the Cabinet. Now it has stopped owning up the government’s activities,” Thapa shared his observation.When the UML goes to people, it takes no responsibility for the government’s works, he said. “They are acting as though the UML was not consulted while the Maoists prepared the budget.”The party had deputed former finance minister Bishnu Poudel to provide inputs and suggestions for the budget. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nDays after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said. \nDead bodies of a man and a woman were found on a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, located on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.According to the Kathmandu Valley Police Office, the bodies were spotted approximately 200 metres down the hill from the Kathmandu-Dakshinkali road.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Raj Mainali said that the preliminary investigation suggests they died in an accident, as a crashed motorcycle was found near the bodies.Mainali said a disaster management team of Nepal Police is working to retrieve the bodies from the hill. He said locals informed the police after spotting the bodies on Wednesday evening.The police said the deceased woman is a 32-year-old resident of Changunarayan Municipality-5, while the man is yet to be identified. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said on Tuesday that despite Nepal’s negligible contribution to global emissions, the country has been disproportionately hit by the adverse effects of climate change.He urged the global lenders for climate justice and compensation for the loss and damage incurred due to circumstances that were and are beyond Nepal’s control.“For the least-developed countries like Nepal, debt concessionality [concessional lending] is critical,” said Dahal, speaking at the 21st replenishment meeting of the International Development Association (IDA21). For the first time in Nepal, the consultative meeting is being held over four days. Replenishing IDA’s resources will be a vital topic of the meeting, which comes at the midpoint of a funding cycle concluding in December 2024—when donors commit to contributions for July 2025 to June 2028.The third IDA21 meeting in Kathmandu brought together officials from 65 donor governments and representatives of borrowing member countries to discuss the proposed IDA21 policy focus areas—people, planet, prosperity, infrastructure, and digitalisation. Donors meet every three years to replenish IDA resources and review its policy framework. Officials from the donor governments and representatives of borrowing member countries ensure that IDA’s policy and financing frameworks are responsive to the country's needs and current challenges.They will also look at financing scenarios—the level of donor contributions required to support these scenarios—and assess the financing needs of countries supported by IDA.After years of promises of new climate funding, the developing world is coming to grips with a disappointing reality that not enough funding is coming to address the challenges of climate change.Nepal's diverse geo-climatic system, which combines heavy monsoons, steep terrain, and remoteness, renders the country vulnerable to natural disasters.According to the National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, released by the National Statistics Office recently, the economic losses in both farm and off-farm sectors over the last five years, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say that due to extreme climate behaviour, farmers might lose the basis of their livelihoods, and even those who have escaped poverty may be dragged back into it.“We are vulnerable to multiple crises. The climate crisis could reverse our hard-won development gains,” said the prime minister.IDA is the part of the World Bank that invests in the future of people and the planet, with projects across 75 countries. Established in 1960, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing grants and zero- to low-interest loans for programmes that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions.Dahal said that Nepal has faced significant challenges, including devastating earthquakes, disasters, the Covid pandemic, and economic slowdown, which have caused substantial output losses and hindered the country’s progress towards economic prosperity. “To ensure sustainable and resilient growth, we are adopting our homegrown Green Resilient Inclusive Development (GRID) approach, prioritising ten key transition sectors and actions to be accomplished over the next decade,” said Dahal, showcasing Nepal's determination to overcome the challenges of climate change.He said Nepal’s development priority and GRID approach align with the World Bank's evolution roadmap and global challenge programmes. He said that IDA’s commitment to strengthening country-driven models will empower countries to take ownership of their development agendas, foster inclusive stakeholder engagement, and build robust institutions and systems. “Realising this fact, we wish to work closely with IDA and other stakeholders to streamline this approach in the IDA21 cycle.”Nepal has been an active IDA borrower for over six decades. During this period, IDA has been a significant source of development finance for Nepal and has delivered impact. “With this support, Nepal has achieved significant outcomes in infrastructure building and social development overall,” Dahal said, instilling hope for a brighter future with continued support from IDA. “We would like to request you to continue the same moving forward. I agree that we have capacity constraints in a new federal context. Project execution performance is slowing, and spending is low,” Dahal said.“We may need to restructure our policy framework, but policy change cannot occur overnight in a democratic system. That's why you are here to support us with patience to continue our development aspiration to increase the speed and impact of IDA and to build a common hope.” The prime minister said Nepal's key strengths include its strategic location between two of Asia's largest economies, abundant hydropower resources, thriving tourism and agribusiness sectors, and a young, hardworking population.Sheku Sambadeen Sesay, the independent co-chair of IDA21 Replenishment, said IDA works similarly across 75 countries worldwide. “If I look at my own country, Sierra Leone, IDA has contributed a lot. The civil war ravaged Sierra Leone from 1991 to 2002 and destroyed the country's infrastructure, including its health systems.Sesay said that IDA moved in swiftly with the construction work, and today, at least, the country is at a stage where it has the conditions for take-off.Sesay sees IDA as a complete package as it brings technical assistance and knowledge, builds capacity and affects policy change. IDA contributes as a package, mostly co-financing with countries that can't afford high interest rates.Axel van Trotsenburg, senior managing director of Development Policy and Partnership at the World Bank, said the next few days would be crucial. “This forum will help the beneficiary countries embrace very proactive results-oriented programmes. It will be for the donor countries to see how that package could facilitate the maximum generosity when the pledging comes,” Trotsenburg said.He said it would be up to the bank to see how IDA can do more and contribute even further to a successful outcome. \nNow Nepali customers can personalise their mobile number by choosing the last six digits that resonate with their hearts. Whether it's their birthday, the date they first met their partner, their vehicle number, or any other significant moment, Ncell has launched the ‘Sadhain ON’ special number. The company said that customers can also gift such special numbers to their loved ones. “In this scheme, mobile numbers start with the number range 9705.Customers who wish to own such special numbers can craft the last six digits to make it uniquely theirs.

The last date for registration is June 20, and children chefs aged 7 to 15 years are eligible to participate. Participants will have the opportunity to showcase their culinary skills and creativity, all while vying for the coveted title of Hyatt Place Kathmandu presents Jr MasterChef. With an entry fee of just Rs2,000 per child, which includes a lavish buffet lunch, young chefs can dive into a culinary adventure like never before, the hotel said. Baburam Sharma, head chef of Hyatt Place Kathmandu, Pradeep Parajuli, principal and managing director of Liberty College, and Tasneem Shahani, a home chef and restaurateur, make the jury.  \nOn Monday morning, long queues snaked out of various state-run petrol stations across the Kathmandu Valley, causing frustration and long waits for motorists. This was for the first time in years that the Kathmandu Valley was seeing motorist queues.The situation arose due to a protest launched by petroleum transport workers who stopped supplying fuel to private pumps. They were protesting against their employers—petroleum dealers—accusing them of not implementing the minimum wage for workers as fixed by the government and excluding them from the social safety net. According to petroleum workers, petroleum transportation is one of the most dangerous jobs, yet lacks a social safety net.The protest, which began Friday, took a nasty turn after private petrol pumps ran out of fuel on Monday. Frantic motorists then started queuing up at state-owned petrol pumps. Videos and photos immediately went viral on social media, showing never-ending lines in front of petrol stations owned by Nepal Police in Naxal and other fuel stations.“We’ve been waiting for an hour,” said Saroj Karki, whose motorbike was already running empty.“This is totally frustrating. How can the government be so irresponsible,” said Karki, who was waiting at the Bhadrakali petrol pump run by the Nepal Army on Monday afternoon. Karki, a sales manager for a private company, said that he was scheduled to attend two meetings in different places. “It's 12:30, and the queue hasn’t moved at all. I don’t know what to do.” However, the streets of the Valley saw less traffic pressure on Monday due to a public holiday. Since Friday, most private petrol pumps have hung up “no petrol” signs. The issue was resolved late Monday afternoon after the government decided to form a committee to address the grievances of the petroleum transport workers. There are more than 2,100 petroleum transport workers in the country. People also expressed frustrations on social media. “One thing I like about the proliferation of electric vehicles in Nepal is that we will not be held ransom by different cartels of labour, transporters, fuel station owners and an inefficient, corrupt, constantly No Oil Corporation (NOC)!” Sujeev Shakya wrote on X. Ajay Das posted a video on X showing a long queue of motorists. He wrote, “This is not Kathmandu traffic, it’s the queue at Naxal Police petrol pump this morning.” On August 18 last year, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security implemented the monthly wage of workers, except for tea estate workers, at Rs17,300 as per Section 106 of the Labour Act, 2017. The monthly basic salary has been fixed at Rs10,820, and the dearness allowance at Rs6,480. The daily wage has been fixed at Rs668 and Rs89 per hour. Similarly, the hourly wage for part-time workers has been fixed at Rs95 per hour.But the petroleum transport workers said they have not received the hiked monthly wages and allowances. “We tried to settle the issue on Sunday morning but were not successful,” said Manoj Kumar Thakur, deputy director of Nepal Oil Corporation, the state-owned oil monopoly.The Kathmandu Valley consumes 700 kiloliters of petrol and 800 kiloliters of diesel daily. This requires 75-100 petroleum tankers to supply petrol and diesel from Thankot depo to different pumps in the Valley. On Saturday, the oil supplier reduced the prices of petroleum products. Petrol price was cut by Rs3 per litre to Rs165 per litre, while diesel and kerosene became cheaper by Re1 each, to Rs152 per litre.“Despite the monthly minimum salary of Rs17,300 determined by the Labour Act, we are receiving Rs8,000 to Rs10,000 per month. Only a few get Rs15,000, and that’s too below the government-set wages,” said Ishwar Lama, president of Nepal Petroleum Tank Divers Association.“We have not even been included in the social security scheme,” Lama said. “We are hopeful that our demand will be addressed this time, or else we will launch a nationwide protest.”According to the Nepal Oil Corporation, petroleum transport drivers stopped unloading fuel, petrol, and diesel from the corporation's Thankot depot on Sunday morning. The depot is open from 9 am to 5 pm.Lama said that during a meeting held at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, they agreed to the government’s proposal to form a committee to address the issues raised by the workers. The committee has been given 15 days to submit the report. The petroleum transport workers have put forth a seven-point demand.The committee is led by the deputy managing director of Nepal Oil Corporation with representatives from the Industry Ministry, Nepal Petroleum Tanker Drivers Association, Nepal Transportation Workers Association and All Nepal Petroleum Workers’ Union.Lilendra Pradhan, president of Nepal Petroleum Dealers National Association, said that petroleum tanker drivers have not been included in the social security scheme as they have been compelled to work without appointment letters. Thakur of Nepal Oil Corporation alleged that petroleum dealers were not providing salaries and benefits to petroleum transport workers, and they were not even included in social safety schemes. “As petroleum dealers are appointed by the corporation, we have to play the role of facilitator to resolve the issue.”On June 11, the Nepal Petroleum Tank Drivers Association had issued an ultimatum to the Nepal Oil Corporation. As part of the protest, petroleum transport workers began protesting on Friday by wearing black bands around their arms.The tank drivers' association has demanded that all drivers be provided appointment letters as per the Labour Act and salaries as determined by the government. \nThe Department of Drug Administration has suspended the sales and distribution of Biotax 1gm, an antibiotic injection manufactured by an Indian firm, citing serious health risks.According to the department, the national drug regulatory body, laboratory testing of the ‘Biotax 1gm’ batch F300460, manufactured by Indian pharma company Zydus Healthcare Ltd, revealed that the drug was not in compliance with the production specifications.“We have directed the manufacturing company, importers and distributors to immediately suspend sales, import and distribution of the said medicine, until further notice,” said Pramod KC, spokesperson at the department. “Some serious issues have been detected in the said antibiotic. Decisions about further actions will be taken once the investigation is completed.”Biotax 1gm injection is an antibiotic medicine used to treat bacterial infections, including those of the brain, lungs, ear, urinary tract, skin, soft tissues, bones and joints, blood, and heart. It is also used to prevent infections during surgery.According to the department, which carried out the testing in its own laboratory, BIOTAX-1gm batch F300460 is not safe for use and could risk patients’ lives.KC said that the decision to suspend the sales of the injection was made to ensure patient safety and would not affect the treatment, as other drugs with the same composition are available in the market.“Injection of the same composition manufactured by other companies are available in the market,” said KC. “The suspension of sales will not affect the treatment of patients.”Suspending and recalling substandard drugs from the market is routine work and part of the department's risk reduction measures. Officials said that several medicines found to be substandard have also been suspended from sales and distribution or recalled in the past. However, it is not known if all those substandard drugs were successfully recalled or some were sold to patients, as the department does not have the capacity to ensure timely recess of all substandard medicines.The regulatory agency regularly collects drugs through random sampling methods from pharmacies across the country and tests them in its own laboratory to ensure compliance with quality standards.DDA officials admit that due to understaffing, they cannot always monitor if all those drugs have been recalled or not.The department publishes a notice on its website asking respective companies to recall those drugs as soon as possible. However, most of the time, those substandard drugs have already been sold out by the time the notices are published, as it takes months, mainly due to understaffing, for the department to conduct tests in its laboratory. \nAs all efforts to control the vectors spreading the dengue virus have failed, health authorities in Nepal have shifted focus to case management. As there is no specific treatment for dengue, officials said they are planning to train doctors to provide supportive care to seriously ailing dengue patients.“We have been working to train doctors serving at state-run health facilities to treat dengue patients,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We hope the training will help doctors manage cases more effectively.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,175 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 122. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, increasing numbers of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as the outbreak of the virus is reported every month including in the winter months.Health authorities in Nepal claimed that lessons from managing Covid cases would help them combat other outbreaks, but the massive infections and spread of the dengue virus before the onset of the monsoon cast doubt on these claims.“Every year, scores die and hundreds of thousands get infected from the dengue virus, but no agency in the country is doing much on disease prevention,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “There are three tiers of government in the country, and the relevant agency in each government—federal, provincial and local—shifts responsibility to another. When you ask the agency under the local level, they say they are not there to kill mosquitoes.”Experts say health authorities have done little to cut down on the risks, except counting the number of infected people and issuing statements. The public, too, has become less vigilant about dengue infections, they sayAccording to entomologists, reducing the spread of the dengue virus is impossible without coordinated efforts from all relevant agencies and individuals.“Several preemptive measures, including a search-and-destroy campaign of mosquito breeding sites, are necessary to curb the spread of the virus,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “People should be made aware of the risks, so awareness drives should be launched. Authorities should deploy community workers to inspect households to find and destroy mosquito breeding grounds.”Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death. \nChildren aged between five and 11 years with compromised immunity will be administered the Covid vaccine, according to health officials.The Covax facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has agreed to provide 100,000 doses of the children’s vaccine, and supply will start in the last week of June, according to officials at the Ministry of Health and Population.“These 100,000 doses are part of the 2.5 million doses, which Covax had agreed to supply to Nepal in 2024,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Children between five and 11 having underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.”Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.The Covax facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine, which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population.Officials said that Nepal will receive 1.6 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccine by the end of this month, including the children’s vaccine, from Covax. The rest of the doses of the monovalent vaccine to be received later will be administered to the adult population in all provinces of the country. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid.The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components: the original virus strain and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nAt least one case of cholera, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, has been confirmed in Kathmandu.According to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, a 62-year-old man from Makwanpur district, who had been admitted with severe diarrhoea some two weeks ago, tested positive for the deadly disease.The man is said to have been residing in Kathmandu for a long time.“The health condition of the patient was serious when he was brought to our hospital,” said a health worker serving at the Hospital’s Emergency Department, asking not to be named, as the official was not authorised to speak to the media. “The stool test confirmed a cholera infection.”According to health workers at the hospital, Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in stool samples of infected patients.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.The Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak in the monsoon of 2022 in which 77 cholera-positive cases were confirmed. Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.”Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.”Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago. An Indian national who is a truck driver was admitted to the Sukraraj Hospital at that time.“We had mobilised our team to investigate the source of the outbreak,” said Sapkota. Doctors warn that concealing outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and failing to investigate their sources and inform the public about the risks can prove counterproductive, as the deadly bacteria keep spreading in communities if preventative measures are not taken.Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected with them every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main catalysts for the spread of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City that were highly affected by the outbreak. In October 2021, a Vibrio cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu district killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man.Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts failed to curb the infection.The World Health Organisation says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera.A combination of careful survey, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nThe Nepali cricket team will return home from the T20 World Cup with their heads held high despite yet another near miss in pulling off their first-ever win over a Test nation in Kingstown. After being agonisingly close to capping one of the biggest upsets in cricket history against South Africa two days ago, the Rhinos, led by the tournament’s youngest captain Rohit Paudel, had Bangladesh, another full member nation, on the ropes with their eye-popping bowling display on Monday.Nepal opted to field first after winning the toss and wrapped up the Tigers for a low total of 106, with Sompal Kami, Dipendra Singh Airee, Rohit Paudel and Sandeep Lamichhane all dominating with the ball with two wickets apiece.They had come within two runs of overhauling a slightly bigger target against the Proteas, and the 107-run target was something they would have settled for. But Nepal’s batters could not cope with the bowling masterclass of Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Mustafizur Rahman, and were eventually all out for 85 against a Bangladeshi side that needed at least one point to ensure progress to the Super Eight stage.“As a bowling unit, we bowled really well. As a batting unit, we could have done better, especially the top order batters. We could have batted tighter,” Paudel said at the presentation following the loss.“Bangladesh bowled really well with the new ball and we were under pressure after that. They were asking us challenging questions. We built a little partnership after that, but top order batters could have done better and taken more responsibility.”It was a game of bowlers at the Arnos Vale Ground that assisted both spinners and seamers.Fast bowler Sompal Kami struck with the first ball of the innings to dismiss Tanzid Hasan for a golden duck, setting the tone for Nepal.Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (four off five) was the next to go when Dipendra Singh Airee bowled him in the next over.Kami then got rid of Litton Das (10 off 12) in the fourth over, before Towhid Hridoy (9 off 7) fell to Paudel after hitting two fours, which left Bangladesh reeling at 31-4 at the end of the powerplay.Mahmudullah and Shakib Al Hasan tried to rebuild the innings, limping past 50, but Bangladesh found themselves on the back foot again when Mahmudullah (13 off 13) was frustratingly run out due to miscommunication.Paudel then got another breakthrough wicket of Bangladesh, trapping Shakib (17 off 22) with a sharp turning ball, before Lamichhane piled more pressure with two crucial wickets of Tanzim (three off five) and Jaker Ali (12 off 26) that also gave him his 100th T20I wickets in his 54th match for Nepal.But Rishad Hossain added 13 runs off seven balls and Taskin played 12 not out off 15 balls for the last two wickets, which would prove crucial in the end.-What went wrong against Bangladesh?-The target seemed achievable. But Nepal repeated the same mistake with the bat. They failed to make maximum use of the powerplay and their strike rotation was poor. And by the time they were in the stage of taking more risks in the chase, it was already too late.Against South Africa, when they pushed the game to the last ball, a sense of belief had popped up that Nepal had saved their best with the bat for the crucial meetings after having struggled for much of the year.But against Bangladesh, they collapsed sooner and were only able to add 24 runs from the powerplay after Tanzim ripped apart the top order including a double-wicket maiden in the third over.By the time Tanzim bowled his fourth over in the seventh of the innings, he had thrown 21 dots and taken four of the first five wickets —that included the wickets of Kushal Bhurtel (four off eight), Anil Sah (0), Paudel (one off six) and Sundeep Jora (one off eight)—leaving Nepal a mountain to climb.Tanzim’s 21 dot balls was the most by any bowler in a men’s T20 World Cup match.Kushal Malla (27 off 40) and Dipendra Singh Airee (25 off 31) indeed started the recovery but Nepal needed 23 balls to finally break the boundary drought as they limped past 50 after 12 overs.Nepal raised the tempo in the 16th over when Malla hit Mahmudullah for a six and a four to complete a fifty-run partnership with Airee for the sixth wicket, which took them to 77-5. They now needed 30 off the last four overs, which raised hopes of an upset.A successful chase was still viable for Nepal but inexperience caught up with them.Mustafizur, who had taken the wicket of Aasif Sheikh to cap an excellent powerplay for Bangladesh, returned for his third over and gave Nepal another nightmare.Nepal were able to eke out just one run off Mustafizur in the 17th and the loss of Malla in the 16.4 was something the Rhinos could not afford.Airee hit Taskin with a six in the first ball of the 18th over and added one more in the 17.3 to close the gap on the target but it was the last run Nepal could manage.After Taskin dismissed Gulsan Jha, Mustafizur bowled five dots in a row in the 19th over before getting Airee’s wicket that ended Nepal’s hopes of ending the tournament on a high note.Shakib then completed the team’s hat-trick dismissing Kami and Bohara in the successive balls in the 20th over.Paudel was left disappointed with the way Nepal batted against Bangladesh.“We need to step up… need to know where to score runs and how to assess conditions. In the field and with the ball, we are up to the mark, we need to improve with the bat,” Paudel said.-‘Sense of belonging’-Nepal exited the World Cup without a win in Group D. But their spirited fight in the last two games, especially against South Africa, sent a message that Nepal belong with the elites and could be joining their ranks soon.“This team has great potential. There are a lot of positives to take, especially the way we played at the Asia Cup and now the World Cup against good teams,” Paudel said. “So I think the sense of belonging is there in the team.”Paudel reiterated that Nepal need more exposure against full-member nations if they are to grow and improve. Nepal have had the opportunity to play only a handful of games against Test nations. In the World Cup warm-ups as well, they were matched against associate nations Canada and the United States.“And if you back this team and play good cricket with good teams like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and everyone else… if you play with them [regularly], I think there will be improvement in us.”One more thing Nepal will regret is their six-wicket defeat against familiar rivals Netherlands in their opening game. A win against the Dutch could have scripted a whole new tournament for the Rhinos. The no result against Sri Lanka also contributed to Nepal’s poor opening at the World Cup.But Nepal will have to work on their batting if they are to announce their emergence on the global stage. \nBangladesh defeated Nepal by 21 runs in their last match of the T20 World Cup played at the Arnos Vale Stadium in St. Vincent, West Indies.Chasing a modest 107-target by Bangladesh, the Rhinos were bowled out for 85 runs. With this Nepal have been knocked out of the T20 World Cup winless from the group stage.Nepal’ s innings faltered from the start in the run chase.Nepal’s top order struggled, with key batters Kushal Bhurtel and Anil Sah falling cheaply for four runs and a duck respectively.Despite a fighting 27 off 40 balls knock by Kushal Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee’s 25 off 31, Nepal's batting lineup collapsed under pressure as they were bundled out for just 85 runs. Tanzim Hasan Sakib struck early, taking the wicket of Nepali opener Bhurtel. Sakib claimed four wickets for just seven runs in his four-over spell. Mustafizur Rahman was equally impressive, taking three wickets for seven runs. Shakib Al Hasan chipped in with two wickets for nine runs, sealing the fate of Nepal's innings at 85 in 19.2 overs.Earlier, Bangladesh were confined to 106 runs in 19.3 overs.Shakib Al Hasan’ s 17 off 22 balls was the top score, with Litton Das and Mahmudullah contributing 10 and 13 runs respectively.Nepal's bowlers delivered a commendable performance, with Sompal Kami, Dipendra Singh Airee, Rohit Paudel, and Sandeep Lamichhane each taking two wickets. Sompal Kami took 2 wickets conceding 10 runs and Lamichhane was particularly effective as he conceded just 17 runs in his four-over spell. After the match Rohit Paudel (Nepal skipper) said that as a bowling unit they bowled well but as a batting unit they could have been tighter. “Bangladesh bowled really well and after the first six overs we were four down and it put a lot of pressure on us. The top order batters could have taken more responsibility. I think they bowled really well in the powerplay,” Paudel said. “As a batting unit, we need to step up. We need to understand where to score runs. I think in bowling we were up to the mark but as a batting unit, we need to work a lot.”He said he believed this team has a bright future but needed to work harder. “We will do better in the upcoming World Cups.\" \nWith a bit of luck Nepal’s fairytale victory would have been secured.The country’s hopes of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup ended after they lost to cricketing powerhouse South Africa by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller in their Group D match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent on Saturday.But their spirited performance earned praise worldwide after almost pulling off an upset win over one of the tournament favourites.Fielding first after winning the toss, the Rhinos restricted a strong Proteas team to a subpar 115-7 with their stupendous spin attack as Dipendra Singh Airee and part-time bowler Kushal Bhurtel shared all seven wickets that fell between them on a turning track.But they fell agonisingly short from recording their historic first ever victory over an ICC’s full-member nation after they could only manage 114-7.Despite the heartbreak, Nepal’s performance caught attention worldwide.“A performance to be proud of. Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.”Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them.“Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.”Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!”“Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group. \nGermany thrashed 10-man Scotland 5-1 on Friday with three goals in the first half to make a triumphant start to their Euro 2024 campaign and lay down a marker with the biggest opening game margin of victory in the tournament’s history.The Germans, hunting a record fourth European title and first major trophy after a barren decade, scored through Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and a Kai Havertz penalty before Niclas Fuellkrug and Emre Can added two more late in the second half.Scotland, who had defender Ryan Porteous sent off on the stroke of halftime, got on the scoresheet in the 87th minute courtesy of Antonio Ruediger’s deflected own goal.Julian Nagelsmann’s Germany next face Hungary on Wednesday before taking on Switzerland in their final Group A match.“We played with a lot of intensity and played the right spaces, took some risks and that is why we scored. We played an outstanding first half and we were up 3-0,” Germany captain Ilkay Guendogan said.“That is how we wanted to start. I had a good feeling before the game and I was proved right.”“The start is what we wanted but still the goal we let in showed that all teams have quality and if you don't pay attention you will be punished.”The Scots, who lost Porteous for a studs-up challenge on Guendogan that earned the hosts their penalty, must quickly go back to the drawing board and regroup if they are to make it past the group stage for the first time in a major tournament.POWERFUL STARTThe Germans, who lost their opening matches at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups as well as the previous Euros in 2021, dominated possession from the start with the Scots defending high.That ambitious strategy proved fatal for the visitors, who left far too many open spaces at the back, and it did not take long for the hosts to punish them.Toni Kroos flighted a perfect 30-metre cross for Joshua Kimmich who timed his pass to Wirtz perfectly for the winger to drill home for a 10th minute lead and become the youngest scorer for Germany at a Euros aged 21.With Scotland still recovering, Germany struck again nine minutes later, with Guendogan slipping another ball past the Scottish backline, this time for Havertz on the left, with the forward laying it off for Musiala in the box to rifle home.It was the start all of Germany was hoping for as hundreds of thousands of supporters across several fan zones erupted with joy, but there was more to come with Porteus’ reckless challenge and dismissal conceding a spot kick Havertz easily converted.It was one-way traffic again after the break and Germany added a fourth through substitute Fuellkrug’s fiercely struck shot in the 69th as Scotland coach Steve Clarke, the first man to lead the team to back-to-back Euros, looked on helplessly.“First half, we just got it all wrong really, didn’t show up, weren’t aggressive enough, and we let good players get on the ball,” said Scotland captain Andy Robertson.“Second half, we’re down to 10 men and I thought the lads dug in really well. We have to bounce back quickly because there was lots wrong here and it’s a quick turnaround now.”Scotland, who did not have one effort on or off target, pulled a goal back late on when Ruediger inadvertently headed the ball into his own net but substitute Emre Can then curled home a fine shot in stoppage time for the Germans’ fifth goal.The reeling Scots next play the Swiss on Wednesday. \nNepal blew their chances of qualifying for the Super Eight of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup after losing to South Africa by a single run in a last-over nail-biter at the Arnos Vale Ground in West Indies.The Rhinos had everything on the line and were in need of two runs off the last ball of the game when Gulshan Jha was caught between the wickets by Quinton de Kock.Earlier, the Rhinos put up a great bowling display, restricting South Africa, who were sent to bat first, to a lowly total of 115 runs.Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 runs off 11 balls before being dismissed by Dipendra Singh Airee in 3.4 overs. Kushal Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after.Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks managed to stay on the ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavilion by Airee in 15.3 overs.Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play.Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-over spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs.Despite the easy chase, Nepal found themselves on the losing end, putting up 114 runs at a loss of seven wickets at the end of the stipulated 20 overs.The Rhinos were off to a good start with openers Bhurtel and Aashif Sheikh building a decent first-wicket partnership. However, the tides turned quickly for Nepal as South Africa’s Tabraiz Shamsi struck twice in a single over, dismissing Bhurtel for 13 in 7.2 overs, and captain Rohit Paudel for a duck only two deliveries later.Sheikh stood undeterred, building a half-century partnership with Anil Sah to bring some much-needed relief to the Nepali innings. Sah scored 27 runs, which featured three boundaries and a six, before being caught by Marco Jansen off Aiden Markram.Just as the innings were steadying for the Rhinos, Shamsi struck again, proving a thorn in Nepal’s flesh. Nepal were in need of 18 runs off as many deliveries at the end of 16 overs when they dealt a massive blow, losing Dipendra Singh Airee (6), Aasif Sheikh (42) and Kushal Malla (1) in a span of five balls.Tension ran high as Nepal were still in need of eight runs with an over to spare. Gulshan Jha, who took to the field at number seven, missed twice, narrowing the game down to eight runs with four deliveries in hand.Jha then smashed a boundary. The game was down to two runs off as many balls, but he missed again. With only a single delivery remaining, Jha and his partner Sompal Kami made the run for an equaliser, but the former was run out, ending Nepal’s hopes of competing in the World Cup.For South Africa, Tabraiz Shamsi grabbed four wickets while Aiden Markram also dismissed a Nepali batter. \nIndia faced a severe heatwave with 40,000 heatstroke cases and over 100 deaths, while the northeast experienced floods from heavy rain, killing six and affecting over 160,000.\nNorth Korea and Russia sign defense pact, pledging mutual assistance against attacks, with North Korea declaring an \"alliance\" and \"unconditional support\" for Russia's actions in Ukraine.\nIndia endures extreme weather with severe heatwaves causing deaths in Delhi, while landslides and floods in Assam kill at least 11, including a woman and her three daughters.\nMultiple fatalities, numbering in the hundreds, have occurred during this year's hajj in Mecca due to extreme heat, with Egypt reporting the highest number of deaths.\nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nPrivate hospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, Butwal, and other regions blatantly disregard regulations by neglecting to provide free treatment to underprivileged patients, despite government mandates requiring them to allocate 10% of their beds for such services.\nThe Poet Laureate of the 1950s, Laxmi Prasad Devkota (1909-1959), penned a lyrical essay, “Ke Nepal Sano Chha?” (Is Nepal small?), and claimed that Bharatmatako Mutu (The heart of mother Bharat) was “pretty, quiet and great”. The essayist takes cringeworthy poetic licences to glorify his homeland where “Wagner is using a spade, Shakespeare could be ploughing, Titian and Turner may be tending the sheep, Socrates contemplating in a cave …”! Every country, irrespective of its size, has the right to adore itself if it doesn’t degenerate into collective narcissism. But it’s dangerous to fantasise that someone else will help end its misery or to hallucinate that all others are conspiring to harm its interests. The anxiety that Narendra Modi’s electoral enthronement as a third-term prime minister of the most populous country in the world has caused everywhere is real. A beacon of hope for the freshly freed countries since the 1950s, India was often cited as an exemplar of slow but steady path from exploitative governance to social justice through democratic processes. By re-electing “one of the worst autocratisers” for the third time, albeit with a lower margin, a significant section of Indian voters has shown that it values religious gratification of Hindutva chauvinism much more than its democratic credentials. Nepal was once “the only Hindu Kingdom” of the world, and it’s perhaps understandable that remnants of the ancien régime of the Shah and Rana clan look towards the entrenched Hindutva establishment in New Delhi with a poignant sense of longing and hope. The sadness comes from the realisation that the Hindutva lobby in India doesn’t care much about what happens to the conservative elements in Kathmandu. Hope rekindles whenever a minor functionary of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) makes a promissory statement to support the restoration of “Hindu Rashtra” in Nepal. However, the wishful expectations of Hindutva factions in the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party and the Nepali Congress stand on shaky grounds: Indian foreign policy is dictated by its geostrategic compulsions, geoeconomic considerations and geopolitical options. Cultural diplomacy is merely a tool at the hands of its adroit practitioners. Fears of former Naxals, such as the de facto supremo of the ruling alliance Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli or the degenerate Maoists of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s ilk, appear to be equally unfounded. National interests invariably triumph over ideological considerations in the implementation of foreign policy. The priorities of Modi 3.0 towards Nepal are unlikely to be much different from what they have been since 2015—quiet behind-the-scenes manoeuvres combined with studied indifference in public.Strategic irrelevanceThe Gandhian dreams of self-rule, self-sufficiency, social justice, non-domination and ethical rightness fired the Indian Independence Movement. The Nehruvian pursuit of modernity in political economy laid the foundations of a country emerging from some of the worst excesses of British colonialism. The Ambedkarite idea of India as “a social democracy firmly established on the principles of liberty, equality, fraternity, and humanity” remained an aspiration till the aughties. Meanwhile, revivalists of “Hindu glory” had a completely different idea of India since the early 1920s.The leadership of the Sangh Parivar wanted to replace all secular ambitions with the Savarkarite concept of Hindutva hegemony in a civilisational state of, for, and by the people who had their homeland, motherland, fatherland, and holy land within the Akhand Bharat. When Premier Modi assumed office in 2014, he took care to cloak the Hindutva agenda with economic rhetoric. He managed to dupe some people for almost a decade with an enticing slogan of inclusive development. Back in the saddle with the cobbled majority of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and forced to rely on temperamental partners in the coalition, he has once again begun to repeat his beguiling bombasts of the past.On the domestic front, Premier Modi may be forced to dilute his hardline Hindutva to maintain the cohesion within the NDA. However, the continuation of his team for external affairs shows that Indian foreign policy will stay its course. S. Jaishankar’s suave toughness has been retained by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Speaking at the First Gateway of India Dialogue in 2016 as the top bureaucrat of MEA, Jaishankar closed his speech with a statement of purpose: “A new normal is in the making, one where the business of Indian diplomacy is increasingly business.” Jaishankar will continue to be tasked with procuring petroleum products from Russia, industrial goods from China, advancing military hardware from countries of the West, and managing the contradictions of being simultaneously in the Chinese-dominated BRICS and the US-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. The sophisticated but blunt former bureaucrat shall be the face of Modi 3.0 in the international arena. A scholar, Jaishankar, can elucidate about India being “non-Western” and “not anti-Western”, ignoring the distinction without an inherent difference in the proposition. Multipolarity is an oxymoron, and multi-alignment is just a jargon in the bipolar world of the Cold War II. Despite its geoeconomic handshake with the Russians, the geostrategic foot of Indian diplomacy finds Western grounds firmer and friendlier than its Chinese challengers.Perhaps the former spymaster Ajit Doval will have a more prominent role in geostrategic affairs as the third-time National Security Advisor. He has been elevated to the rank of a Cabinet Minister and put on par with the former secretary of the MEA. When National Security Advisor of the United States Jake Sullivan came to New Delhi on June 17, 2024, he did meet Jaishankar. Still, he held “comprehensive discussion on a broad range of issues” with his counterpart. If Nepal figured at all in their conversations, it probably was connected with countering the Chinese influence in South Asia.Tactical impassivityFrom the legions of the imperial epoch through the armada of the colonial era to the cyber security challenges of the AI age, economic considerations have always remained the main concern of all competing powers. Tall talks of tourism and hydropower notwithstanding, Nepal is essentially a resource-poor country with the export of unskilled and semi-skilled youths to the labour markets of the world as its primary source of income. There is a reason the four pillars of Premier Modi’s economic team—Ambani, Adani, Tata and Jindal—aren’t too keen on investing in the land of Pashupatinath.Competency in science and technology is important in determining the strategic significance of relatively smaller countries. Nepal’s last indigenous innovation was the watermill. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are unlikely to prefer Banepa over Bengaluru in setting up their data management facilities.Nepal can no longer count upon the remaining Bharatmatako Mutu with Premier Modi’s Agnipath scheme on stream, and recruitment of Nepali Gurkhas in suspension. The four-time prime minister of Britain, William Ewart Gladstone (1809–1898), described the first principle of his foreign policy: Good government at home. Nepal must discard its obsession with the paranoid “yam between boulders” formulation and aim to be a confident pipal tree growing out of the crevices of the mighty rocks. \nThe day I met Rima (name changed), it was already late morning and she was anxious. There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rima’s body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rima’s house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rima’s quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepal’s decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepal’s conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepal’s history.Devi Khadka’s story had haunted me for years. I’d read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known ‘feminist’ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, it’s easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, “I’ve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.” Yet, some from Nepal’s transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her “political” and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. I’ve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, she’s been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepal’s transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as well—a way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepal’s transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepal’s wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal player—not a victim any more, but a leader—will strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist. Her film ‘Devi’ is screening at the DocEdge Festival in New Zealand in June. \n“Microfinance is not simply banking, it is a development tool”, defined the World Bank 25 years ago. Microfinance activities involve small loans, informal appraisal of borrowers and investment collateral substitutes with group guarantees or compulsory savings, micro-savings and, sometimes, micro-insurance services generally to the populace unbanked by the so-called mainstream financial services and commercial banking.There was an era when the microfinance model of development finance was hailed as a panacea to almost every socioeconomic problem. It was portrayed as a tool to reduce poverty, increase financial access and inclusion, provide formal financial services to the unbanked population, promote gender equality and empower women, support income generation and self-employment schemes, proliferate small and micro enterprises and so on. The United Nations designated 2005 as the International Year of Microcredit. The “Grameen” model of rural finance pioneered in the early 1980s by Bangladeshi economist (and later Nobel Laurette) Mohammad Yunus was replicated in about a hundred developing and a few developed countries. Ironic, though, that he received a Nobel Peace Prize (2006), not in economics.But by now, all the hoopla has sublimated, and microfinance as a development finance instrument is, in totality, considered a failed model. A study by the University of California, Berkley, concludes, “Microfinance is not the cure-all for worldwide poverty that international organizations, financial institutions, and countries have claimed it to be. Microfinance is not designed to end the cycle of poverty”. Rather, microfinancing, with the high cost of borrowing, further perpetuates poverty. “Many microloan and credit recipients are not likely to be able to pay off the loan in a timely manner, so they find themselves in an even worse place when their interest accumulates.” A report with a few different findings has also been published in the Stanford Social Innovation Review.Promoting businesses has also proved to be a big farce globally. In some countries, such as South Africa, 94 percent of micro-borrowers were found using the funds for social and family functions. Simply, these microcredit clients are neither likely to have the “next big idea” to expand their businesses nor are they likely to find larger investors to upscale their business operations substantially.Often exaggerated benefits, mostly non-economical ones, of microfinance have always shadowed the exorbitantly higher interest rates thrust upon poor borrowers. In some countries like Mexico, the total cost of funds is calculated up to 200 percent; in countries like Cambodia and Nepal, it ranges between 20 to 30 percent. Apparently, the rate of return on investment must at least be 100 percent for a borrower to pay the interest, sustain the business and support the family as a self-employed individual, which is beyond economic logic. Case in point: NepalNepal started the microfinance nature of development financing nearly six decades ago, in 1967, with the establishment of the Agricultural Department Bank. Its aim was to help finance the farmers to modernise their farming practices and commercialise agricultural products. Several other experiments followed, like the Small Farmer Development Scheme in the 1970s, to replicate the Grameen model by establishing five rural development banks in each of the then-five development regions in the early 1990s. These banks were promoted by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank of Nepal, with its direct investment. With the advent of the liberal economic era, several private investors and financial non-governmental organisations (FINGOs) entered the market. The Rural Banks were later privatised.By 2017, the number of central bank-regulated institutions providing microcredits, including microfinance institutions (MFIs), FINGOs and saving and credit cooperatives (before mushrooming) reached 103. At present, according to NRB data, there are 55 microfinance institutions with 6 million members and 2.66 million borrowers with a portfolio of Rs400 billion.The evolution and now looming crisis in Nepal's microfinance industry are not different from the general global scenario. Initially, MFIs were portrayed as tools to increase formal financial access to the unbanked, poor and marginalised population. They were also expected to increase the farm productivity of small farmers, promote micro-enterprises, and, of course, reduce poverty and help accelerate economic growth.These tall tasks were never achieved. There has not been any systematic and comprehensive research on actual benevolent outcomes of microfinance activities on poverty reduction, enterprise development, etc. But lately, the over-indebted “victims” of the MFIs are continuously protesting against exploitation and coercion to pauperise them.The findings of a study by the NRB only reinforced the general belief that MFIs have failed to achieve any articulated objectives except expanding some level of banking literacy in the rural hinterland. Nearly 30 percent of the borrowers’ ticket sizes were less than Rs50,000. Any actual economic activity can hardly be expected of them. Only 18 percent of the deceitful borrowers syphoned 38 percent of disbursed loans by indulging in multiple banking and perceivably circumventing the weak regulatory framework.A long series of misguided policies and authorities' unwillingness to correct them have only aggravated the problem. First, the actual cost of borrowing was never brought into policy discussion. Until the previous year, when the NRB put a 16.5-percent cap, it was often reported that the cost of borrowing from MFIs frequently crossed a 30 percent mark. Resource mobilisation methods of these MFIs as the second-tier intermediaries—borrowing from commercial banks and lending to customers—were essentially faulty. Perhaps the biggest mistake on the part of regulators is to allow these MFIs to list in the stock market, the scribes of which have become soft spots for market manipulators and insider traders. Due to this, despite the poor financial performance of many of these institutions, their share price is constantly on the rise. The stock market index is thus becoming increasingly spurious.Worst of all, even after all the anomalies and shortcomings have come to the fore, the government and regulatory authorities are unwilling to take decisive corrective actions. As the following monetary policy is just around the corner, the monetary authority must gather the courage to salvage the financial system from the menace of microfinance, which has only proven to be a burden to the economy. The only excuse given is that the size of the people involved is not enough to allow a massive market distortion in banking as well as the capital markets. \nCorruption cases against elected officials and bureaucrats have proliferated at the local level, hampering local unit functions and raising concerns about the lack of good governance and transparency in local governments.\nNepali leaders cultivate ties with China to boost their nationalist credentials, but China and Nepal's relations have faced issues, including stalled BRI cooperation and communication gaps.\nNepal spends billions on foreign education for its youth, contributing to remittance growth but losing human capital as young people leave the country for better opportunities.\nThe Nepali government plans to mandate the National ID Card for public services, facing criticism due to lack of widespread distribution, but the ID card aims to replace multiple cards and enhance security through biometric data and a central database, with measures in place to ensure data privacy.\nThe federal system in Nepal, adopted in 2015, faces criticism for its failure to deliver, with ongoing issues in provincial governance, central governance, and a lack of commitment to federalism among political leaders and parties.\nA parliamentary committee formed to investigate a cooperative scam faced challenges defining its jurisdiction due to political pressure, but eventually reached an agreement to probe Deputy Prime Minister Rabi Lamichhane's alleged involvement based on evidence and documents.\nAmnesty International's Secretary General expressed concerns over global human rights backsliding, including civic space shrinkage, digital law overreach, excessive use of force, and impunity in Nepal.\nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) is preparing for its first general convention, seeking to establish clear policies and leadership amid challenges in electoral performance and service delivery.\nPartly cloudy weather with light rainfall expected in eastern provinces; heavy rain forecast in Koshi Province; daily temperature variations recorded across Nepal.\nCloudy weather with scattered light rain and thunderstorms expected in parts of Nepal, including Koshi, Gandaki, Lumbini, Bagmati, and Madhesh provinces; maximum temperature in Nepalgunj reaches 43.8°C.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather with light rain, thunder, and gusty winds predicted in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces on Monday, with similar conditions expected in one or two places elsewhere in the country.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.
