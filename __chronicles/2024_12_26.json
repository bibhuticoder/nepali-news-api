Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe CPN-UML has removed its senior leader Bhim Rawal from the party and stripped him of the party’s ordinary membership. The former UML vice chair and former home and defence minister had for long been without any responsibility due to his differences with party chair KP Oli.In the last UML general convention in November 2021, Rawal had contested against Oli for the post of party chairperson but lost. A UML secretariat meeting decided to strip Rawal of his party membership after assessing his series of statements and activities that were against the party’s official line, said a senior UML leader.Rawal had opposed the party’s decision to accept land donated by Min Bahadur Gurung, the owner of Bhatbhateni supermarket, with the intent of building the party’s headquarters. He publicly spoke against the decision to accept the land, citing Gurung’s “controversial” background. Following his statements, the UML sought clarifications from him and two other female leaders—Binda Pandey and Usha Kiran Timilsina. Pandey is a standing committee member while Timilsina is a central committee member.Talking to the Post, Rawal termed the action as party chair Oli’s arbitrary and autocratic act. He said the decision was guided by Oli’s intent to make others unquestioningly accept his acts even as he does just about everything to remain prime minister and enjoy power. “This unjust decision is against communist principles and constitutional right [to expression]. Democratic-minded people will oppose it,” he said.When asked about his next step, Rawal hinted he would launch a new party rather than joining one of the existing ones. “If patriotic Nepalis, honest citizens and political cadres want an organised force to champion their causes, I am ready to join hands,” he told the Post. “However, the structure of such an organisation has yet to be determined.”He said those aspects will be decided based on feedback received from broader consultations. The secretariat meeting also decided to suspend Pandey and Timilsina from their respective responsibilities for six months each, said party leaders.“We were engaged in the party’s work when we learned that leaders have given us a six-month break. We will have to use this time in a productive manner. Looking forward to your suggestions,” Pandey wrote on Facebook, reacting to the party’s decision.Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of the party, reading out the decision to suspend Rawal, said that his statements were against the party line. “As he kept making statements to weaken the party, we decided to remove him from party responsibilities.”All three—Rawal, Pandey and Timilsina—had opposed the party’s decision to build its party headquarters on the land donated by Gurung. The land donation issue landed in the Supreme Court, which later quashed the writ petition after a hearing, paving the way for the UML to proceed with building its new headquarters in Kirtipur, Kathmandu.The party leadership was not satisfied with the clarifications submitted by Pandey and Timilsina and so they have been suspended from, said Gyawali.The meeting also evaluated the performance of the government, he said. “The performance of the government is satisfactory, but the meeting also felt the need to inject some momentum,” said Gyawali. The country’s overall economic condition has improved after the formation of the government, and international relations are also strengthening, said Gyawali. The meeting also endorsed the formation of three mechanisms by the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to discuss amendments to the constitution, craft a unified position on pending bills, as well as to improve governance and service delivery. Each mechanism will have four members from each party. These mechanisms will give suggestions to the government on these key issues, according to ruling party leaders. Moreover, the UML meeting decided to hold the party’s central committee meeting on January 5 and 6.  \nIn June 2022, the Hotel Association Nepal announced a ban on single-use plastics starting January 1, 2025, as part of its commitment to reducing plastic pollution and promoting sustainable tourism. Single-use plastics are designed to be used once and thrown away.As the countdown begins, the initiative looks out of bounds for many hotels, particularly smaller ones, though big ones have already started phasing out single-use plastics.“Most luxury hotels have already implemented the decision,” said Binayak Shah, president of the Hotel Association Nepal, the umbrella body of the hotels and resorts in Nepal. “But for small hotels, whose occupancy is currently only a third of their capacity, it appears difficult.”Replacing plastic with glass bottles or eco-friendly products is expensive, said Shah.Single-use plastics commonly used in hotels include water bottles, straws, cutlery, plates, drink stirrers, expanded polystyrene food service products, toothbrushes, and combs. Nepal has 1,416 hotels, including star-rated and tourist standard establishments, offering a combined daily bed capacity of 54,370.Even in luxury hotels, eliminating plastic water bottles has been a big challenge, according to hoteliers.For example, a seal on a plastic water bottle certified with the NS mark ensures quality.“But no glass water bottles available in Kathmandu come with a seal and NS mark. This has put a question mark on quality assurance,” said Shah. “However, we are in talks with bottling plants. As this can be a big business opportunity, they are responding positively.”“The project may take some time to implement.”The plastic-free initiative, however, could provide a viable business prospect in Nepal, although it may initially be expensive.Bikas Khatri, director of Wave Nepal Pvt Ltd, a Kakani-based exporter of plastic bottled mineral water, said luxury hotels globally have started offering glass-bottled water to prioritise eco-friendly practices that align with modern consumer values.Unlike plastic, glass can be recycled indefinitely without losing quality, supporting a circular economy and helping businesses achieve sustainability goals.“Currently, we are getting orders for refilled water in ‘lock bottles’ from luxury hotels like Aloft, Marriott, and Hilton,” said Khatri. “Due to the high demand, we have ordered 20,000 glass bottles from India to launch the project, which will begin by mid-January.”The glass-bottled water will be distributed like Coke and Pepsi. A quality 500-ml bottle will cost Rs55 without adding transport cost. “So, after factoring in taxes and profit margins, a bottle may cost Rs100,” said Khatri. “This is the cost of the first delivery. By the fourth refill, the cost would be halved.” “It’s a trial. Based on demand, we are also planning to import a refilling machine worth around $35,000,” said Khatri.Most mineral water suppliers in Kathmandu use polycarbonate jars in addition to plastic bottled water.According to estimates, the Kathmandu Valley consumes 100,000 water jars daily. In the peak season or summer, the valley alone uses 30,000 cases (12 bottles each case) of plastic bottled mineral water. A five-star hotel, if fully occupied, consumes nearly Rs200,000 of water per day. Unlike plastic, glass is fully recyclable and can be used multiple times, making it an environmentally responsible choice. By reducing reliance on single-use plastics, restaurants and hotels significantly cut down on waste, contributing to a cleaner planet.Plastic is one of the most important innovations, but single-use plastic products have a severe negative impact on the environment. Plastic is a convenient comfort in today’s world because of its inexpensive production cost and wide range of applications.Single-use plastic products are more likely to end up in rivers than reusable options.Plastic is a non-biodegradable material and most plastic is made from fossil fuels. If burnt, it poisons the air; if buried, it pollutes the soil. And plastic wastes dumped haphazardly have been clogging sewer mains and rivers, and polluting oceans.Nepal still does not have effective waste recycling plants although several private firms have been recycling solid waste and producing compost manure on a small scale.According to an Asian Development Bank report, a waste composition analysis in Nepal indicates that the highest waste fraction is organic matter (66 percent), followed by plastics (12 percent), paper and paper products (9 percent), others (5 percent), and glass (3 percent). Metal, textiles, and rubber and leather each account for 2 percent or less.The most commonly found single-use plastic items in Nepal are plastic drinking bottles, littering rivers and rivulets. With the growing number of climbers, mainly on the world’s highest peak, Mt Everest, plastic waste has infiltrated the Himalayas and polluted freshwater sources.The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) said in its report that Kathmandu alone uses around 4.7 million to 4.8 million plastic bags a day. In Nepal, 16 percent of urban waste consists of plastic, which is 2.7 tonnes of daily plastic garbage production, it said.Besides the sheer quantity of plastic waste being produced, a major problem with plastic is its resistance to degradation, ICIMOD said. A conservative estimate puts the average time for one single plastic bag to completely biodegrade at 500 years, it said.“This means not only that most of the plastic we use during our lives will outlive us, but that our plastic footprint also will affect generations to come.”In April 2015, Nepal declared Kathmandu a polythene bag-free zone. Several other areas have followed suit and declared themselves plastic-free, including Parbat, Myagdi, Damak and Ilam.Plastic bans in urban mountain centres like Gangtok and Nainital in India in the late 1990s have demonstrated that daily life is as comfortable with reduced plastic use, according to ICIMOD.Since January 2020, the Everest region, which has gained notoriety as the “world’s highest garbage dump”, imposed a ban on the use of plastic bags, bottles and other plastic items, citing their adverse effects on human health.The use of plastic bags thinner than 30 microns has also been prohibited.The Everest region has long struggled to manage the solid waste visitors to the region bring along every year.On October 21, the Department of Tourism announced a ban on plastic bottles in four- and five-star deluxe and luxury hotels as a part of its push towards environmental sustainability.  \nDonald Trump is heading back to the Oval Office, defeating Kamala Harris to become the 47th President of the United States. With his return to power, questions arise about how his leadership might affect issues like women’s rights, access to abortion, and LGBTQIA+ advocacy worldwide.The implications for queer rights globally are hard to ignore—especially for countries like Nepal, where international solidarity and funding have propelled LGBTQIA+ advocacy.“If US support dries up, it could create challenges for queer movements worldwide, not just in Nepal,” says Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society, a pioneering LGBTQIA+ rights organisation in Nepal.Her concerns aren’t misplaced. Trump’s first presidency (2017–2021) dismantled key protections for queer communities, setting a troubling precedent.Organisations in the US have already spoken out against Trump’s policies. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a prominent civil rights organisation, released a detailed 10-page analysis of his administration, pledging to mobilise their network to counter these ‘dangerous policies’.During his first presidency, Trump rolled back key protections for LGBTQ+ individuals across multiple sectors, including healthcare, education, employment, and housing.Transgender individuals faced targeted actions, including a ban on serving openly in the military and the removal of LGBTQIA+ content from federal websites. LGBTQIA+ references were removed from a 2020 draft update of USAID policy, and repeated budget cuts to PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) undermined global efforts against HIV/AIDS.Trump’s Project 2025 proposals indicate even more extreme measures in his second term. These include banning gender-affirming care for minors, restricting federal funding for schools teaching ‘gender ideology’, and enforcing a binary gender recognition policy based on sex assigned on birth.Teachers suggesting alternative gender identities could face severe consequences. Transgender individuals could also be barred from participating in sports aligning with their gender identity.Internationally, such actions would expand anti-rights ideologies, as seen with Trump’s 2020 submission of the Geneva Consensus Declaration to the UN, an anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-abortion document.“During his first presidency, Trump removed the US special envoy for LGBTQ+ rights…. while Biden restored it, Trump is likely to do the same again,” says Sunil Babu Pant, a pioneer of the LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal and South Asia’s first openly queer lawmaker. “His stance on banning transgender rights will lead to serious setbacks for queer rights.”Dhakal says, “We stand in solidarity with LGBTQIA+ organisations in the US, Nepali LGBTQIA+ individuals in the US and oppose any action against human rights.”Dhakal’s organisation, Blue Diamond Society, has collaborated with several US-based human rights organisations, including Outright International, Save the Children, and USAID on various projects.Currently, they are running a project focused on HIV service delivery with USAID’s support, and it continues without any interruptions. They have not yet faced any funding issues or prohibitions.They had another project with USAID before Trump’s first term, which also continued with support throughout his presidency. “Trump’s second term begins in January, and while we’re uncertain about what may happen, we remain optimistic,” says Dhakal.While Dhakal hasn’t participated in formal discussions with donor agencies or international queer rights coalitions yet, informal talks regarding Trump’s administration have taken place during review meetings.“Strong financial support helps sustain momentum, expand visibility, and reach more people,” says Sarita KC, the executive director of Mitini Nepal. “This doesn’t mean that queer advocacy in Nepal will come to a halt without US support.”According to KC, Nepal’s queer advocacy has not been entirely dependent on US funding but rather benefited from their solidarity. International conferences hosted by US organisations, she says, have provided platforms for activists worldwide to collaborate and devise solutions. “If such conferences and their associated activities diminish, we will adapt and find new ways,” KC says. “Virtual meetings could be an alternative.”Mitini Nepal has not directly accessed USAID funds but has received support from some US-based international donors. While there have been discussions about potential funding challenges from donors, KC says that support from other countries, including the UK, Germany, and Finland, has started to grow. She believes this could counterbalance any reductions in US support.“I don’t think USAID, which considers human rights one of its core pillars, will pull out support for queer rights completely,” Dhakal says. “The agency would likely continue its support, either directly or indirectly.”While Obama and Biden’s administrations supported LGBTQIA+ rights, Trump’s stance is different. Given the US’s global influence, its policies will ripple across South Asia. Pant says that Trump’s anti-LGBTQIA+ policies and provocative remarks will embolden conservative and religious groups in South Asia, including Nepal.The effect has already been seen.Two months ago, a new political party Aamul Paribartan Nagarik Party in Nepal introduced an agenda aligning with Trump’s election anti-abortion and anti-queer campaign stance and did a protest rally in Maitighar opposing homosexuality, gender transition, and abortion.Recently, KC from Mitini Nepal attended the Equal Rights Coalition conference in Berlin, Germany on December 17 and 18 where discussions centred around the rise of global anti-gender and anti-queer movements. Speculations were raised about Trump’s campaign being a driving force behind these movements. “In Nepal and neighbouring countries, anti-queer sentiments are gaining momentum,” KC says. “Such agendas are likely encouraged by external powers promoting anti-queer rhetoric.”Pant, who is also the executive director of Mayako Pahichan Nepal, adds that activism should not rely solely on foreign donors. “We should become stronger within our nation with government support,” he says.According to Pant, Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ movement began in a challenging era and has seen worse. “While it’s a concern worth discussing, we shouldn’t be overly frightened by foreign shocks,” he adds. “Nepal’s constitution and laws won’t change overnight just because of Trump’s words.”Dhakal, too, thinks that Nepal, as a sovereign nation, should not be swayed by potential US policy changes under Trump. “Nepal has its own constitution and judicial support for LGBTQIA+ rights,” she says. “We shouldn’t adopt negative practices, even from powerful nations.”Dhakal, who is also a founding member of the Asia-Pacific Transgender Network and board member of the International Reference Group on Transgender Women and HIV/AIDS (IRGT), says that their advocacy will continue no matter what. “We in South Asia will join forces with international human rights and queer rights organisations to support queer rights in the US and worldwide,” Dhakal says.“Nepal should speak in international forums and conventions against anti-queer activities. If Nepal remains progressive, it can set an example,” Dhakal adds. “Even a global power can learn from small nations.” \nThe Ministry of Health and Population said that a decision on whether to lower the iodine content in salt will be taken only after a micronutrient status survey, which will start in May next year.The nationwide survey to be carried out after 10 years, with the financial support of USAID and technical support of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be completed in 2026.“The decision to lower the iodine content in salt will be taken only after assessing the level of iodine in the urine of children and pregnant women,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We hope the new report of the micronutrient survey will help us make appropriate decisions.”Iodine is a mineral found naturally in seafood and plants that grow in areas near the sea. In places where iodine is naturally rare, it needs to be artificially introduced into the diet via fortified food products.The Salt Trading Corporation, the agency responsible for importing and distributing salt in Nepal, fortifies iodine at 50 ppm (parts per million) per kilogram of salt, which is higher than the recommended dosage. The World Health Organisation, however, recommends iodine concentration at 15 to 40 ppm per kg. Only 40 ppm of iodine per kilogramme of salt is fortified for India, as it is assumed that the Indian population does not need as much iodine as the Nepali people, since they also get iodine content from foods produced near the ocean.Health experts in Nepal have blamed the excessive amounts of iodine content in salt for the rise in non-communicable diseases, including hypothyroidism.Several studies—including the 2016 Nepal National Micronutrient Status Survey jointly carried out by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, the US-based Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Ministry of Health and Population—found that Nepalis consume excessive amounts of iodine, which has resulted in high prevalence of hyperthyroidism, a condition when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones.The survey showed that more than two-thirds—68 percent—of the population across the country is consuming iodine far in excess of the recommended levels.According to the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factors: Steps Survey-2019, 5.6 percent of the adults (6.5 percent of women and 4.6 percent of men) reported adding salt often or always to food right before or while eating.Additionally, 19.5 percent of the adults (18.1 percent of the women and 21.1 percent of men) reported consuming processed foods that are often or always high in salt.Doctors in Nepal suspect that the high iodine content in the salt being sold in Nepal could be among the reasons for the high prevalence of several non-communicable diseases, including thyroid disorders and hypertension.A change in dietary patterns and an increased consumption of processed foods (including packaged soups) have resulted in an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, they added.Earlier, the government had sent a team of experts to salt factories in India’s Gujarat state to study the iodine fortification process and the possibility of lowering the iodine content in salt. The expert team furnished its report, but the concerned authorities could not decide on the reduction of iodine level in salt.“We have decided to wait further until the report of the planned survey comes,” said Thapa. “The report will help us analyse what changes have happened in the last 10 years and make appropriate decisions.”In 1993, Nepal mandated that salt be fortified with iodine to prevent health problems caused by iodine deficiency, as salt is both cheap and used round the year.Officials said the higher iodine level was mandated for Nepal under the assumption that transport and storage times were longer at the time as the salt had to be carried on the backs of men and animals and some amount of iodine would dissipate by the time the salt reached markets, mainly in the remote parts of the country.However, with roads reaching almost all corners of the country, transportation time has significantly decreased, so there is no need for such a high level of iodine in salt, say doctors.The World Health Organisation recommends less than two grams of sodium or five grams of salt per day for adults to reduce blood pressure, and cut the risks of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. \nLocal pro Niraj Tamang carded a bogey-free 8-under 62 in the first round of the Surya Nepal Eastern Open, the third event under Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, at the par-70 Dharan Golf Club on Wednesday.Tamang carded a new course record with the help of six birdies and sank an eagle to make a flying start on his home course, opening up a four-stroke lead over Dhana Bahadur Thapa, who carded a 4-under 66. Bhuwan Kumar Rokka is third after he carded 3-under 67, while Yuvaraj Bhujel, Bishnu Prasad Sharma and amateur Sunder Rai are tied for fourth at 2-under 68.Top pro Bhuvan Nagarkoti, local pro Bal Bhadra Rai and amateur Jitendra Rai share seventh position at 1-under 69. Ramesh Adhikari, who had a hole-in-one on hole number eight, is tied with Rame Magar, Sunil KC, Rabi Khadka and amateur Suresh Tamang in the 10th position at 1-over 71.Leader Tamang carded 4-under 32 on the front nine with the help of birdies on the third, fifth, sixth and ninth holes. He then sank an eagle on the 12th hole and carded birdies on the 15th and 18th holes to finish the back nine at 4-under 30.Thapa took the turn at 2-under 34 after he dropped a shot on the second hole and carded birdies on the third, eighth and ninth holes. The Army Club pro carded 2-under 32 on the back nine. He faced a bogey on the 13th hole against birdies on the 12th, 16th and 18th holes.Rokka carded 2-under 34 on the front nine and played 1-under 33 on the back nine. He began the day with a bogey on the first hole before carding birdies on the third, seventh and ninth holes. After taking the turn, Rokka carded birdies on the 15th and 18th holes and faced a bogey on the 17th hole. A total of 29 professional golfers and 27 amateurs are participating in the event organised by the PGA Nepal under the sponsorship of Surya Nepal Pvt Ltd. Cut will be applied after 36 holes and top 21 pros and amateurs making the pro cut will advance to the final round. The event carries a cash purse of Rs882,000. The champion will take home Rs150,000, while the runner-up will receive Rs100,000. The third-place golfer will earn Rs75,000. The top 21 pros will secure a share of the prize money.The Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25 features a total of eight tournaments, offering a combined prize pool of Rs6.732 million for the season. \nIn a secretariat meeting of the ruling CPN-UML held on Wednesday, Prime Minister and party chairman KP Sharma Oli briefed secretariat members on the political situation after the formation of the coalition with the Nepali Congress, the government's effectiveness and weaknesses, and his China visit in the first week of December, among other issues.Immediately after Oli's briefing, the secretariat members also expressed their views on the latest situation, said a UML secretariat member. The secretariat meeting also discussed the agenda of the central committee meeting which would be held on January 5 and 6.The secretariat meeting stressed the need for giving momentum to the government by expediting service delivery. The meeting also suggested reforms to make the government's functioning more effective, according to the secretariat member.An eight-member task force formed by the Congress and the UML on November 6 to strengthen ties between two parties decided to form a six-member committee to work on the issue.The Congress has appointed Semanta Dahal, Arun Paudel, and Pratap Paudel as members to suggest on service delivery. In contrast, former chief secretary of the government Lila Gadtaula and senior advocates Kedar Koirala and Rajendra Ghimire were appointed by the UML. “The prime minister's office will be our secretariat, and we are assigned to start our work from Thursday,” a service delivery task force member said. “The main job of the task force is to give policy advice to minimise hassle related to service delivery.” The task force formed to strengthen the two-party relations has Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, and Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba from the Congress. UML senior vice-chair Ishwor Pokharel, vice-chair and Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, and political adviser to the prime minister and Deputy General Secretary Bishnu Rimal are the party’s members.Congress vice-chair Khadka said that during the task force meeting, they discussed ways to address the issue of amending the constitution and other pertinent matters. “The two parties have formally entered the agenda of amending the constitution and are considering forming a mechanism for the same shortly,” Khadka said. Amending the constitution was a key promise of the seven-point agreement signed between Nepal’s two largest political parties, the Congress and the UML, in early July while forming the government led by Oli. The two parties' meeting on Tuesday, which lasted almost three hours, also discussed potential candidates to lead the constitutional amendment process. Likewise, the two ruling parties have formed a separate task force to speed up the passage of bills through Parliament.Every party has parliamentary leaders, chief whip and whip in Parliament who look after issues related to the bill, Khadka said. “Besides, we also have various committees in Parliament for the same.” \nWith the ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—starting the groundwork for the review and amendment of the constitution, the debate over the whole process is heating up. The ruling forces have rightly taken the initiative to implement the pledge they made while forming the coalition government over five months ago. They justified the ‘unusual coalition’ of two largest political parties saying it was the ‘only way’ the constitution could be amended.The seven-point agreement between the Congress and the UML in July stated that the KP Sharma Oli-led government would give priority to making amendments to the constitution and formulating laws that ensure political stability by evaluating the strengths, weaknesses and the complexities witnessed during the course of its implementation in the past nine years.A constitution should be a living document and flexibility on amendments and upgrades undoubtedly help with its sustainability. The constitution of India is often cited as an example in this regard. Promulgated by the Constituent Assembly of India in November 1949, the Indian constitution has been amended 106 times thus far. Likewise, many other democratic countries have succeeded in protecting their constitutions for long. The United States has been implementing the same one for the past 236 years.But in the past seven and half decades, Nepal has already produced and implemented seven constitutions. As the debate on review and amendment of the current constitution picks up, the statute will complete just a decade in September 2025. So there are a few vital things Nepali politicians and constitutional experts need to keep in mind. It is vital to address the concerns and grievances of various political, social and other actors. But as important is to ensure that while addressing the demands of all and sundry, the foundations of the charter are not undermined. Another major point the Congress-UML alliance vowed in the seven-point deal is to deliver political stability. Without constitutional stability, political forces can’t give political and policy stability. Though it’s not easy to garner the two-thirds majority required for constitutional amendment, the opposition parties have not ruled out their support for such a process. But they do appear wary of the prospect of the ruling alliance trying to bulldoze the process. If the ruling parties indeed try to forcibly push through such changes—for instance with the intent of obliterating small political parties—it would be a disaster. It will then make Nepali polity less rather than more stable. The country has been facing various challenges in implementing the statute due to the failure to accommodate various political forces right at the start, when the charter was being finalised in 2015. The new initiative shouldn’t end up opening old wounds. For that, all political forces and stakeholders should be taken on board at every step of the new process. That is the only way to ensure the charter’s sustainability and to make it work as well. Once the process starts and a body is entrusted with reviewing the statute, the demands raised by various groups and agendas put forth by different factions within the major parties will gradually take shape and the debate will enter a formal stage. Done prudently from the start, it can help make the national charter a potent document that can guide the country for a long-long time. Get it wrong, and the country could have to pay for it for perhaps even longer.  \nArtificial intelligence is the product of an unbounded craving for automation. Since the beginning of human civilisation, we have been inventing new machines and technologies to reduce our physical and mental efforts to accomplish tasks. The fascination with automatic intelligent thinking machines that can function as human brains have shaped the narratives of different eras of human history, coloured the imagination of scientists of different epochs and constructed the plots of science fiction. According to reports, those scientists and philosophers who described the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols were the first to plant the seeds of AI. The invention of programmable digital computers in the 1940s and the use of mathematical reasoning in their functioning made some scientists hopeful towards building electronic brains. For this purpose, AI research was founded at a workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956, where John McCarthy, an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist, introduced the term “artificial intelligence”.After countless experiments and many failures, scientists have created several forms of AI for different objectives. However, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in writing or composition has ignited widespread debate over their legitimacy, morality and suitability. Since its inception on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT’s use has drawn the attention of many theorists and scholars of writing pedagogy as it is now regarded as a thinking machine that can generate human-like texts. This intelligent machine can change traditional pedagogical practices by transforming the writing process, including students’ approach towards writing assignments. Some theorists think that these tools can negatively affect the writing process, while others believe that they can be used as reliable tools to move to different stages of the writing process. Positive uses of AI These days, student writers have access to various AI tools with diverse functions that help them go through different stages of the writing process. Grammarly is an editing tool that checks grammar, spelling, punctuation and style and gives required suggestions for further improvements. Quillbot can be used for paraphrasing; Snazzy AI for content creation; Sribbr Plagiarism Checker for detecting intellectual theft and ensuring originality. Among these tools, ChatGPT is regarded as the smartest and most powerful electronic thinking brain due to its ability to navigate corpus texts and produce human-like texts. Undoubtedly, AI’s prudent and creative application can assist student writers in the writing process, to which even pundits of composition pedagogy agree. For example, Generative AI manipulates the process of machine learning to generate results from the existing online corpus data by detecting recurring patterns. Gen AIs like ChatGPT can instantly work on user prompts and create desired texts. Even in academic settings, the likelihood of using diverse writing-related AI tools by students cannot be denied. This means that the future of writing or composition will be shaped by the invasion of AIs into these territories. So, we must use AIs creatively, honestly and wisely in education to maintain academic aura and integrity. This can bring opportunities for positive changes in education, particularly in teachers’ and students’ academic performance in writing and other activities. Negative impacts Despite the merits of AI in the writing process, they are not without flaws. The latest version of ChatGPT, which has become more powerful and creative in generating diverse texts, has made compositionists anxious about its consequences. They believe such tools may cause adverse effects on the overall writing process. They have detected serious flaws in AI-generated writing and are also concerned about the future of teaching writing and the possible misuse of AI by student writers. Opponents of AI have pointed out some drawbacks to the unrestricted and unchecked use of writing tools. First, AI tools lack the human creativity or cognition to differentiate bad content from good ones. There are also issues pertinent to the violation of copyright and plagiarism in writing. Moreover, large language models have been encoded in linguistic patterns of the so-called dominant language, English, which may give birth to a new form of colonialism and undermine the spirit of social justice for which minorities have been fighting for generations. The concept of linguistic inclusiveness in composition pedagogy and translanguaging (how bilinguals and multilinguals utilise their language skills to understand and engage with their environment) will likely be affected. Additionally, AI lacks humans’ crystallised intelligence/knowledge, contextual understanding and syntactical innovation and cannot be involved in meaning-making. Furthermore, AI cannot detect biases and discriminatory content found in their source data. AI-generated texts can cross all the boundaries of propriety, linguistic justice and social inclusiveness by creating unreadable and unacceptable texts. These contents are also just imitations, which can be repetitive and factually incorrect. In short, AI cannot work independently in expected ways. Human intervention and creativity are required to check them constantly. To bridge the divided perspectives and achieve a balance, student writers need to mitigate the negative aspects of AI-generated texts to save their composition, ingenuity and authenticity. They should use these tools as one relies on co-authors to assist with pre-and post-writing activities such as idea generation, editing and proofreading. Students should understand that depending entirely on AI will not be beneficial in the long run. After all, these tools aren’t independent thinkers and cannot replace our originality and empirical knowledge. \nAfter more than seven decades of independence, Indian politics finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with complex issues that challenge its foundational ideals. While it may be misleading to draw direct parallels with neighbouring Bangladesh, the invocation of Dr BR Ambedkar the iconic architect of the Indian Constitution into contemporary debates as recently happened in the Upper House of Parliament highlights a significant conundrum.This reference reflects not only our un-statesmanlike attitude but also our uncharitable attitude towards a stalwart who championed the rights of the underprivileged during an era when nationalist politics largely marginalised him. Even today, discussions surrounding the thinker qua activist Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar evoke multiple discourses, positioning him in a metaphorical rehearsal room of history, awaiting an authentic assessment by future generations. His legacy serves as both a reminder and a challenge to current political narratives, urging us to confront the undue turns that politics takes for its own benefits. In reflecting on Professor Khilnani’s profound observation that Indian history is often portrayed as a “curiously unpeopled place”, we are morally bound to consider the essential contributions of its founding fathers.The question arises—can we envision India without acknowledging figures such as Kabir, Phule, Birsa Munda, Periyar, and Ambedkar? These individuals form the bedrock of the Indian Constitution and embody the multicultural essence of our society. Their legacies are steeped in a relentless struggle for justice and equality, which resonates through an immeasurable saga of sacrifice. Therefore, modern India cannot be understood solely through the glossy lenses of Yoga, discussions in well decorated seminar rooms on the ‘civilisation state’, or grand narratives of economic growth.Instead, it is crucial to recognise how the enduring thoughts and philosophies of these thinkers awakened the dormant masses from antiquity and shaped the identity of today’s Indian republic. Today, when we examine India, it is clear that its path to freedom was not a sudden midnight epiphany but rather a gradual evolution shaped by influential figures like Ambedkar. His contributions are inseparable from the annals of modern Indian history, as he dedicated his life to navigating the country towards radical experiments in social justice. Ambedkar’s polemics resonate with those of critical thinkers in that it boldly posed volleys of perturbing questions and thus challenged the entrenched system of caste/cultural hegemony, positioning himself against the mainstream currents of Indian nationalism.His efforts laid the groundwork for a more equitable society, highlighting the complexities and struggles inherent in India’s perennial quest for true freedom. The Indian state’s political actions, often driven by elite centralisation, clash with Ambedkar’s ideals, which diverge significantly from the narratives of major political entities like the Congress Party or current majoritarian frameworks. Ambedkar embodies a challenge to these dominant discourses, advocating for true democracy and genuine welfare for marginalised groups, including Adivasis. In contrast, the prevailing political logic tends to accommodate these communities not out of a benign commitment to democratic principles but rather as a means to construct a cohesive national entity capable of generating economic surplus. This approach prioritises the construction of political stability to strengthen the state over authentic democratic engagement and inclusivity in India’s diverse multicultural landscape. Even today, it appears that the elites are making concerted efforts to promote new discourses aimed at unifying India, particularly at a time when achieving a cohesive national identity seems increasingly challenging. The political landscape is heavily influenced by the narrative of “one nation, one election,” which seeks to streamline governance and enhance national unity. However, this push for a singular identity must be viewed through the lens of India’s multicultural society, which complicates the realisation of such a grand elitist vision.In this context, it is essential to critically examine and reflect on the cultural dimensions of our diverse populace. Many regions and sections experience psychological unease regarding the overarching project of transforming various social groups into a modern citizenry that would be loyal and acquiescent to the state. This necessitates a deeper understanding of how identity symbolism interacts with the lived realities of different communities across India. Thus, we understand that Ambedkar is no longer merely a protestant icon against the scourge of untouchability; today, his spirit gets amplified and becomes the pivotal embodiment as the key ideologue of social justice. His thought serves as a formidable barrier against the evolving challenges posed by the Indian state, particularly its attempts to undermine accountability amidst a crisis-ridden capitalism that threatens to stifle substantive democracy.This situation risks rendering the state increasingly authoritarian in a Hegelian sense. Consequently, any reference to Ambedkar must be approached with sensitivity, or else a murky climate of thought or similar veiled attempts might ultimately be self-defeating, if not condescending to India’s vast multitude of unequal citizens, hence undemocratic and unparliamentary.-The Statesman (India) / ANN \nNepal is ahead of many countries in LGBTQIA+ rights and policies. The Constitution of Nepal recognises gender and sexual minorities, which even developed countries like the US don’t explicitly mention. Moreover, the judiciary’s support for the rights of the queer community has increased in recent years. While these achievements seem noteworthy at the outset, there is still a huge disparity between the laws and the reality queer people face every day. In Nepal, while much of the activism for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community still focuses on something as basic as identity and legal recognition, issues like the sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) of these communities remain overlooked. Although the Constitution of Nepal ensures fundamental rights, such as reproductive rights under the Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health Act (2018) for gender and sexual minorities, these provisions haven’t effectively catered to the sexual and reproductive health of these communities.The discrimination and stigma that gender and sexual minorities face daily manifests in their general inaccessibility of fundamental rights in Nepal. Programmes related to SRHR are usually associated with cisgender women and ignore LGBTQIA+ individuals. Queer folks are judged and ridiculed not just by their family members but also by the health staff at hospitals and health posts. This is problematic in a country where transgender people are forced to undergo surgery for medical verification to be legally recognised as “male” or “female”. Gender-affirming surgery requires medical professionals to follow certain clinical protocols; however, the existing law does not address gender reassignment. In August, the Supreme Court made landmark progress in recognising LGBTQIA+ rights by ruling that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, must be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without requiring medical verification; however, the law for legal recognition remains the same for all. So, these individuals have no option but to travel to India for surgeries, which can be expensive and unsafe. Moreover, transgender men, lesbians and bisexual individuals often struggle to access basic menstrual hygiene products and healthcare facilities related to safe motherhood and abortion. The path to having and parenting children is fraught with difficulties for queer individuals, as IVF and adoption facilities aren’t accessible. While surrogacy is legal for infertile married Nepali couples, it is prohibited for singles, transgender couples and foreign nationals.Many people have the misconception that only cisgender women menstruate, but anyone with a uterus can experience it. These narratives arise through the limited awareness of our society and restrictive school curriculums. Such a perpetuation of false ideas further influences dominant ideas in popular platforms. Rarely do we see people from the LGBTQIA+ communities in the advertisements of sanitary pads or contraceptives. These communities often receive attention only during Pride Month (June), but progress in SRHR and other issues requires ongoing efforts, not just a month of focus.The legal recognition of same-sex marriage between Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung in 2023 made many hopeful about the future of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ individuals. Conversations about the potential of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ tourism (rainbow tourism) have emerged since. To ensure its sustainability, we must prioritise fundamentals such as SRHR for the queer communities to create a safe space for them. For our economy to benefit from their participation, it must ensure that their primary needs are met with dignity.Our leaders cannot dismiss the issues of queer people by relying on the superficial claims of LGBTQIA+ policy advancements. Yes, there has been progress, but it is not enough. Lawmakers must understand that queer rights go beyond sexuality and identity and include all aspects of human rights, such as the right to sexual and reproductive health. Laws can only go so far if we do not change our deeply rooted beliefs and accept people for who they are while providing essential services. \nSouth Korea’s Constitutional Court will hold its first hearing on Friday in the case of President Yoon Suk Yeol, after parliament impeached him over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3.Here are key issues for South Korea’s road ahead.WHAT NEXT?After being impeached on Dec. 14, Yoon’s presidential powers are suspended but he remains in office, retaining his immunity from most charges except for insurrection or treason. Yoon-appointed Prime Minister Han Duck-soo is acting president.The Constitutional Court must decide within 180 days whether to remove Yoon from office or reject the impeachment and restore his powers. If the court removes Yoon or he resigns, a presidential election must be held within 60 days.The court is due to hold its first preparatory hearing on Friday.Opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Jung Chung-rae, the head of parliament’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee, is leading the case for removing Yoon.Yoon’s legal counsel has not yet been announced, but his background as a prosecutor has sparked reports that he is turning to former colleagues or could even represent himself.Kim Hong-il, a former prosecutor and former head of the broadcasting regulator under Yoon, as well as former Constitutional Court spokesperson Bae Bo-yoon, are expected to join Yoon’s legal teams in the impeachment review and in criminal investigations, local media has reported.IMPEDIMENTS TO A COURT RULING?Under South Korea’s constitution, six justices must agree in order to oust an impeached president. The nine-member Constitutional Court now has three vacancies, so the current justices would have to vote unanimously to remove Yoon.The Constitutional Court has said that it can deliberate and hear arguments with just six justices.The three vacancies are allotted for parliament to fill. The main opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, is seeking to fill the vacancies.Parliament held a hearing for two potential nominees on Monday, which the ruling People Power Party boycotted, saying that acting president Han does not have the right to appoint Constitutional Court justices.There is precedent for an acting president appointing a Constitutional Court justice, as occurred when former President Park Geun-hye was impeached in 2016-2017.WHAT HAPPENS IN COURT?In South Korea’s only previous presidential removal by impeachment, the court took three months to oust Park in 2017.This time, the terms of two court justices expire in April, and legal experts predict the court may seek to rule before then to minimise uncertainty.In the past, academics say, Constitutional Court justices have not voted predictably by political leaning but have decided case by case, based on their interpretation of the constitution.Conservative attempts to rally popular support for Yoon are not expected to affect the court’s ruling, as Park was removed from office despite continued conservative rallies to keep her in power, warring with candlelight rallies to remove her from power.In the case of Park, who like Yoon was from a centre-right party, the court voted unanimously to remove her, including some justices viewed as conservative and two Park appointees.Yoon also faces criminal investigations related to the martial law decision.If charged, he could ask the Constitutional Court to suspend the 180-day clock on the impeachment ruling. The court denied a similar request in Park’s case.In 2004, then-President Roh Moo-hyun, from a centre-left party, was impeached on the charge of failing to maintain political neutrality as required of a high public official.The court rejected the motion after about two months, and Roh fulfilled his five-year term. \nBombardment by Pakistani military aircraft in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province on Tuesday killed at least 46 people, most of whom were children and women, the Afghan Taliban said, adding it would retaliate.Six people were also injured in the bombing at four locations in Afghanistan, deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said on Wednesday.Pakistani government and military officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Afghanistan’s foreign office said it had summoned Pakistan’s head of mission in Kabul to deliver a formal protest note to Islamabad on the bombing by Pakistani military aircraft, warning the diplomat of consequences of such actions.“Afghanistan considers this brutal act a blatant violation of all international principles and an obvious act of aggression,” Enayatullah Khowrazmi, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defence, said in a statement. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered.”A Pakistani official with knowledge of the matter, but declining to be named, told Reuters Pakistan had carried out airstrikes against a camp of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) Islamist militant group.TTP pledges allegiance to, and gets its name from the Afghan Taliban, but is not directly a part of the group that rules Afghanistan. Its stated aim is to impose Islamic religious law in Pakistan, as the Taliban has done in Afghanistan.A major TTP attack in Pakistan’s South Waziristan area, which borders the location of the alleged camp targeted in Afghanistan, killed 16 Pakistani security personnel on Saturday.Afghanistan’s defence ministry identified those killed in Pakistan’s bombardment as “mostly Waziristani refugees” - indicating that they were from Pakistan’s Waziristan territory.The neighbours have a strained relationship, with Pakistan saying that several TTP attacks that have occurred in its country have been launched from Afghan soil - a charge the Afghan Taliban denies.Their relationship was complicated in March when the Taliban accused Pakistan of carrying out two airstrikes on its territory, killing five women and children.Pakistan said at the time it had conducted “intelligence-based anti-terrorist operations” in Afghanistan but did not specify the nature of the operations. \nRishi Handa is an educator and researcher specialising in South Asian and Punjab studies with a PhD from SOAS University of London. He currently heads the Sanskrit and Religious Studies departments at St James Senior Boys’ School, England, also teaching Mathematics and Ancient Greek.In addition to his academic work, Handa is a musician who co-founded the band ‘Flute That Groove’ and performed with artists like Anup Jalota, an Indian singer known for his contributions to the Bhajan genre of Indian music. He is fluent in several languages, including Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, English, and Sanskrit, combining his skills in education, music, and cultural exchange.In this chat with the Post’s Aarya Chand, Handa discusses his career, blending education, cultural studies, and music while reflecting on his academic and creative experiences.As the Head of Sanskrit at a British school, how do you approach teaching this ancient language to students who might not have a cultural or historical connection to it?I use an unconventional approach, focusing on neuroscience and psychology, to make Sanskrit learning enjoyable. I introduce letters through puzzles and crosswords. To make vocabulary engaging, I incorporate hip-hop beats. I teach grammar tables vertically to help students see patterns, making it easy for them to understand the logic rather than just memorising it.The challenges include helping neurodiverse students who may struggle with memorisation or pronunciation. I guide them step-by-step through sound mechanics for pronunciation.Teaching Sanskrit alongside Latin and Ancient Greek, highlighting their structural similarities, creates opportunities for cognitive development. It trains the brain to think in a systematic and logical process.You have a rich academic background spanning both philosophy and mathematics. How do you think these two fields complement each other?Philosophy and mathematics complement each other in promoting critical thinking by focusing on logic and reasoning. Philosophy encourages students to explore the ‘why’, question assumptions, and analyse arguments, while mathematics emphasises the ‘how’ through structured problem-solving. As a teacher of both, I use my background in mathematics to clarify reasoning in philosophy and connect abstract mathematical concepts to more general guidelines. Together, these fields develop creative and logical thinking, giving students a strong foundation for critical thinking and intellectual growth.Your band, ‘Flute That Groove’, blends Indian classical instruments with contemporary sounds. How do you see music contributing to cultural preservation and bridging cultural divides, particularly in a globalised world?Music contributes to cultural preservation and bridges cultural divides. People interested in world music may be drawn to a particular genre, like Western folk fans who appreciate Indian classical music. While Indian classical music has a bit of an acquired taste and is not for everyone, fusion music, like what we do, blends Indian and Western instruments. This allows us to play Indian songs in a Western-style or put an Indian twist on English songs.Music unites people by blending different cultural elements, creating something that resonates with a broader range of listeners.How do you view the role of multilingualism in enhancing cultural understanding and academic research?Understanding each other’s languages is the gateway to understanding a culture. Language defines a culture, and without it, the culture is lost. Every language has a unique way of expressing ideas, and there is no perfect one-to-one translation between them. For example, in English, we prefer the active voice, such as ‘the man eats the apple,’ but Sanskrit typically favours the passive, like ‘the apple is eaten by the man.’This reflects a different way of thinking. In Sanskrit, the focus is more on the object than the subject. This aligns with philosophies like Vedanta, where one sees oneself as the instrument rather than the doer.Moreover, certain words don't have direct translations. Words like ‘Vishwas’, ‘Nishtha’, and ‘Shraddha’ are often translated as ‘faith’, but each carries its unique connotation in the Indian context. Understanding such nuances is essential.One’s understanding is limited and filtered without knowing a culture's language. I’ve seen how knowing the original language, like Greek for the Bible, can change everything. During a debate, I remember someone using Greek insights to shift the whole perspective, showing how language deepens cultural understanding.What was your most memorable experience in Nepal? Did you find similarities between the cultural or religious practices and your studies of South Asian traditions?My experience in Nepal has been insightful. One of my most memorable moments was discovering the connection between the practices here and my research on the Udasi tradition, which is rooted in Guru Nanak’s teachings. Before arriving in Nepal, I felt unsure because I had no prior knowledge or frame of reference for the country. Unlike India, which was somewhat familiar to me, Nepal was entirely unfamiliar. However, people assured me of the country’s warm and friendly nature, and their words turned out to be true. The culture here feels grounded, and the people are calm, which I find refreshing. I’ve also been struck by the lack of anger or aggression. Even when navigating through crowds, there’s a sense of calmness. Something special happened when I visited a local area in Kathmandu and stumbled upon a Udasi Ashram, which was a perfect, unexpected connection to my academic research. The discovery felt like a stroke of serendipity. As I wandered down an unassuming alley, I heard verses from the Guru Granth Sahib streaming through a window. I hadn't expected to encounter such a place during my visit to Nepal, which made it all the more meaningful given my studies of South Asian and Punjabi traditions.With a diverse professional background that includes teaching, music, and filmmaking, what inspires you to keep exploring new avenues? Are there any upcoming projects or ideas you are particularly excited about?I’ve always been passionate about exploring new ideas, and my background in teaching, music, and filmmaking reflects my curiosity and willingness to blend disciplines. Learning and growing continue to drive me, as each experience adds a layer to my understanding of the world. As for upcoming projects, I am excited to develop an app that teaches Indian languages, including Sanskrit, in an easy and accessible way. I aim to help preserve and promote these languages, particularly among the Western diaspora, where many people have become disconnected from their language roots.My method is based on neuroscience and psychology, which makes language learning more intuitive and effortless. I dream of making learning languages like Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, and Punjabi accessible to all ages. The app will be designed in such a way that after just a few hours, someone will be able to start reading newspapers in these languages. I’m also considering including spoken Sanskrit courses, as there is significant interest from those who wish to reconnect with their roots but find traditional methods too tricky. Creating this accessible learning space excites me, and I look forward to seeing how it evolves.Rishi Handa’s book recommendationsI Am ThatAuthor: Nisargadatta MaharajPublisher: Chetana PublishingYear: 1973In this book, an illiterate cigarette seller from Mumbai offers conversations on spirituality, self-realisation, and the nature of existence.Guru Granth SahibAuthor: Compiled by Guru Arjan Dev (and others)Publisher: Sikh religious authoritiesYear: 1604This is a sacred scripture of the Sikh faith.

As of now, hilly regions are partly to generally cloudy, while the rest of the country remains partly cloudy to mostly clear. Some areas of the Tarai are covered with fog or mist. This afternoon, hilly areas of Gandaki and Koshi provinces are expected to have partly cloudy to mainly clear skies, with mostly clear weather predicted for the rest of the country. Tonight, hilly regions of Sudurpaschim, Karnali, Lumbini, and Gandaki provinces will experience partly to generally cloudy skies, while other areas will remain mostly clear. Light snowfall is expected in one or two high-altitude locations in Gandaki Province. \nSeveral provinces, including Sudurpaschim, Karnali, Lumbini, and Gandaki, will witness light to moderate rainfall starting Friday night as moisture-laden westerly wind enters the country from the Mediterranean Sea.The Kathmandu valley will also witness light rainfall on Saturday due to the western disturbances, the Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology said.“Sudurpaschim and Karnali Province will witness light to moderate rainfall. Lumbini, Gandaki Province, will receive light rain,” said Saroj Pudasaini, a meteorologist at the division. “Hilly and mountainous areas of Gandaki Province will witness snowfall.”Meteorologists say that the western disturbance is a phenomenon that affects the weather patterns of the Indian subcontinent, including Nepal. It is a low-pressure system that originates in the Mediterranean region and moves eastward.“Western parts of the country will be affected much, and the weather system will become weak when it moves eastward,” said Binod Pokhrel, an associate professor at the Central Department of Hydrology and Meteorology. “Even if rain does not occur in the eastern part, the day will remain cloudy on Saturday.”The rain is expected to bring relief from rising air pollution. Met officials say the temperature will decline further due to the rain. Kathmandu Valley witnessed scattered rainfall on Tuesday evening, but due to cloudy conditions, the minimum temperature did not fall much on Wednesday morning.According to the Met Office, the minimum temperature of the Valley was recorded 6.7 degrees Celsius on Wednesday morning.The weather will improve from Sunday. \nNepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has declared Karnali Development Bank, a Class ‘B’ licensed financial institution, as a “troubled institution” and assumed its management. The decision was made during a board meeting on Wednesday, citing financial irregularities and governance issues.As per Section 86(B) of the Nepal Rastra Bank Act 2002, NRB has formed a three-member management team led by Deputy Director Tikaram Khatri from the Bank and Financial Institution Regulation Department. Other members include Deputy Directors Bishnu Kumar Bishwakarma from the Financial Institution Supervision Department and Jugal Kishore Kushwaha from the Legal Department. The team will assume responsibility for the bank effective from December 26.NRB spokesperson Ramu Paudel stated that the management team has been granted authority under prevailing laws to exercise the duties and rights of the bank’s board and special general assembly. The team’s mandate includes prioritising deposit repayments, recovering loans, assessing assets and liabilities, and investigating financial irregularities for legal action.The central bank clarified that Karnali Development Bank failed to maintain the minimum capital adequacy ratio, exhibited weak institutional governance, and struggled to meet deposit repayment obligations due to liquidity issues. Additionally, with a non-performing loan ratio of 40.85 percent, the bank’s financial health has deteriorated significantly.NRB has further highlighted that continuing the institution’s operations in its current state would jeopardise depositor interests and erode trust in the banking system. Consequently, the move to declare the institution troubled was necessary to safeguard public interests, the central bank has said.The financial institution had already been subjected to Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) under NRB’s regulations effective November 26. This measure aimed to enforce reforms, but the bank’s worsening condition necessitated stronger intervention.The management team’s immediate focus will be to protect depositor funds and ensure the institution’s obligations are met, alongside conducting a detailed due diligence audit. The central bank said it remains committed to taking legal action against those responsible for the financial misconduct uncovered during investigations. \nAn Embraer (EMBR3.SA), passenger plane flying from Azerbaijan to Russia crashed near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan on Wednesday with 62 passengers and five crew on board, Kazakh authorities announced, saying that 27 people had survived.Unverified video of the crash showed the plane, which was operated by Azerbaijan Airlines, bursting into flames as it hit the ground and thick black smoke then rising. Bloodied and bruised passengers could be seen stumbling from a piece of the fuselage that had remained intact.The Central Asian country’s emergencies ministry said in a statement that fire services had put out the blaze and that the survivors, including three children, were being treated at a nearby hospital.Azerbaijan Airlines said the Embraer 190 aircraft, with flight number J2-8243, had been flying from Baku to Grozny, the capital of Russia’s Chechnya, but had been forced to make an emergency landing approximately 3 km (1.8 miles) from the Kazakh city of Aktau.Russian news agencies said the plane had been rerouted due to fog in Grozny.Authorities in Kazakhstan said they had begun looking into different possible versions of what had happened, including a technical problem, Russia’s Interfax news agency reported.Russia’s aviation watchdog said in a statement that preliminary information suggested the pilot had decided to make an emergency landing after a bird strike.Following the crash, Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, was returning home from Russia where he had been due to attend a summit on Wednesday, Russia’s RIA news agency reported.Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, expressed his condolences in a statement and said those being treated in hospital were in an extremely serious condition and that he and others would pray for their rapid recovery. \n\nThe issue of banning helicopter sightseeing tours in one of the world’s most iconic natural regions, home to the planet’s tallest mountain, from January 1, has turned nasty.As state bodies at all levels, including the local government, are staking their unflinching claim to the skies over the Everest region, serious questions have been raised about Nepal’s high-end tourism prospects. Experts say such a jurisdiction issue may spill over to other national parks if this issue is not handled well. The federal government, however, has not taken the matter seriously.On December 12, the Sagarmatha National Park, which houses the world’s tallest peak, issued directives restricting commercial choppers from flying over it. On December 13, the civil aviation regulator responded that the park has no legal ground to enforce such a ban.After three days, on Monday, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, the local federal unit, issued a strongly worded statement against commercial chopper operations in the Everest region.“We request the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal and all travel agencies operating within this rural municipality to refrain from booking or selling any packages that include helicopter flights for the Khumbu region,” according to the statement. “If any individual or agency engages in such activities after this notice, and if it causes any obstacles or issues in this region, the rural municipality will not be held accountable. This press release has been issued to inform all concerned parties.”The municipality added: “Beyond Lukla, only rescue and sling flights that comply with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be allowed. All other commercial helicopter flights will be banned entirely from January 1.”As per the rural municipality directive, a recommendation must be obtained from the health institution at the flight site for emergency rescues. A health professional must be present on the flight. If further treatment outside the region is required, patients must undergo a test at Pasanglhamu Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla and get a mandatory recommendation from the hospital. “Henceforth, only rescue and sling flights in compliance with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be permitted beyond Lukla,” the municipal statement reads.The statement comes in response to one by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, which vowed not to follow the rules imposed by the national park and asked the helicopter companies to continue with their regular flights. The immediate concern raised by the park is severe noise pollution caused by frequent helicopter flights over the area. The noise disturbs animals, which rely on the park’s relatively undisturbed natural environment. Excess noise can interfere with their feeding, breeding, and other behaviours.The national park has tasked the Nepal Army and local youth groups with monitoring the ban, a development chopper operators see as a serious security concern.“The noise generated by choppers is alarming,” said Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality. “Every day, it feels like the loud noise will blow your ears out.”On November 13, the rural municipality held a discussion inviting ten lawmakers from the upper house of parliament in the Khumbu region. The programme had to be abandoned due to excessive noise of choppers. “Most complaints are from schools. The noise has affected the studies of children.”Every day, the rural municipality receives hordes of complaints from locals about noise pollution. “We do not oppose flights, but the helicopter companies are adamant about not obeying rules. They land anywhere they wish,” said Bhusal. According to the rural municipality, most helicopters are yet to pay the Rs200,000 annual “business tax” imposed by the local government. The park, which covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district, was established on July 19, 1976. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural surroundings and unique culture, it was put on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.The national park said noise pollution in the wildlife habitat has resulted in behavioural changes in animals.The sounds can cause wild animals to leave their habitats and run into the villages. The park authority said accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising. The shy natural goral is found foraging and sheltering on rocky faces of mountains.The animals jump off the cliffs in shock when choppers fly at low altitudes with big sounds. Their deaths are rising. The park authority said they had done justice to the wild animals by stopping commercial flights above the national park.Tourism ministry officials said they are aware of the issue. “We have been discussing the matter with the forest ministry,” said Ram Krishna Lamichhane, spokesperson for the tourism ministry. “We hope the issue will be sorted out soon.”The tourism fraternity warned that the Everest sightseeing ban could harm Nepal’s tourism, which is still struggling to recover to pre-Covid levels. The park is also a major tourist attraction, especially for trekking to the Everest base camp.The Everest sightseeing tour, which falls into an expensive, high-end tourism segment, is a lifelong dream of many people around the world. \nSamara endured six months of harassment from a relative of her late husband before a court interim order demanded her harasser leave her alone. In this period of inaction from the court, Samara (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) fell into depression and attempted suicide, feeling trapped and hopeless. “There is late justice, and these victims are still being victimised,” Samara’s legal counsel told the Post. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” Women in Nepal seeking justice for domestic violence or property partition wait years—often more than five and sometimes upwards of ten years—for the court to resolve their cases and fully implement the decision. The delays in case processing come at a cost to the women, who endure more harassment, financial strain, and loss of contact with their children as they wait for the justice system to take action. In the past year, the court has established a family bench in six of the 77 district courts in Nepal to hear women’s cases more quickly. The bench aims to give female plaintiffs faster decisions in cases related to family relations, alimony, domestic violence, and property division. The family bench, however, does not see a woman’s case when it also includes a legal matter outside of the purview of the bench, nor does the court see divorce cases as Nepali law mandates a one-year waiting period for divorce cases when one of the parties does not agree to the divorce. Since its filing, the main trial court has heard Samara’s case as it is tied to a property division case in which her late husband’s relative is the plaintiff. Samara’s interim order from the court has brought her some peace. Since the order two years ago, her harasser has stopped coming to her workplace demanding the property holdings of her late husband. “After she got the interim order, she believed in herself more,” Samara’s legal counsel said. “Before, she didn’t believe in court, she thought she would not get justice.” Samara’s legal counsel anticipates that the case will take at least another two and a half years at the district court, and may continue longer at the Supreme Court level if one of the parties chooses to appeal the decision. “She doesn’t feel protected,” the legal counsel said. Even when a woman’s case goes to the family bench, procedural hurdles can still delay the verdict, particularly when the case involves property division. Edha’s (who the Post is also identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) domestic violence and property division case is in its fourth year at the Kathmandu District Court. One of her hearings was with one of the three judges appointed to preside over the family bench. She had an arranged marriage more than 20 years ago, and soon after she gave birth to her first child. “After I got married, the abuse was non-stop,” she said. “It was quite brutal.”During her marriage, her husband, who continuously had relationships with other women, left her with serious injuries in bouts of violence, and pressured her to abort multiple pregnancies, though she did later have a second child as the pregnancy was too advanced to abort. Edha didn’t tell anyone about the abuse for most of her marriage. “If you’re going through something bad, if nobody comes to know, then it’s okay,” she said. “My fear was, if people find out, what will they think?”This fear of judgment stopped Edha from taking legal action for years. “In Nepal, if your husband hits you, that means it’s your fault,” she said. “With that kind of stigma, at times, I would just blame myself.” During the pandemic, Edha’s husband told her he wanted a divorce, and became more physically abusive. She decided to leave the house and move to a different home, though she felt hesitant about having to leave her children. “When he told me to get out of the house, and when he started hitting me, I thought I cannot survive in the house,” she said. “It was really difficult for me to leave. I feared I wouldn’t be able to take care of my children.”Edha hopes she will soon have her final hearing, which has been delayed because the court required further documentation. Edha fears seeing her abuser again at the hearing. “That fear is still within me,” she said. “I don’t want to look at that man.”After years of living alone, Edha feels most devastated by the loss of time with her children. She hopes her case will result in her being able to stay where she currently lives and have parental visitation rights. “They told me, within three months, this will be over,” she said between tears. “But it’s the fourth year running, and my kids are far away. I have missed the moments with them.” Edha feels stuck, with no other option than waiting for justice. “I don’t have any faith in the justice system of Nepal—no faith at all,” she said. According to domestic violence victims and their lawyers, when a male defendant has connections to judges or enough money to offer bribes, getting justice can be near impossible. Manika Khadka is a criminal lawyer working with the Women’s Foundation Nepal, and has seen dozens of women’s cases. “In some cases, he [the defendant] is so powerful and they use unnecessary power—that’s why we cannot get justice.”Neesa (also a pseudonym) filed a property division case against her husband nearly a decade ago and shortly after a domestic violence case. Male members of her family had for years violently abused her. Her cases have faced continuous delays, she claims, because of her husband’s bribes and connections to court officials. “You can go and register your case in the court, but then if corruption is involved… court procedures can be manipulated to cause delays,” she said. The Supreme Court has already issued a verdict in Neesa’s favor on the domestic violence case, ordering the defendant to pay both interim relief and a fine. The court, however, has failed to implement the decision.According to Neesa, because of bribes from her husband, officials in the implementation division of the district court have intentionally not enforced the Supreme Court’s verdict to make the defendant pay interim relief to the victim. Instead, the implementation division gave an order that would allow the defendant to avoid payment—a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s ruling. Neesa has no choice but to go back through the court system again, asking for the Supreme Court’s decision to be enforced. Her property case is still ongoing, and each step of the process takes months, she said. “There is a delay at every step of the process,” Neesa said. “The court officials don’t do their jobs efficiently.” Neesa feels frustrated with how long her cases have taken, and the amount of time, money and energy they have required from her. “It is a nightmare,” she said. “These delays and obstacles are attempts to make the plaintiff give up—women rarely have the resources to fight these cases for years and years.” “I can’t plan my life, I’m stuck,” she said. “It’s years of my life I won’t get back.” Samara, Edha, and Neesa each are equipped with legal counsel and have current cases pending, but, as Neesa reflected, innumerable women endure abuse in silence, particularly after they see other women endure long delays in the court cases. “I am educated and can stand up for myself and this is how I am treated, imagine the women who are uneducated,” Neesa said. “If [the court procedure] was simple and it was fair a lot more women would go through it and get justice,” she said.   \nSeven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said. \n\n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nExperts have recommended introducing a mandatory “cooling-off period” for retired civil servants before they can assume constitutional positions or other government roles. The suggestion was made during deliberations on the Federal Civil Service Bill, currently under review in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House of Representatives.Former chief secretary Bimal Koirala argued for the inclusion of a cooling-off period in the bill, stating that the lack of such provisions has turned constitutional commissions into ‘resting places’ for retired bureaucrats. “Why can’t we find qualified individuals from universities or other sectors for these positions?” he questioned during Tuesday’s meeting.Former chairperson of the Public Service Commission, Umesh Mainali, also seconded Koirala, suggesting a three-year cooling-off period. He highlighted the importance of ensuring that such appointments do not compromise the integrity of the civil service.Koirala further emphasised the need for parliamentarians to remain unaffected by interest groups and pressure tactics while drafting civil service legislation. “If we succumb to external influences while formulating civil service laws, how can we claim to be building a nation?” he said.The experts also criticised the proposed bill for being a mere replication of older laws, failing to reflect the spirit of federalism. Koirala pointed out that the centralised mindset is still dominant, with little effort to decentralise authority in line with the federal structure.Former Constituent Assembly member and administrator Janakraj Joshi suggested that civil service laws should prioritise public accountability and competence. He advocated for transparency in bureaucrats’ assets and proposed stricter measures against those holding green cards or permanent residency in a foreign country.Mainali criticised the draft bill for focusing more on employee benefits than on improving service delivery. “The bill should have emphasised public accountability and effective coordination between the administration and leadership,” he said, suggesting the inclusion of a dedicated chapter on responsibilities.Mainali termed the clause allowing the federal government to assign provincial secretaries a regressive provision and argued that such decisions undermine federal principles. He called for amendments to ensure provinces retain autonomy in appointing their secretaries.Experts also emphasised the need for predictable transfer and promotion policies, suggesting that the authority to manage such processes be delegated to the Public Service Commission. They further proposed maintaining the retirement age at 60 and setting entry age limits at 35 for men and 40 for women.  \nThe National Assembly chair, deputy chair, lawmakers and other officials from the federal parliament came together at an event in Kathmandu on Tuesday to discuss the current state of implementation of federalism in the country and ways to strengthen the federal system, which has been practiced in Nepal since 2017.National Assembly Chairman Narayan Prasad Dahal said that there were some mistakes in the course of practicing the newly adopted system. “Many have expected better delivery, economic prosperity and social justice, among other things, in the federal system,” Dahal said while addressing the interaction titled ‘Federalism, National Assembly and the tasks ahead’ jointly organised by the National Assembly and Federalism and Localisation Centre in Kathmandu on Tuesday. “Honestly speaking, there have been some shortcomings.”Bimala Ghimire, vice-chair of the Assembly, said that the upper house should play more role in strengthening the provincial and local levels.Former lawmaker Khim Lal Devkota, who is also chairman of the Centre, showcased a presentation on the issues raised in the seven provincial assemblies. Assembly Secretary Surendra Aryal explained the practices implemented by the Assembly and plans ahead.Parliamentary party leaders Narayankaji Shrestha of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Beduram Bhusal of CPN (Unified Socialist), and general secretary of the parliament secretariat Padam Prasad Pandey, among other officials, also spoke about strengthening the federal system.Lawmakers representing various provinces and dozens of other lawmakers and experts working in the field brainstormed about ways to strengthen the federal system, particularly the provinces. \nThe ruling coalition of the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML are finalizing mechanisms to amend the constitution, with the goal of addressing implementation difficulties and promoting political stability.\nDespite efforts by Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and former minister Pradeep Gyawali, Prime Minister KP Oli's anticipated India visit remains uncertain, as New Delhi has yet to extend an invitation, and his previous trip to China may have caused uneasiness.\nRabi Lamichhane, president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, suspended as lawmaker due to money laundering, cooperative fraud, and organized crime charges; party appoints acting president in his absence.\nFrom Saturday to Monday night, three individuals (Kul Prasad Acharya, Prabin Acharya, and Nayan Gurung) were murdered in Kathmandu Valley for various reasons, including depression and personal grievances.\nMilan Acharya turned himself into police on Tuesday, confessing to murdering his father and brother in their Balkot residence on Monday; the victims had injuries below their ears and police recovered a stone grinder and dumbbell at the scene.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City to begin on-the-spot random vehicle emission testing, imposing fines for exceeding permissible levels.\nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nThis year’s ‘Ncell Woman ICON ICT Award’ has been conferred to Bandana Sharma, who has been recognised for her significant contributions to the field of information technology. She recently received this prestigious award at the Grand Finale of the ICT Award 2024.Chief Minister of Karnali Province, Yamlal Kadel, and Ncell’s Corporate Communications and CSR Head, Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, jointly presented the ‘Ncell Woman ICON ICT Award 2024’ to Sharma. Currently serving as the Head of the Cards and Digital Banking Division at Nepal Bank, Sharma also received a cash prize of Rs300,000 along with the award.Every year, this award is presented to a woman who has made remarkable contributions to Nepal’s ICT sector. “We are delighted to continue this collaboration to encourage women in ICT and recognise their contributions,” said Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, Head of Corporate Communications and CSR at Ncell.Sharma began her career as an IT Support Officer at Nepal Bank in 2006. She has been instrumental in the bank’s digital transformation, contributing to core banking systems, network security, cybersecurity, and the development of customer-friendly digital services and infrastructure. \nFarmer Ratan Rawat of Chandannath Municipality, Jumla, diversified his farming from traditional paddy cultivation to cash crops like apples and vegetables.He initially used to cultivate paddy only. Rawat is now reducing the paddy cultivation area and increasing the area for apples and vegetables.“I used to transplant paddy on my 10 katthas of land. But for the last four years, I have been cultivating apples and vegetables,” he said. His paddy acreage has now been reduced to six katthas.Most of the farmers in the municipality, engaged in paddy farming, have now switched to cash crops.Khadak Budha, another farmer from the same village, has reduced the paddy field by half. He said he used to produce 30 sacks of paddy until a few years ago, but his output declined to 15 sacks.With the good income from apples and vegetables, Budha reduced the paddy acreage.“Apple is in demand,” said Rawat. Though he had no intention to cut on paddy cultivation, as apple farming started generating good income, he gradually switched to apple production.In the highlands of mid-western Nepal, commercial vegetable and apple farming thrived after paddy started to yield little income and there was a shortage of farmhands. The rise in disease also forced people to switch to cash crops from cereal production.“Vegetable farming generates better income than growing paddy. That’s why farmers shifted to vegetable farming,” said Rawat.Farmers have focused on the production of vegetable seeds as well.Compared to last year, paddy production has declined in Karnali this year. In the current fiscal year, 123,795 tonnes of paddy was produced on 39,763 hectares compared to 124,969 tonnes in the last fiscal year.In Karnali Province, paddy is mainly produced in Surkhet, Salyan, Dailekh and West Rukum. Jajarkot, Jumla, and Kalikot are also some areas where paddy is cultivated.The highest elevation at 3,050 metres is Chhumjul of Jumla, a record altitude where rice is cultivated in Nepal.According to the Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives, Surkhet produced 52,904 tonnes of paddy, more than the sum of Dailekh’s 25,120 tonnes and Salyan’s 23,630 tonnes. According to the statistics for the past five years, paddy production in Karnali has been continuously declining. In the fiscal year 2019-20, paddy output in Karnali was 151,805 tonnes, which dropped to 137,165 tonnes in 2020-21. The output dropped to 125, 143 tonnes in 2021-22 and rose slightly to 128,000 tonnes in 2022-23. Out of 299,339 hectares of arable land in Karnali, farming is done on 216,880 hectares. Paddy covers 45,468 hectares.According to the statistics, paddy in Surkhet covers 12,679 hectares, followed by 8,313 hectares in Dailekh and 7,078 hectares in Salyan. Similarly, in West Rukum, paddy is cultivated on 3,048 hectares, followed by Kalikot with 3,081 hectares and Jajarkot with 3,063 hectares.Purna Bahadur Thapa, the ministry's information officer, said that output and field of paddy both have declined sharply. “The paddy production area has shrunk, mainly in Surkhet, Dailekh, Jajarkot and Salyan.”Paddy production has dropped due to a lack of irrigation. The rainfall damages irrigation canals in the hilly district. “Lack of rainfall was also a problem. If the rainfall gets delayed, it creates difficulties sowing the seeds. As a result, paddy transplantation is not completed on time,” said Thapa. “The delay in paddy transplantation impacts production.”The provincial government data shows that out of the total irrigable land in Karnali, only 35.21 percent is covered by irrigation facilities. The round-the-year irrigation facility is provided only on 38,338 hectares, while 30,302 hectares are partially irrigated.Thapa said that the farmers also face the problem of insufficient seeds. As farmers have applied new hybrid seeds, new diseases have emerged. The increasing urban area also reduced production and farming land. \nLinking the excitement of cricket via Nepal Premiere League (NPL) to the classrooms, Ncell Foundation, as per its commitment, will be providing educational kits to 2,612 students from community schools across Nepal. This impactful initiative of the Ncell Foundation to support the students at community schools is tied to the 653 boundaries hit during the entire season of NPL that concluded on Saturday. “This is a testament to the Foundation's commitment to transforming the excitement of cricket into meaningful educational support for underserved communities wherein the Foundation has committed to allocating four educational kits for every 4s hit during the NPL,” Ncell said in a statement. Each kit to be provided to students will include essential items such as school bags, notebooks, pencils, sharpeners, erasers, and more. “This season’s NPL has been a milestone in nurturing Nepali cricketing talents. We are thrilled to collaborate with NPL, combining the passion for cricket with a cause that provides essential educational resources to needy students. We are committed to working with CAN, all regional teams and other stakeholders to ensure the successful attainment of 2,612 educational kits distribution,” said Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, Head of Corporate Communication and CSR at Ncell. \nNupu Sherpa of Tokpegola, situated around 4,100 meters above sea level in Mikwakhola Rural Municipality in Taplejung, sold 20 yaks in Tibet, China, back in 2019. He earned Rs110,000 per head, as there were no border restrictions on taking yaks to the Chinese market. Sherpa and five other herders in Thudam, Sankhuwasabha, a higher pass known as a centre for yak herding, used to sell yaks by crossing the Chinese border. During the pre-Covid period in 2019, the last time they traded yaks to Tibet, they brought Rs5 million each.But since then, they have not been able to export yaks to Tibet.“While trading in Tibet at that time, the 1 Chinese yuan was equivalent to Rs16,” said Sherpa. “I have heard that the rate has increased, but sadly, we cannot sell yaks anymore.”Sherpa currently owns 75 yaks, and all are mature enough to be sold. Normally, yaks have a life expectancy of 15-20 years, and after that, they turn thin and old. So, the commercial value of yak is at the age of 12.“The old yak does not fetch a good price, so selling them while they are still valuable is important,” said Sherpa. Now, to make ends meet, Sherpa has been making dog chews from yak milk. In the upper reaches, when the market in Tibet was open and vibrant, yaks were used as pack animals. “But now, rearing yaks has become a burden for many people,” said Sherpa.Nearly 180 households like Sherpa’s have the same problem—no market access.According to the Yak Farmers Federation, Taplejung, each family is rearing between five to 400 yaks.Sherpa, also president of the federation, said that their only alternative is to let yaks die. Yak farmers have requested Netra Prasad Sharma, chief district officer, to raise the issue with the officials on the other side of the border. Accordingly, on December 14, a meeting was held between the key officials of Taplejung and Dinggye County in southwest Tibet. “We have raised the issue, including to allow trade of agricultural products. It was the main agenda from our side at the meeting, but Tibet showed reluctance to resolve the issue faced by Nepalis living at the Nepal-China border point,” said Sharma.During the meeting, the Chinese representative said that Beijing would make the decision regarding livestock trade and that they would make requests to the higher authority.“We are hopeful the issue will be addressed,” said Sharma.The border people tried to export yak, milk, dog chew and ghee on different occasions but were returned, said Sharma.Kimathanka in Sankhuwasabha and 13 other trans-Himalayan trade points along the Nepal-China border were reopened in May after four years of closure.In May, then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha reached Tibet through the Kimathanka border point, and Vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Silang Nima jointly opened the traditional trading points amid a function in the Tibetan town of Chentang. They announced the reopening of 14 of the 21 trading points in various districts along Nepal’s mountain range.Chinese authorities closed the border passes in January 2020 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which severely disrupted the livelihoods of Nepalis living in remote mountain villages close to Tibet.“We have raised the issue at Nepal’s home ministry,” said Sharma.The locals who lost one of the crucial markets after Covid-19 were hopeful that the reopening of the border in May for people and trade movements would revive the yak trade.The residents in far-flung northern borders believe that the trade restrictions have also affected Tibet. Mingma Diki of Olangchung Gola said her family would buy yak calves from Tibet, rear them in Nepsl and sell them back to Tibet after they matured.“It’s strange that free trade with Tibet has stopped altogether.”Locals suspected that China might have stopped the yak trade due to lumpy skin disease that spread in Nepal in 2023. The first outbreak of lumpy skin disease in Nepal started in June 2020. By 2023, more than 48,000 cattle have died from the disease that has affected all of the country's 77 districts.More than 3,000 livestock were affected by lumpy skin in Taplejung, according to the Livestock Service Office.Tibet, however, has not officially made any statement about stopping yaks from coming from Nepal.“We submitted a special proposal on this issue, but Beijing declined it,” said Chheten Sherpa Lama, ward chairman of Phaktalung rural municipality, who was in the Nepali delegation with chief district officer Sharma, to Tibet as a translator.The population of yak has been increasing and causing additional burden to farmers, said Lama.“Feeding yaks is becoming increasingly difficult, and fodder shortages are adding to our hardship.”As per the District Livestock Office statistics, there are around 8,000 yaks in Taplejung. The federation said that even if a yak is priced at Rs50,000, Taplejung has yaks worth Rs400 million. Around 60 percent of yaks are at the age to be sold.Locals of the mountain region have been rearing yaks at 3,000 to 5,000 metres as their traditional occupation. They are reared particularly in the higher passes of Sirijunga, Phaktalung, Mikwakhola, Meringden and Phungling.According to the locals, yaks have also become prey to snow leopards, bears and wolves. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to launch a nationwide campaign offering the public free screenings for certain non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, and renal function, among others—in the ongoing fiscal year.The move aims to make people aware of the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, which account for around 80 percent of total deaths, officials say.“As per the instruction of the health minister [Pradip Poudel], we are planning to launch a nationwide campaign to screen for certain non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The campaign will be launched in the month of Falgun (February 13 to March 13).”Non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, liver problems, heart problems, and cervical cancer, among others have emerged as major killers in recent years, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. According to a 2019 study on the prevalence of non-communicable diseases by the Nepal Health Research Council, 71 percent of total deaths at present were due to non-communicable diseases, and an additional eight percent of deaths were linked to injuries. The study was primarily focused on behavioural risk factors like tobacco and alcohol consumption, as well as biological risk factors like high blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid levels, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. Officials hope that free screenings for non-communicable diseases will help raise awareness of risk factors and ultimately help lessen the disease burden.“This campaign aims to make people aware of the emerging risk factors caused by our changing lifestyle, food habits, and stress levels, among other things,” said Ghimire. Officials say that health workers will also organise outreach camps in remote areas where people must walk for hours for health screening.“The main purpose of the free screening campaign of non-communicable diseases is to make people aware of the problems,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Mental Health Section at the division. “The burden of non-communicable diseases has been raised alarmingly of late, and people are seeking care only when the problems worsen.”Early diagnosis and precautionary measures can help stop health problems from becoming serious, doctors say.Public health experts say that it is high time to focus on non-communicable diseases, as their burden has raised alarmingly. As most people do not undergo testing unless there is an emergency, doctors say it may be too late when the symptoms surface. They say that many lives could be saved if testing of non-communicable diseases is made free.Along with free testing, authorities must focus on behavioural changes—improvements in eating habits and physical exercises, among other things.“Countries like ours have been facing a double burden—an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases and the emergence of new vector-borne diseases and other communicable diseases,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Due to excessive use of processed foods, which contain preservatives, people suffer from multiple non-communicable diseases.”Several studies show alarming signs on a number of issues including growing consumption of alcohol, tobacco, salt and junk food, and insufficient intake of vegetables and fruits, which lead to cardiovascular diseases. Doctors say that along with ensuring free screening and treatment, authorities concerned should focus on raising awareness about lifestyle changes and associated risks. \nWith the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, the Ministry of Health and Population has stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Nepal reported the latest case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the disease. Nepal confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year, when a 60-year-old foreign national had tested positive.“We have increased health screenings of passengers entering the country from abroad, as per the instruction of the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Kanchhi Maya Twanju, a health worker deployed at the health desk set up at the Tribhuvan International Airport. “We have been instructed to send passengers having fever and those showing symptoms of mpox infection directly to hospitals.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries. Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases.Along with stepping up screening of the passengers entering the country via TIA, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have alerted dermatologists about the risk of an outbreak of mpox virus in the country and have requested them to refer suspected cases for testing,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We will take additional measures following consultations with stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation’s Nepal representatives.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks since it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases of infection can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions, saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.“We didn’t expect that the infected person would come from Saudi Arabia, as there is no outbreak currently,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “This incident shows that the deadly disease may come from any country, and we must remain vigilant and prepare agencies concerned accordingly.”Doctors say preventing an outbreak of the deadly viral disease is not the sole responsibility of a single health agency, and it is impossible to do so.“Every agency and person, including passengers, should shoulder the responsibility and take preventive measures,” Pun stated.Mpox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.Meanwhile, health officials informed that the condition of the infected man is normal and he will remain in hospital isolation for an additional two weeks.They said that they are also working to trace close contacts between the patients on the plane and the taxi driver who took him to the hospital. \nNepal reported another monkeypox or mpox case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the deadly disease. “Yes, samples of the suspect, who has been admitted to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, have returned positive results,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire. “We collected the samples on Thursday and got a positive report today [Friday].”Health authorities confirmed the first case of monkeypox infection in June last year.A 60-year-old foreign national had then tested positive for the infection.Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries . Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.According to health officials, the infected person, who is a migrant worker, was sent to the Dhapasi-based Grande International Hospital soon after arrival.Doctors at the hospital suspected monkeypox infection, based on the symptoms, and referred the patient to Sukraraj Hospital.“He had rashes in his private parts and blisters on hands and legs,” said a doctor at the hospital, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “The patient admitted to have had sexual contact in Saudi Arabia.”Officials at the EDCD said they will start contact tracing from Saturday.“We have to trace close contacts of the patient on the plane he travelled and the vehicle he used to go to hospitals,” said Ghimire. Public health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Monkeypox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came into widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases. \nNepal’s health authorities are mulling postponing the malaria elimination target to 2030, aligning with the World Health Organisation’s target, after efforts to contain the spread of the disease proved ineffective and it became impossible to declare the country ‘malaria-free’ by the 2026 deadline.What alarmed them most was the isolated indigenous cases that have emerged as a major challenge to eliminating the disease from the country even by 2030.“Isolated indigenous cases of malaria have become a major challenge in containing the spread of the deadly disease,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Single indigenous cases of infection have been reported from several places. We have been struggling to trace the source of infection.”Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes carry these deadly parasites, according to the World Health Organisation. Nepal had initially committed to achieving ‘malaria-free’ status by 2026. For this, the country needs to bring down indigenous cases or local transmission to zero, achieve zero deaths starting from 2023, and maintain zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.However, the country has failed to bring down indigenous cases to zero in both 2023 and 2024.Instead, cases of infections–both Indigenous and imported have risen alarmingly, which shattered any prospects of eliminating the disease within the deadline.Health officials say that only 16 cases of local transmission or indigenous cases were confirmed in 2023. But in 2024, more than 20 cases have been reported. Compared to 649 imported cases in 2023, the country witnessed nearly 1,000 such cases in 2024.Indigenous malaria cases are locally transmitted, meaning the infected person does not have a history of travel to a malaria-affected country. Officials say that the isolated indigenous cases of malaria infection are such cases that they do not have a history of travelling to the disease-endemic areas.“Neither the people of the community and family have been infected, nor the infected persons have a history of travelling to disease-hit areas,” said Dahal. “We have stepped up surveillance measures to trace the source of infection.”Officials attribute that the disease might remain asymptomatic for a long time in the infected person and emerge as single isolated cases or may have been contracted within the country in areas not considered endemic.Officials further added that open borders, budget cuts in the health sector, and mosquitoes moving to higher altitudes due to climate change have hindered Nepal’s malaria elimination goal.They say that of the total imported cases, over 80 percent came from India. Some cases were imported from African countries. Nepali security personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-hit African countries also often get tested positive for malaria.Officials say the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in Nepal unless India eradicates it first. They say that due to proximity, and an open and porous border between Nepal and India and unregulated travel of people of both countries, it is impossible to eliminate malaria in Nepal, until the disease gets eradicated in the southern neighbour.Several other factors, including cuts in the health budgets by government and aid agencies and shifts in vectors transmitting malaria to the hills and mountains due to global warming, also pose serious challenges to meeting the elimination target. Apart from this, most health facilities across the country lack entomologists necessary for conducting surveillance. Malaria-related deaths had stopped since 2016, but five years later, in 2021, the country recorded one death from the disease.Officials at the health ministry said that until recent years, Plasmodium Vivax, a protozoan parasite, had been responsible for most of the malaria cases in the country, which caused relatively less severe diseases. However, cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which most often cause severe and life-threatening malaria, have been rising. The parasite is common in many countries in Africa and the Sahara desert. \nThe holiday season has its rules, from its distinct colour palette to the cold weather. Listen closely, and you can hear the sound of bells jingling with their particular charm.If you are like me, the best thing to do during this time of year is to make yourself cosy in bed, wrap your blanket tightly, and snooze the alarm until the very last minute before being pulled by daily mundane routine.

The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nSouth Africa will field debutant Corbin Bosch in their first test against Pakistan, starting on Boxing Day, as captain Temba Bavuma revealed the line-up on Tuesday.Bosch features in an all-seamer bowling line-up and will be playing on his home ground at Centurion, winning a test cap just days after making his one day international debut on Sunday, hitting 40 not out and taking one wicket as South Africa lost to Pakistan at the Wanderers in Johannesburg.The 30-year-old Bosch joins Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada and Dane Paterson in the home attack, getting an opportunity because of a long injury list that sees Ottneil Baartman, Nandre Burger, Gerald Coetzee, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje and Lizaad Williams all out because of injury or lack of fitness.\"It's one thing making your debut, but then to make it where you've made a name for yourself in the provincial setup is another thing,\" Bavuma said of Bosch at a press conference on Tuesday.\"I think Corbin adds an extra element to our bowling attack, he comes with the extra pace. Obviously, a big, strong guy as well, so one of the guys who can hit the deck hard.\"And he obviously offers a role with the bat as well. We saw in the ODI that he can hold his own with the bat. We're excited for him to see what he can do with the red ball and strengthen our bowling line-up,\" added the South Africa captain.Chasing WinThe all-pace attack means frontline spinner Keshav Maharaj sits out. \"I think it's no different to what we've generally gone with. We back our seamers here in Centurion and nothing has changed,\" Bavuma said.South Africa are chasing a win that would guarantee them a place in next June’s World Test Championship, as they sit top of the standings after winning their last five tests.\"We accept and acknowledge the fact that expectation has risen. There will be pressure that comes with that, but to be honest with you, we’re coming into the series to win the series 2-0, but we understand for us to do that, there's certain things that we need to do as a team.\"Keep things simple, keep doing the small things right and allowing the result to take care of itself,\" he added.South Africa team: Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Temba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Kyle Verreynne (wicketkeeper), Marco Jansen, Corbin Bosch, Kagiso Rabada, Dane Paterson. \nNepali all-rounder Kushal Malla is set to play in the International League T20 (ILT20) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after being signed by the Desert Vipers. The franchise brought Malla on board to replace injured Dutch all-rounder Bas de Leede.Desert Vipers’ Director of Cricket, Tom Moody, expressed confidence in Malla’s abilities, stating, “He is a young player but has already gained significant experience at the highest level.”Malla is currently Nepal’s fifth-highest run-scorer in T20 internationals, amassing 917 runs in 47 matches, including one century and four half-centuries. Notably, he scored an unbeaten 137 runs off 50 balls against Mongolia in the Asian Games, reaching his century in just 34 deliveries. Additionally, he has taken 43 wickets in both ODI and T20 international formats combined and has 768 runs in 39 ODIs.The Desert Vipers, runners-up in the inaugural ILT20 season, are set to face the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the opening match of the 2025 edition. The team boasts an impressive roster, including Alex Hales, Colin Munro, Rohan Mustafa, Wanindu Hasaranga, Sherfane Rutherford, Sheldon Cottrell, Tom Curran, Sam Billings, Luke Wood, Dinesh Chandimal, and Ruben Trumpelmann.The Desert Vipers is a professional Twenty20 franchise cricket team competing in the Emirati International League T20. \nNepal played out a 1-1 draw against Bhutan in a Women’s U-19 international friendly held on Sunday at the Dasharath Stadium.Sushila KC opened the scoring for Nepal with a brilliant strike from outside the penalty area in the 47th minute. However, this goal did not prove decisive, as Bhutan’s Phuntsho Choden equalised in the 80th minute.The match also featured a crucial defensive effort by Nepal’s defender Simran Rai, who made a spectacular goal-line clearance with a header in the 20th minute, denying Bhutan’s Choki Om from scoring. Apart from this, both teams failed to create significant attacking opportunities in the first half.In their previous Women’s U-16 friendly, Bhutan had defeated Nepal 5-1. \nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that Kurdish militants in Syria will either lay down their weapons or “be buried”, amid hostilities between Turkey-backed Syrian fighters and the militants since the fall of Bashar al-Assad this month.Following Assad’s departure, Ankara has repeatedly insisted that the Kurdish YPG militia must disband, asserting that the group has no place in Syria's future. The change in Syria's leadership has left the country's main Kurdish factions on the back foot.“The separatist murderers will either bid farewell to their weapons, or they will be buried in Syrian lands along with their weapons,” Erdogan told lawmakers from his ruling AK Party in parliament.“We will eradicate the terrorist organisation that is trying to weave a wall of blood between us and our Kurdish siblings,” he added.Turkey views the Kurdish YPG militia - the main component of the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militia, which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984.The PKK is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Ankara has repeatedly called on its NATO ally Washington and others to stop supporting the YPG.Earlier, Turkey’s defence ministry said the armed forces had killed 21 YPG-PKK militants in northern Syria and Iraq.In a Reuters interview last week, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi acknowledged the presence of PKK fighters in Syria for the first time, saying they had helped battle Islamic State and would return home if a total ceasefire was agreed with Turkey, a core demand from Ankara.He denied any organisational ties with the PKK.Erdogan also said Turkey would soon open its consulate in Aleppo, and added Ankara expected an increase in traffic at its borders in the summer of next year, as some of the millions of Syrian migrants it hosts begin returning. \nFalling debris from a Ukrainian drone that was shot down caused an explosion and a fatal fire in a shopping centre in the city of Vladikavkaz in Russia's North Ossetia region, the local governor said on Wednesday.Sergei Menyailo, the regional governor, wrote on his official Telegram account that air defence systems had shot down the drone at 0828 Moscow time (0528 GMT).One woman was reported to have been killed inside the shopping centre.Reuters could not verify the governor's assertion and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine.Russia’s Defence Ministry said 119 Ukrainian drones had been destroyed in the last 24 hours. \nThe actions of the Israeli military had a “circumstantial influence” on a decision by Hamas militants to kill six hostages in Gaza in August, according to a military investigation published on Tuesday.The recovery in September of the bodies of six Israeli hostages, including American-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin, triggered deep shock in Israel, prompting half a million people to stage street protests demanding the government enter a hostage deal with Hamas.The six, seized by Palestinian militants during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel, were shot dead 48-72 hours before being found by Israeli forces, according to health ministry estimates.The hostages were killed by their captors, the investigation found, and that the Israeli military’s activity “in the area, although gradual and cautious, had a circumstantial influence” on the militants’ decision to carry out the killings.The military had no prior intelligence about the presence of the six hostages in the area, the investigation found.“The investigation published tonight proves once again that the return of all hostages will only be possible through a deal,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Tuesday.Talks between Israel and Hamas to secure the release of the 100 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza are ongoing.An Israeli negotiation team plans to return to Israel from Qatar on Tuesday evening for “internal consultations” regarding a hostage deal after a significant week of talks about Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nOn December 19, 2024, the veteran communist leader and upper-house parliamentarian Bamdev Gautam caused quite a stir in the Dalit community by suggesting that the word ‘Dalit’ must be removed from official documents, including the constitution and the law. He made a fallacious argument that removing the word Dalit from all written documents would somehow emancipate that community and guarantee their rights.Speaking to the National Assembly’s Development, Economic Affairs and Good Governance, Gautam said, “Let’s remove the term Dalit from our dictionary… On the one hand, we decry discrimination against Dalits and the infringement of their rights; but on the other, our language, acts, constitution, law as well as document written by the scholars all refer to them as Dalits.” No doubt, Dalit has become a controversial term over the years, even within the Dalit community. Social media is full of comments from ordinary people, most of whom are upper castes, where the word is presented as a kind of license to dominate and discriminate against the “untouchables”. And, strangely, some Dalits themselves tend to agree! Especially the younger generation of Dalits, particularly those from the towns and with some opportunities and privileges, harbour a degree of disgust with the word. They think Dalit identity, Dalit quotas and Dalit literature have further exposed them to discrimination. There’s some truth in that, of course, but it’s a mistaken understanding.But this is the first time a senior communist politician—a former deputy prime minister and home minister—has expressed his anger at the Dalit word. How do we understand this attitude of a senior politician towards us? What does he want by attacking Dalit identity, one wonders: True liberation of Dalits or the end of their limited access to power and privilege?A nonsensical argumentGautam’s assertion on removing the word Dalit from legal and official documents and literature apparently for their own sake doesn’t make any sense. There’s no evidence to suggest that simply getting rid of a word automatically liberates the community from traditional oppression. There’s the glaring case of India. The Dalits of this country started using the term Dalit as their self-identification centuries ago. However, the Constitution of independent India, passed by the Constituent Assembly on November 29, 1949, doesn’t refer to any caste or community as a “Dalit”. The untouchables have been constitutionally and legally identified as the “scheduled caste” instead.A question to respected Gautam is: Has the avoidance of the term Dalit from the official lingo in India really contributed to the emancipation of Dalits? Has this policy really stopped the practice of untouchability in society? The answer is, squarely, no!In contrast, the usage of the term Dalit in Nepal is quite recent. The political movements of the “untouchables”, often supported by the Nepali Congress Party and the communist parties, borrowed it from India and started using it in their movements only seven decades ago. But we’ve been subjugated, exploited, separated and humiliated as “untouchables”, following Hindu laws, from centuries ago, well before the unification of Nepal by Prithvi Narayan Shah in the mid-18th century. It’s important to keep in mind, therefore, that the significant section of the Nepali population currently recognised as Dalits have been suppressed and tormented, including through state laws and policies (such as the Muluki Ain of 1854), since long before the use of the term came into use. Is it fair then to lay the entire blame of Dalit suffering on what I would consider an innocent word?Change culture, not literature Nobody would suggest that one word or one form of identity should be established forever. Healthy debates and discussions on any identification must be welcomed and encouraged. It’s a good idea to change communal identity befitting the changing times. But this should happen amongst the concerned groups themselves; upper-caste leaders like Gautam must not intervene.But many of us hold that this is not the time to argue against using the term Dalit. For one thing, unlike humiliating terms like untouchable and water-unusable and low caste and small caste, Dalit identity wasn’t forced upon us by the state or the religion. The state started using this term, instead of the other highly stigmatised terms mentioned above, according to our own needs and demands. Moreover, it’s crazy to think that simply removing the word would remove the stigma of caste and minimise caste hatred against us. It’s not that simple, is it? In this futile exercise, various Dalit groups have adopted new surnames including some resembling the prestigious upper-caste surnames. The Kami and Damai each has more than two hundred family names! A fake family name would provide a degree of cover against caste prejudice in unfamiliar social settings—but that doesn’t, and hasn’t, in any way, liberated anybody from the traditional forms of exclusion and humiliation. We recently met with former prime minister and Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who agreed with our assertion that political changes alone haven’t changed the situation of Dalits on the ground. What is truly required is a separate “cultural revolution” against the caste system. I’ve heard some other senior politicians from across the party spectrum express a similar sentiment. Neither Dahal nor we meant here the cultural revolution conducted by Chairman Mao in China in 1967-76. I’ve long advocated the need for religious and cultural reforms to tackle the entrenched problem of caste discrimination in this country. The key to our success. People often frown at our assertion to conduct religious reform, maintaining that it’s impossible to amend Brahmanism. True, religious texts like Manusmriti can’t be reviewed as easily as a constitution or law. But that doesn’t mean religious traditions and beliefs can’t be corrected according to changing times. Our society has undergone many religious and cultural reforms in recent years. Upper castes no longer require ritual purification after returning from sea voyages. Intercaste marriage is quite common and acceptable, among non-Dalits in particular. Today’s Bahuns are free to drink alcohol, eat with other castes, play drums, run iron workshops and tailoring shops. Society has been far more rigid when it comes to reforming the religion and culture to guarantee the constitutional and legal rights of Dalits. That’s the last push we must all attempt. Despite the strong inertia, the state can reform religious and cultural beliefs and practices, with the aid of modern laws. Dalit freedom fighters must pressure the ruling class to work in that direction. We all want to break the chain of Dalitness. We have no pride in being born a Dalit. It’s an identity that should be dumped in the dustbin of history. But we will only become free from Dalit identity when the rituals and customs get rid of the practice of untouchability.  \nThroughout Nepal’s legal history, juvenile justice has remained a neglected issue. Only after Nepal ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) on September 14, 1990, did the concept of justice for children begin. The commitment also led Nepal to introduce the Children’s Act, 2048 (1992). The Act served as the first-ever legislation related to children and their rights. While it was a landmark step for the security of children, it still fell short of our expectations.The act was weak and outdated with vague provisions and inadequate protections for children who fell into conflict with the law. So, the call for a more comprehensive legal framework grew louder. This demand cultivated an environment for formulating the Act Relating to Children 2018, which strengthened Nepal’s juvenile justice framework. However, despite the advancements, challenges remain as the law fails to bridge the gap between law and practice.Under the fourth subsection of Provision 43 in the 2018 Act, it is stipulated that “when a juvenile offender reaches the age of eighteen while still serving their sentence, they aren’t to be transferred to an adult prison, but rather to a special facility”. A special facility for those transitioning from juvenile centres to adult prisons was attempted, but it didn’t materialise, likely due to logistical challenges. As a result, juveniles as young as 12 years are housed alongside individuals nearing 30. This practice alone has been overcrowding juvenile facilities. When supported by a weakly enforced law, this system blatantly contradicts the CRC, which prohibits the housing of juvenile convicts with adult convicts.Earlier this year, in conversation with the director of the Underprivileged Children’s Educational Programme (UCEP)—an organisation advocating for child rights—I discovered that all eight of Nepal’s juvenile detention centres have a combined capacity of just 390. But more than 1,300 delinquents are kept in these facilities, which creates severe overcrowding.The effects of overcrowded facilities extend beyond logistical challenges. They also leave a harmful mark on the psychological, intellectual and moral development of the juveniles. Undoubtedly, an individual’s growth is heavily influenced by their surroundings. The young mind is malleable, and when put in an environment far from conducive, the chances of them adopting harmful behaviours are sky-high. The recent incidents in Nepal’s juvenile centres highlight a serious dysfunction. For instance, this July, the Jayandu Juvenile Correction Centre in Banke saw a violent delinquent-led outburst, marking a third such incident of its kind in just 12 months. These clashes, which resulted in deaths and numerous injuries, accentuate the need to address the systemic flaws in our judicial system. However, when discussing the issue, it is equally crucial to note that the roots of these problems don’t just lie in our flawed legal system. They are deeply connected with the socioeconomic realities of incarcerated children.From my interview with the UCEP, I found that 95 percent of these young delinquents come from struggling, impoverished families. These are children who have never known a life beyond their huts and farming; children who aren’t familiar with financial peace; children who battle to survive each day; children who commit crimes, unaware that it makes them criminals. This is a situation born out of legal illiteracy. The level of legal literacy among the youth in urban centres like Kathmandu itself is weak and the concept is practically foreign in the villages. As a student, I believe that a good part of this shortcoming is a direct reflection of the weakness of our education system. While the government-issued school-level curriculum includes topics related to the constitution and the legal system, the content merely scratches the surface. The coursebooks enlist laws, yet they fail to inform about the consequences of breaking them. Our curriculum omits crucial details about the legal process, like the trial system, juvenile detention centres and what follows the commission of a crime. This superficial approach leaves students with minimal knowledge on our rights and responsibilities, making us vulnerable to unintentional infractions.However, it would be unfair to place the entire blame on the curriculum alone, as society, too, plays a big role in this issue. With limited public discourse on legal rights, provisions and consequences, our society is failing the youth. I’ve witnessed that society often consumes itself with discussions on matters unrelated to our immediate concerns. They fail to devote time and attention to educating the young about the legal system governing them. If we allocate even a fraction of our focus to legal education, especially for the youths, the next generation will be safe from falling into conflict with the law.Ultimately, this failure to provide comprehensive legal education, by both the curriculum and civil society, leaves us with only a shallow understanding of our rights and responsibilities as citizens. This lack of awareness makes us highly vulnerable within the justice system, where ignorance invites consequences. So I ask, why should children bear the title of convict if they are unaware that their normality is a federal offence? Why should they pay the price for the weakness of the government-issued curriculum? It’s about time we shifted our approach. We must establish a society where juveniles can find security in lawmakers and law enforcement officers. Educators must never forget that legal advancements are only effective with proper implementation.  \nA few days ago, I attended a programme related to the Institute of Federalism at Madhesh University. During the event held in Rautahat, some participants questioned me about my stance on universities. They noted that when I was a member of Parliament, I opposed the proliferation of universities in Nepal, yet now I support Madhesh University. Their concern was valid, and I welcomed the opportunity to clarify my position.When I served in the National Assembly, I was the only member who voted against establishing new federal universities. My argument has been based on the constitutional framework. The Constitution of Nepal grants provinces the authority to set up and manage provincial universities. With over a dozen universities already under federal jurisdiction, adding federal universities appears unnecessary. Instead, provinces should lead the creation of universities tailored to their specific needs and provide sufficient justification.However, I have consistently emphasised that the federal government’s role should focus on forming a comprehensive higher education policy and an umbrella act for universities. This would create a clear framework for both federal and provincial governments to work together in expanding higher education. Without such a policy and legislative framework, the uncoordinated establishment of universities could strain resources, duplicate efforts and compromise quality. The federal government allocates funds to universities through the University Grants Commission (UGC), and at the provincial level, funding comes via fiscal transfers. However, if the trend of opening new universities continues, having both federal and provincial institutions compete for UGC grants and redirecting funds away from provinces and local governments to the UGC will undermine the purpose of establishing new universities at either the federal or provincial level.Addressing the broader issue of the Ministry of Education’s budget allocation is crucial to understanding where the federal education budget is spent, how much is retained at the federal level, and how much is allocated to provinces and local governments. This in turn helps us examine the UGC’s role in managing these funds at the federal level. Understanding these dynamics is essential for creating a more effective and equitable education system in Nepal.In the fiscal year 2024-25, the Ministry of Education received Rs203.66 billion, with 28.33 percent (Rs57.70 billion) directed to the federal level, 2.26 percent (Rs4.61 billion) to the provinces and 69.41 percent (Rs141.36 billion) to local levels. Analysing the federal allocation of Rs57.70 billion reveals distinct trends. The UGC leads federal education spending, with its share rising from 23.5 percent in FY 2019-20 to 33.21 percent in FY 2024-25. However, most of this funding is used for operational activities rather than research and innovation. School teacher pensions also comprise a significant portion, accounting for 32.93 percent of the federal budget, limiting investments in infrastructure and innovative programmes.The Central Implementation Unit (CIU), with Rs460 million (7.97 percent), manages major education projects, including externally funded initiatives, but there are concerns about its centralised resource management. The Medical Education Commission (MEC) has seen a notable rise in its allocation, from 1.38 percent to 8.96 percent, reflecting a focus on healthcare workforce development. However, the issue of scholarship recipients often leaving Nepal for better opportunities abroad remains challenging.There has been a slight decrease in budget for programmes such as the Higher Education Promotion Programme (HEPP) and the School Sector Development Programme (SSDP), with overlapping roles between HEPP and UGC causing inefficiencies. The SSDP, later replaced by the School Education Sector Plan (SESP), shifted more funding to provincial and local levels, limiting federal involvement to training, administration and curriculum development. Meanwhile, allocations for the President’s Education Reform Programme (1.52 percent) and the Center for Education and Human Resource Development (CEHRD) (1.47 percent) have been criticised for impractical implementation and centralised budgeting.The President’s Education Reform Programme has bypassed the decision-making authority of local governments. The programme often selects school projects at the federal level, with funds allocated to constituencies linked to influential figures. For instance, in FY 2023-24, Education Minister Devendra Poudel directed a large share of the budget to his home district, Baglung, benefiting 143 schools (Kantipur, March 28, 2024). Similarly, in FY 2024-25, the programme prioritised earthquake-affected schools in Jajarkot and Bajhang. Such practices have raised concerns about equitable resource distribution and the programme’s alignment with decentralised governance principles.The Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT), which manages technical and vocational education, received Rs159.59 million (2.77 percent), indicating slow progress in expanding vocational education. Despite increased funding for coordination units like the Education Development and Coordination Unit, the federal budget prioritises pensions, operational activities and centralised programmes over transformative reforms or addressing systemic gaps. These trends suggest the need to reevaluate federal spending to balance decentralisation goals with efficient resource use and equitable education improvements across all levels.At the provincial level, the FY 2024-25 education budget is Rs4.61 billion (2.26 percent of the total Ministry of Education budget), allocated through a conditional grant from the federal government. The CTEVT dominates provincial allocations, receiving 78.4 percent of the total, highlighting a focus on vocational education and technical training, crucial for developing a skilled workforce. Despite its devolved functions, the National Education Board (NEB) receives only 7.3 percent of the provincial budget, suggesting that its activities remain centrally managed, limiting provincial autonomy.In FY 2024-25, 69.41 percent of Nepal’s Ministry of Education budget—Rs141.36 billion—was allocated to local governments as conditional grants. A large portion of the local education budget, 78.21 percent (Rs. 110.60 billion), is directed toward teacher salaries. This allocation supports community schools comprising 85.1 percent of Nepal’s 27,990 schools. Most of this salary budget (68 percent) is spent on basic-level teachers for Grades 1-5, where 67.3 percent of students are enrolled. While prioritising teacher salaries ensures operational continuity, it restricts the local government’s ability to fund other pressing needs. Globally, decentralisation models advocate for more diversified budget allocation to address broader educational challenges effectively.Programmes like day meal initiatives, which help retain students and address malnutrition, receive only 5.99 percent of the budget (Rs8.47 billion). Free textbook grants, including materials in local languages, account for just 2.7 percent (Rs3.81 billion). These essential programmes suffer from limited funding, particularly in underserved communities.Similarly, funding for infrastructure and educational quality is severely inadequate. Only 1.34 percent of the budget goes to school operation and management grants; performance-based incentives for improving educational outcomes account for just 2.17 percent. Less than 2 percent is allocated to school construction, hindering efforts to modernise and enhance learning environments, particularly in rural areas.The rigid structure of budget allocations under the SESP, with over 91 percent of the budget locked into predefined programmes like salaries, meals, and textbooks, limits local governments’ autonomy to create initiatives tailored to their communities’ specific educational needs. In contrast, international best practices grant local authorities greater decision-making power, enabling them to effectively address diverse and evolving educational demands.Minimal investment in alternative education, digital learning and innovative programmes—each receiving less than 2 percent—also emphasises the need to align local budgets with modern educational goals, such as technology integration, bridging access disparities and fostering innovation. \nNepal’s dairy sector has for long been under financial strain. The cost of milk and milk products has spiked so much that many households have cut down on (or entirely stopped) their consumption. The price of processed milk, which was Rs76 a litre in January 2022, has climbed up to Rs120 a litre. Dairy products from Uttar Pradesh of India that are comparatively cheaper (INR62 or Rs100 a litre) are also smuggled into the country. As a result of reduced demand and steady imports of cheap products, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation now has a stockpile of 600 tonnes of butter and 500 tonnes of powdered milk, and the farmers are yet to get Rs580 million the cash-strapped DDC owes them. Farmers, dismayed by the delays in payment, have often had to take to the streets.In an effort to settle the problem, the DDC has started exploring domestic private as well as international markets. To start with, it has agreed to supply 1,000 kg of raw cheese or whey (used to make chhurpi which is also called hard cheese) to a private company daily, starting December 30. The DDC will need 10,000 litres of milk a day to do so. The company, Himalayan Dog Chew, owned by the Manaram Group, exports chhurpi to the United States. Known as dog chew in the West, chhurpi is quite popular and in high demand among the owners of pooches in the US and Canada. But exporters in Nepal have struggled to meet the demand. So the deal between the private company and the DDC couldn’t have come at a better time. The dairy corporation has, for the first time, collaborated with the private sector to sell its products. But there’s still a lot of work to be done. As reported in Kantipur, the Post’s sister publication, eastern Nepal has a huge potential to export hard cheese, and some small dairy firms and farmers, with their own efforts, are selling these products in India without branding them. If Nepal could brand them and strike multiple such partnerships with more private companies in the countries in its immediate neighborhood, it could be to the benefit of both the DDC and the dairy farmers. Exporting milk products with the help of the private sector could bring relief to the farmers and the broader dairy industry. However, the success of this initiative is contingent on strong coordination between private companies and farmers. To facilitate this, the dairy corporation should establish a clear mechanism to get the milk from the farmers, who are at the start of the supply chain, to the exporters, who are at the end. There should also be a lot more coordination. For instance, while the demand for chhurpi is healthy, the butter that emerges during dog chew production doesn’t get the market. As the DDC is also planning to export butter to Tibet and to the larger Chinese markets, establishing a seamless channel of trade and communication between the farmers, the DDC and the private buyers would be vital. If China agrees to Nepal’s export proposal, experts say that the DDC’s products will not stockpile. With a little more thought put into the process, it could be a win-win prospect for all three sides.   \nThe Maoist party, which joined mainstream politics by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006, has always had a peculiar relation with semantics. In the insurgency days, the top Maoist leaders were not known by their real names but their noms de guerre. Partly, this was done to hide their identity, and partly, it was their way of overcoming individualism and pursuing a larger cause. Thus Pushpa Kamal Dahal became ‘Prachanda’, Baburam Bhattarai ‘Laldhoj’, Barsha Man Pun ‘Ananta’ and so on. The party has itself undergone various name changes to arrive at its current avatar of CPN (Maoist Centre). There are often rumours of the party leaders mulling removing the ‘Maoist’ tag. Despite this seeming flexibility, it must hurt all those involved in the decade-long war when the country’s top court repeatedly rejects their attempts to recognise the janayuddha (‘people’s war’). Most recently, the apex court ruled that it is unconstitutional to use the term in official documents. A year ago, it had rejected the-then Maoist-led government’s efforts to declare a public holiday on ‘People’s War Day’. With their strongest claim to political space—a self-sacrificing war waged for the benefit of the downtrodden and the marginalised communities—legally rejected, the use of violence that took nearly 17,000 lives, and left countless more disabled and ‘disappeared’, will be questioned even more in the days ahead. The Maoists and a section of the intelligentsia continue to talk up the war’s achievements: There would apparently have been no republican federal state without the war. Or a system of reservations for the marginalised communities. (Even this newspaper acknowledges the Maoist role in these developments.) Yet it is as important to factor in the party’s evolution in the post-war years. The causes that the party once held dear—particularly issues of the poorest and most marginalized sections of the society—have repeatedly been sacrificed at the altars of Dahal’s naked quest for power. These days, there is little to choose between the Maoist Centre and the old ‘bourgeois’ parties in the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML that the former rebels once held responsible for all social ills. Times are also changing. Those born in the past three decades have little or no memory of the war. Instead, they have seen how its supposed achievements have been endlessly abused by leaders from across the political spectrum. For these younger folks, the idea of getting political legitimacy through a war waged in the name of Mao—a bloodthirsty dictator from another time and place—just does not sound right. Of late, the CPN (Maoist Centre) party has been making much of its ‘stellar’ showing in the recent bypolls. This, say party leaders, is an indication that their popularity is again on the up. That is unlikely. These small pockets of electoral success aside, indications are that people are highly dissatisfied by the functioning of the Maoist party as well as its chair Dahal. The loss in support among its once core constituencies is particularly alarming. Unless the Maoist leadership is ready to internalise and acknowledge how it has let these constituencies down and to commit to rectifying its mistakes, an electoral comeback looks tough. Unfortunately, for Dahal and his followers, there is no going back to the old-school janayuddha either.   \nLong gone are the smog-free winter days. As soon as the temperatures dip, the bowl-shaped topography of Kathmandu Valley traps pollutants in the atmosphere, making its air one of the most toxic in the world. The problem is not limited to the federal capital and its periphery though, as other cities and districts in the country also fare poorly in this regard. All of Nepal’s 30.7 million people now live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline of 5 micrograms per cubic metre. This has cut the life expectancy of Nepalis by nearly five years, as reported by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) issued by the Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago.Though illegal, the practices of stubble burning in the fields, and open-waste or plastic burning in the backyards of houses, street corners and even public spaces, are widespread. Moreover, construction works on roads and sidewalks that linger for months or years result in much dust and dirt, while contractors often show little urgency to meet the deadlines. Little do people consider that their small part, when extrapolated across a large population, is making the air unbreathable and destroying their health. The systemic neglect of authorities is also exacerbating the air pollution crisis.Breathing in unhealthy air has multiple health consequences. Health workers warn that exposure to foul air can in the short term lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke and heart problems. Over time, it can cause severe conditions such as ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases and heart complications. Since the start of the dry season this year, hospitals in the Valley have witnessed a steady rise in the number of patients—mostly children and elderly—with respiratory illnesses. A recent Nepal Health Research Council study shows that children in Kathmandu Valley are particularly vulnerable to air pollution due to their exposure while commuting to and from schools. In response, the Ministry of Forests and Environment has recently asked people to focus on maintaining their vehicles, using clean energy, controlling smoke and dust coming from roads and construction work, and refraining from burning plastic. But such directives are more often ignored than they are heeded, by both the public and authorities. While sprinkling water on roads and sweeping the dust can keep our surroundings clean, these activities are no solutions to the problem of air pollution. Worryingly, promoting clean energy, including in our kitchens, doesn’t seem to be a priority of our political leaders and authorities. Experts also often point to lack of coordination between different agencies to tackle air pollution. We thus need a complete overhaul of the way we manage air pollution. Lasting solutions will emerge only through greater collaboration, for instance, between the local units, and the ministries of transport, health and population and urban development. Local authorities can control open burning through stringent rules and monitoring; the transport ministry too could get serious about phasing out old vehicles that emit pollutants. While pollution from cities in northern India has also been identified as a contributor to poor air quality in Nepali border towns and the capital city of Kathmandu, perhaps the locally generated pollutants are an even bigger threat. If we fail to do our bit to clean our own air, we also lose the moral ground to point fingers at other countries. With the right policies, programmes and mindset, the air we breathe would be a lot healthier.  \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) was formed in August 2021 by a group of dissident CPN-UML leaders including two former party chiefs and ex-prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal. The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders. We are thinking of concluding this process [of welcoming him] soon.What about Bhim Rawal joining the party?Unhappy with the party leadership, he has been inactive in the UML but he has not made up his mind to join our party.Is finalising Gautam’s hierarchy and role in the party taking time?There won’t be an issue in the case of Bamdev ji. But overall, the number of leaders in our party is big. In the Chinese Communist Party, there are only seven members in the Politburo Standing Committee and 17 members in Other Politburo Members. But there are 24 members in our party’s central secretariat, 41 in the standing committee and 108 members in the politburo. Those who get a candidacy in the election celebrate but those who don’t get a ticket become inactive. Some others fight for ministerial posts. Yet others complain about not getting a ‘lucrative’ ministry. We have to manage them all.What about reunifying the party with the UML or the Maoist Centre? Many say leaders are more comfortable with the Maoist Centre but party cadres are for rejoining the UML.Most of our cadres are from the UML background. That might have played a role. But at present there is no possibility of our reunification with the UML. Also, the situation isn’t right to forge unity with the Maoist Centre.It is said that there is pressure from party members for reunification with the UML?That’s not true. There is a negative view about us in the UML and therefore our party rank and file wouldn’t be ready to surrender. Some might be lobbying for entry into the UML for personal benefits. Even if some join the UML, it won’t be easy for them there.But some noted leaders such as Ram Kumari Jhakri who had strongly supported you in the course of building this party have said that the Unified Socialist can’t run like this and that it is better to merge with the UML?I also enquired about her remarks but she said her intent had been misunderstood. But I repeat that there is no possibility of unity with the UML. We studied the possibility of unity with the Maoist Centre but concluded that we can’t accept Maoism and we also found their election symbol inappropriate. So the process has stopped. For now, we will concentrate on strengthening our own party.How is the Unified Socialist different from the UML?Our’s is a policy-driven party and not leader-centric. Committee system prevails in our organisation, not the leader’s orders. We discard rightist approaches and follow revolutionary ideas. We don’t see these qualities in the UML. Only our party has a policy of ‘Socialism with Nepali Characteristics’. We prioritise our agenda based on justice, fair distribution, production and good governance. There was a period when socialism stressed only on equality and therefore some termed it a distribution of poverty but we believe socialism as a principle of prosperity. Capitalism focuses only on profits even at the cost of people’s lives and wars but socialism values people’s lives and livelihoods. So, we are clearly against capitalism and in favour of socialism. But there are different forms of capitalism. We are for promoting national capitalism and eliminating comprador capitalists. We need to invite and welcome foreign investment to increase production in the country.Your party held its general convention in July first week and it took months to elect other office bearers and assign roles and responsibilities. Why?It shouldn’t have happened. Some wrong elements entered our party. Some showed immaturity by raising the issue of ‘new generation’. That spoiled the situation. Building a party is not easy. It calls for many things including ideological clarity, capacity to lead the organisation efficiently and an accepted personality. We have to learn from this episode and remove the mistrust that cropped up in this course. \nIt has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that western disturbances and a low-pressure system are currently influencing Nepal. Madhesh, Lumbini, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces are experiencing generally cloudy conditions, while other parts of the country have partial to clear skies. Fog and mist were observed in a few locations in the Tarai and the Kathmandu Valley this morning. Light snowfall is expected in some high hilly and Himalayan areas, with fog or mist likely in the Tarai and the Valley during the early hours.   \nWeather in western Nepal has begun to change, with the Sudurpaschim province experiencing cloud cover since Monday evening. The Meteorological Forecasting Division stated that this change will gradually spread across the country. The cloud cover will persist through the afternoon today, with weakening expected from Wednesday. No rainfall has occurred yet, though light rain is possible in some areas and snow in the higher hills and mountains at night and in the morning.The division also noted that the western wind system is currently affecting the country, and a western low-pressure system is influencing Sudurpaschim, Karnali, Lumbini, and Gandaki provinces. Presently, there is cloud cover in the far western region, partial clouding in the hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali provinces, and mostly clear skies in other regions.Over the next 24 hours, light rain is possible in some parts of Bagmati and Madhesh provinces and a few places in Koshi province. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that a moderate influence of westerly winds is currently observed across Nepal. The division said that a westerly low-pressure system is expected to impact Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces from this evening. At present, hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali provinces are experiencing partly cloudy conditions, while the weather remains mostly clear in other regions. Fog and mist are affecting parts of the Tarai and hilly areas. Light rainfall is expected in some areas of Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces. Additionally, light snowfall is likely in parts of the high hills and mountainous regions of Koshi province, and in several locations within the high-altitude areas of Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces. The division has cautioned about foggy conditions in parts of the Tarai and Kathmandu Valley in the morning, which could momentarily impact daily life, health, agriculture, transportation, and aviation. It has urged the public to exercise necessary precautions. \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe CPN-UML has removed its senior leader Bhim Rawal from the party and stripped him of the party’s ordinary membership. The former UML vice chair and former home and defence minister had for long been without any responsibility due to his differences with party chair KP Oli.In the last UML general convention in November 2021, Rawal had contested against Oli for the post of party chairperson but lost. A UML secretariat meeting decided to strip Rawal of his party membership after assessing his series of statements and activities that were against the party’s official line, said a senior UML leader.Rawal had opposed the party’s decision to accept land donated by Min Bahadur Gurung, the owner of Bhatbhateni supermarket, with the intent of building the party’s headquarters. He publicly spoke against the decision to accept the land, citing Gurung’s “controversial” background. Following his statements, the UML sought clarifications from him and two other female leaders—Binda Pandey and Usha Kiran Timilsina. Pandey is a standing committee member while Timilsina is a central committee member.Talking to the Post, Rawal termed the action as party chair Oli’s arbitrary and autocratic act. He said the decision was guided by Oli’s intent to make others unquestioningly accept his acts even as he does just about everything to remain prime minister and enjoy power. “This unjust decision is against communist principles and constitutional right [to expression]. Democratic-minded people will oppose it,” he said.When asked about his next step, Rawal hinted he would launch a new party rather than joining one of the existing ones. “If patriotic Nepalis, honest citizens and political cadres want an organised force to champion their causes, I am ready to join hands,” he told the Post. “However, the structure of such an organisation has yet to be determined.”He said those aspects will be decided based on feedback received from broader consultations. The secretariat meeting also decided to suspend Pandey and Timilsina from their respective responsibilities for six months each, said party leaders.“We were engaged in the party’s work when we learned that leaders have given us a six-month break. We will have to use this time in a productive manner. Looking forward to your suggestions,” Pandey wrote on Facebook, reacting to the party’s decision.Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of the party, reading out the decision to suspend Rawal, said that his statements were against the party line. “As he kept making statements to weaken the party, we decided to remove him from party responsibilities.”All three—Rawal, Pandey and Timilsina—had opposed the party’s decision to build its party headquarters on the land donated by Gurung. The land donation issue landed in the Supreme Court, which later quashed the writ petition after a hearing, paving the way for the UML to proceed with building its new headquarters in Kirtipur, Kathmandu.The party leadership was not satisfied with the clarifications submitted by Pandey and Timilsina and so they have been suspended from, said Gyawali.The meeting also evaluated the performance of the government, he said. “The performance of the government is satisfactory, but the meeting also felt the need to inject some momentum,” said Gyawali. The country’s overall economic condition has improved after the formation of the government, and international relations are also strengthening, said Gyawali. The meeting also endorsed the formation of three mechanisms by the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to discuss amendments to the constitution, craft a unified position on pending bills, as well as to improve governance and service delivery. Each mechanism will have four members from each party. These mechanisms will give suggestions to the government on these key issues, according to ruling party leaders. Moreover, the UML meeting decided to hold the party’s central committee meeting on January 5 and 6.  \nIn June 2022, the Hotel Association Nepal announced a ban on single-use plastics starting January 1, 2025, as part of its commitment to reducing plastic pollution and promoting sustainable tourism. Single-use plastics are designed to be used once and thrown away.As the countdown begins, the initiative looks out of bounds for many hotels, particularly smaller ones, though big ones have already started phasing out single-use plastics.“Most luxury hotels have already implemented the decision,” said Binayak Shah, president of the Hotel Association Nepal, the umbrella body of the hotels and resorts in Nepal. “But for small hotels, whose occupancy is currently only a third of their capacity, it appears difficult.”Replacing plastic with glass bottles or eco-friendly products is expensive, said Shah.Single-use plastics commonly used in hotels include water bottles, straws, cutlery, plates, drink stirrers, expanded polystyrene food service products, toothbrushes, and combs. Nepal has 1,416 hotels, including star-rated and tourist standard establishments, offering a combined daily bed capacity of 54,370.Even in luxury hotels, eliminating plastic water bottles has been a big challenge, according to hoteliers.For example, a seal on a plastic water bottle certified with the NS mark ensures quality.“But no glass water bottles available in Kathmandu come with a seal and NS mark. This has put a question mark on quality assurance,” said Shah. “However, we are in talks with bottling plants. As this can be a big business opportunity, they are responding positively.”“The project may take some time to implement.”The plastic-free initiative, however, could provide a viable business prospect in Nepal, although it may initially be expensive.Bikas Khatri, director of Wave Nepal Pvt Ltd, a Kakani-based exporter of plastic bottled mineral water, said luxury hotels globally have started offering glass-bottled water to prioritise eco-friendly practices that align with modern consumer values.Unlike plastic, glass can be recycled indefinitely without losing quality, supporting a circular economy and helping businesses achieve sustainability goals.“Currently, we are getting orders for refilled water in ‘lock bottles’ from luxury hotels like Aloft, Marriott, and Hilton,” said Khatri. “Due to the high demand, we have ordered 20,000 glass bottles from India to launch the project, which will begin by mid-January.”The glass-bottled water will be distributed like Coke and Pepsi. A quality 500-ml bottle will cost Rs55 without adding transport cost. “So, after factoring in taxes and profit margins, a bottle may cost Rs100,” said Khatri. “This is the cost of the first delivery. By the fourth refill, the cost would be halved.” “It’s a trial. Based on demand, we are also planning to import a refilling machine worth around $35,000,” said Khatri.Most mineral water suppliers in Kathmandu use polycarbonate jars in addition to plastic bottled water.According to estimates, the Kathmandu Valley consumes 100,000 water jars daily. In the peak season or summer, the valley alone uses 30,000 cases (12 bottles each case) of plastic bottled mineral water. A five-star hotel, if fully occupied, consumes nearly Rs200,000 of water per day. Unlike plastic, glass is fully recyclable and can be used multiple times, making it an environmentally responsible choice. By reducing reliance on single-use plastics, restaurants and hotels significantly cut down on waste, contributing to a cleaner planet.Plastic is one of the most important innovations, but single-use plastic products have a severe negative impact on the environment. Plastic is a convenient comfort in today’s world because of its inexpensive production cost and wide range of applications.Single-use plastic products are more likely to end up in rivers than reusable options.Plastic is a non-biodegradable material and most plastic is made from fossil fuels. If burnt, it poisons the air; if buried, it pollutes the soil. And plastic wastes dumped haphazardly have been clogging sewer mains and rivers, and polluting oceans.Nepal still does not have effective waste recycling plants although several private firms have been recycling solid waste and producing compost manure on a small scale.According to an Asian Development Bank report, a waste composition analysis in Nepal indicates that the highest waste fraction is organic matter (66 percent), followed by plastics (12 percent), paper and paper products (9 percent), others (5 percent), and glass (3 percent). Metal, textiles, and rubber and leather each account for 2 percent or less.The most commonly found single-use plastic items in Nepal are plastic drinking bottles, littering rivers and rivulets. With the growing number of climbers, mainly on the world’s highest peak, Mt Everest, plastic waste has infiltrated the Himalayas and polluted freshwater sources.The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) said in its report that Kathmandu alone uses around 4.7 million to 4.8 million plastic bags a day. In Nepal, 16 percent of urban waste consists of plastic, which is 2.7 tonnes of daily plastic garbage production, it said.Besides the sheer quantity of plastic waste being produced, a major problem with plastic is its resistance to degradation, ICIMOD said. A conservative estimate puts the average time for one single plastic bag to completely biodegrade at 500 years, it said.“This means not only that most of the plastic we use during our lives will outlive us, but that our plastic footprint also will affect generations to come.”In April 2015, Nepal declared Kathmandu a polythene bag-free zone. Several other areas have followed suit and declared themselves plastic-free, including Parbat, Myagdi, Damak and Ilam.Plastic bans in urban mountain centres like Gangtok and Nainital in India in the late 1990s have demonstrated that daily life is as comfortable with reduced plastic use, according to ICIMOD.Since January 2020, the Everest region, which has gained notoriety as the “world’s highest garbage dump”, imposed a ban on the use of plastic bags, bottles and other plastic items, citing their adverse effects on human health.The use of plastic bags thinner than 30 microns has also been prohibited.The Everest region has long struggled to manage the solid waste visitors to the region bring along every year.On October 21, the Department of Tourism announced a ban on plastic bottles in four- and five-star deluxe and luxury hotels as a part of its push towards environmental sustainability.  \nDonald Trump is heading back to the Oval Office, defeating Kamala Harris to become the 47th President of the United States. With his return to power, questions arise about how his leadership might affect issues like women’s rights, access to abortion, and LGBTQIA+ advocacy worldwide.The implications for queer rights globally are hard to ignore—especially for countries like Nepal, where international solidarity and funding have propelled LGBTQIA+ advocacy.“If US support dries up, it could create challenges for queer movements worldwide, not just in Nepal,” says Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society, a pioneering LGBTQIA+ rights organisation in Nepal.Her concerns aren’t misplaced. Trump’s first presidency (2017–2021) dismantled key protections for queer communities, setting a troubling precedent.Organisations in the US have already spoken out against Trump’s policies. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a prominent civil rights organisation, released a detailed 10-page analysis of his administration, pledging to mobilise their network to counter these ‘dangerous policies’.During his first presidency, Trump rolled back key protections for LGBTQ+ individuals across multiple sectors, including healthcare, education, employment, and housing.Transgender individuals faced targeted actions, including a ban on serving openly in the military and the removal of LGBTQIA+ content from federal websites. LGBTQIA+ references were removed from a 2020 draft update of USAID policy, and repeated budget cuts to PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) undermined global efforts against HIV/AIDS.Trump’s Project 2025 proposals indicate even more extreme measures in his second term. These include banning gender-affirming care for minors, restricting federal funding for schools teaching ‘gender ideology’, and enforcing a binary gender recognition policy based on sex assigned on birth.Teachers suggesting alternative gender identities could face severe consequences. Transgender individuals could also be barred from participating in sports aligning with their gender identity.Internationally, such actions would expand anti-rights ideologies, as seen with Trump’s 2020 submission of the Geneva Consensus Declaration to the UN, an anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-abortion document.“During his first presidency, Trump removed the US special envoy for LGBTQ+ rights…. while Biden restored it, Trump is likely to do the same again,” says Sunil Babu Pant, a pioneer of the LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal and South Asia’s first openly queer lawmaker. “His stance on banning transgender rights will lead to serious setbacks for queer rights.”Dhakal says, “We stand in solidarity with LGBTQIA+ organisations in the US, Nepali LGBTQIA+ individuals in the US and oppose any action against human rights.”Dhakal’s organisation, Blue Diamond Society, has collaborated with several US-based human rights organisations, including Outright International, Save the Children, and USAID on various projects.Currently, they are running a project focused on HIV service delivery with USAID’s support, and it continues without any interruptions. They have not yet faced any funding issues or prohibitions.They had another project with USAID before Trump’s first term, which also continued with support throughout his presidency. “Trump’s second term begins in January, and while we’re uncertain about what may happen, we remain optimistic,” says Dhakal.While Dhakal hasn’t participated in formal discussions with donor agencies or international queer rights coalitions yet, informal talks regarding Trump’s administration have taken place during review meetings.“Strong financial support helps sustain momentum, expand visibility, and reach more people,” says Sarita KC, the executive director of Mitini Nepal. “This doesn’t mean that queer advocacy in Nepal will come to a halt without US support.”According to KC, Nepal’s queer advocacy has not been entirely dependent on US funding but rather benefited from their solidarity. International conferences hosted by US organisations, she says, have provided platforms for activists worldwide to collaborate and devise solutions. “If such conferences and their associated activities diminish, we will adapt and find new ways,” KC says. “Virtual meetings could be an alternative.”Mitini Nepal has not directly accessed USAID funds but has received support from some US-based international donors. While there have been discussions about potential funding challenges from donors, KC says that support from other countries, including the UK, Germany, and Finland, has started to grow. She believes this could counterbalance any reductions in US support.“I don’t think USAID, which considers human rights one of its core pillars, will pull out support for queer rights completely,” Dhakal says. “The agency would likely continue its support, either directly or indirectly.”While Obama and Biden’s administrations supported LGBTQIA+ rights, Trump’s stance is different. Given the US’s global influence, its policies will ripple across South Asia. Pant says that Trump’s anti-LGBTQIA+ policies and provocative remarks will embolden conservative and religious groups in South Asia, including Nepal.The effect has already been seen.Two months ago, a new political party Aamul Paribartan Nagarik Party in Nepal introduced an agenda aligning with Trump’s election anti-abortion and anti-queer campaign stance and did a protest rally in Maitighar opposing homosexuality, gender transition, and abortion.Recently, KC from Mitini Nepal attended the Equal Rights Coalition conference in Berlin, Germany on December 17 and 18 where discussions centred around the rise of global anti-gender and anti-queer movements. Speculations were raised about Trump’s campaign being a driving force behind these movements. “In Nepal and neighbouring countries, anti-queer sentiments are gaining momentum,” KC says. “Such agendas are likely encouraged by external powers promoting anti-queer rhetoric.”Pant, who is also the executive director of Mayako Pahichan Nepal, adds that activism should not rely solely on foreign donors. “We should become stronger within our nation with government support,” he says.According to Pant, Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ movement began in a challenging era and has seen worse. “While it’s a concern worth discussing, we shouldn’t be overly frightened by foreign shocks,” he adds. “Nepal’s constitution and laws won’t change overnight just because of Trump’s words.”Dhakal, too, thinks that Nepal, as a sovereign nation, should not be swayed by potential US policy changes under Trump. “Nepal has its own constitution and judicial support for LGBTQIA+ rights,” she says. “We shouldn’t adopt negative practices, even from powerful nations.”Dhakal, who is also a founding member of the Asia-Pacific Transgender Network and board member of the International Reference Group on Transgender Women and HIV/AIDS (IRGT), says that their advocacy will continue no matter what. “We in South Asia will join forces with international human rights and queer rights organisations to support queer rights in the US and worldwide,” Dhakal says.“Nepal should speak in international forums and conventions against anti-queer activities. If Nepal remains progressive, it can set an example,” Dhakal adds. “Even a global power can learn from small nations.” \nThe Ministry of Health and Population said that a decision on whether to lower the iodine content in salt will be taken only after a micronutrient status survey, which will start in May next year.The nationwide survey to be carried out after 10 years, with the financial support of USAID and technical support of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be completed in 2026.“The decision to lower the iodine content in salt will be taken only after assessing the level of iodine in the urine of children and pregnant women,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We hope the new report of the micronutrient survey will help us make appropriate decisions.”Iodine is a mineral found naturally in seafood and plants that grow in areas near the sea. In places where iodine is naturally rare, it needs to be artificially introduced into the diet via fortified food products.The Salt Trading Corporation, the agency responsible for importing and distributing salt in Nepal, fortifies iodine at 50 ppm (parts per million) per kilogram of salt, which is higher than the recommended dosage. The World Health Organisation, however, recommends iodine concentration at 15 to 40 ppm per kg. Only 40 ppm of iodine per kilogramme of salt is fortified for India, as it is assumed that the Indian population does not need as much iodine as the Nepali people, since they also get iodine content from foods produced near the ocean.Health experts in Nepal have blamed the excessive amounts of iodine content in salt for the rise in non-communicable diseases, including hypothyroidism.Several studies—including the 2016 Nepal National Micronutrient Status Survey jointly carried out by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, the US-based Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Ministry of Health and Population—found that Nepalis consume excessive amounts of iodine, which has resulted in high prevalence of hyperthyroidism, a condition when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones.The survey showed that more than two-thirds—68 percent—of the population across the country is consuming iodine far in excess of the recommended levels.According to the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factors: Steps Survey-2019, 5.6 percent of the adults (6.5 percent of women and 4.6 percent of men) reported adding salt often or always to food right before or while eating.Additionally, 19.5 percent of the adults (18.1 percent of the women and 21.1 percent of men) reported consuming processed foods that are often or always high in salt.Doctors in Nepal suspect that the high iodine content in the salt being sold in Nepal could be among the reasons for the high prevalence of several non-communicable diseases, including thyroid disorders and hypertension.A change in dietary patterns and an increased consumption of processed foods (including packaged soups) have resulted in an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, they added.Earlier, the government had sent a team of experts to salt factories in India’s Gujarat state to study the iodine fortification process and the possibility of lowering the iodine content in salt. The expert team furnished its report, but the concerned authorities could not decide on the reduction of iodine level in salt.“We have decided to wait further until the report of the planned survey comes,” said Thapa. “The report will help us analyse what changes have happened in the last 10 years and make appropriate decisions.”In 1993, Nepal mandated that salt be fortified with iodine to prevent health problems caused by iodine deficiency, as salt is both cheap and used round the year.Officials said the higher iodine level was mandated for Nepal under the assumption that transport and storage times were longer at the time as the salt had to be carried on the backs of men and animals and some amount of iodine would dissipate by the time the salt reached markets, mainly in the remote parts of the country.However, with roads reaching almost all corners of the country, transportation time has significantly decreased, so there is no need for such a high level of iodine in salt, say doctors.The World Health Organisation recommends less than two grams of sodium or five grams of salt per day for adults to reduce blood pressure, and cut the risks of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. \nLocal pro Niraj Tamang carded a bogey-free 8-under 62 in the first round of the Surya Nepal Eastern Open, the third event under Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, at the par-70 Dharan Golf Club on Wednesday.Tamang carded a new course record with the help of six birdies and sank an eagle to make a flying start on his home course, opening up a four-stroke lead over Dhana Bahadur Thapa, who carded a 4-under 66. Bhuwan Kumar Rokka is third after he carded 3-under 67, while Yuvaraj Bhujel, Bishnu Prasad Sharma and amateur Sunder Rai are tied for fourth at 2-under 68.Top pro Bhuvan Nagarkoti, local pro Bal Bhadra Rai and amateur Jitendra Rai share seventh position at 1-under 69. Ramesh Adhikari, who had a hole-in-one on hole number eight, is tied with Rame Magar, Sunil KC, Rabi Khadka and amateur Suresh Tamang in the 10th position at 1-over 71.Leader Tamang carded 4-under 32 on the front nine with the help of birdies on the third, fifth, sixth and ninth holes. He then sank an eagle on the 12th hole and carded birdies on the 15th and 18th holes to finish the back nine at 4-under 30.Thapa took the turn at 2-under 34 after he dropped a shot on the second hole and carded birdies on the third, eighth and ninth holes. The Army Club pro carded 2-under 32 on the back nine. He faced a bogey on the 13th hole against birdies on the 12th, 16th and 18th holes.Rokka carded 2-under 34 on the front nine and played 1-under 33 on the back nine. He began the day with a bogey on the first hole before carding birdies on the third, seventh and ninth holes. After taking the turn, Rokka carded birdies on the 15th and 18th holes and faced a bogey on the 17th hole. A total of 29 professional golfers and 27 amateurs are participating in the event organised by the PGA Nepal under the sponsorship of Surya Nepal Pvt Ltd. Cut will be applied after 36 holes and top 21 pros and amateurs making the pro cut will advance to the final round. The event carries a cash purse of Rs882,000. The champion will take home Rs150,000, while the runner-up will receive Rs100,000. The third-place golfer will earn Rs75,000. The top 21 pros will secure a share of the prize money.The Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25 features a total of eight tournaments, offering a combined prize pool of Rs6.732 million for the season. \nIn a secretariat meeting of the ruling CPN-UML held on Wednesday, Prime Minister and party chairman KP Sharma Oli briefed secretariat members on the political situation after the formation of the coalition with the Nepali Congress, the government's effectiveness and weaknesses, and his China visit in the first week of December, among other issues.Immediately after Oli's briefing, the secretariat members also expressed their views on the latest situation, said a UML secretariat member. The secretariat meeting also discussed the agenda of the central committee meeting which would be held on January 5 and 6.The secretariat meeting stressed the need for giving momentum to the government by expediting service delivery. The meeting also suggested reforms to make the government's functioning more effective, according to the secretariat member.An eight-member task force formed by the Congress and the UML on November 6 to strengthen ties between two parties decided to form a six-member committee to work on the issue.The Congress has appointed Semanta Dahal, Arun Paudel, and Pratap Paudel as members to suggest on service delivery. In contrast, former chief secretary of the government Lila Gadtaula and senior advocates Kedar Koirala and Rajendra Ghimire were appointed by the UML. “The prime minister's office will be our secretariat, and we are assigned to start our work from Thursday,” a service delivery task force member said. “The main job of the task force is to give policy advice to minimise hassle related to service delivery.” The task force formed to strengthen the two-party relations has Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, and Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba from the Congress. UML senior vice-chair Ishwor Pokharel, vice-chair and Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, and political adviser to the prime minister and Deputy General Secretary Bishnu Rimal are the party’s members.Congress vice-chair Khadka said that during the task force meeting, they discussed ways to address the issue of amending the constitution and other pertinent matters. “The two parties have formally entered the agenda of amending the constitution and are considering forming a mechanism for the same shortly,” Khadka said. Amending the constitution was a key promise of the seven-point agreement signed between Nepal’s two largest political parties, the Congress and the UML, in early July while forming the government led by Oli. The two parties' meeting on Tuesday, which lasted almost three hours, also discussed potential candidates to lead the constitutional amendment process. Likewise, the two ruling parties have formed a separate task force to speed up the passage of bills through Parliament.Every party has parliamentary leaders, chief whip and whip in Parliament who look after issues related to the bill, Khadka said. “Besides, we also have various committees in Parliament for the same.” \nWith the ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—starting the groundwork for the review and amendment of the constitution, the debate over the whole process is heating up. The ruling forces have rightly taken the initiative to implement the pledge they made while forming the coalition government over five months ago. They justified the ‘unusual coalition’ of two largest political parties saying it was the ‘only way’ the constitution could be amended.The seven-point agreement between the Congress and the UML in July stated that the KP Sharma Oli-led government would give priority to making amendments to the constitution and formulating laws that ensure political stability by evaluating the strengths, weaknesses and the complexities witnessed during the course of its implementation in the past nine years.A constitution should be a living document and flexibility on amendments and upgrades undoubtedly help with its sustainability. The constitution of India is often cited as an example in this regard. Promulgated by the Constituent Assembly of India in November 1949, the Indian constitution has been amended 106 times thus far. Likewise, many other democratic countries have succeeded in protecting their constitutions for long. The United States has been implementing the same one for the past 236 years.But in the past seven and half decades, Nepal has already produced and implemented seven constitutions. As the debate on review and amendment of the current constitution picks up, the statute will complete just a decade in September 2025. So there are a few vital things Nepali politicians and constitutional experts need to keep in mind. It is vital to address the concerns and grievances of various political, social and other actors. But as important is to ensure that while addressing the demands of all and sundry, the foundations of the charter are not undermined. Another major point the Congress-UML alliance vowed in the seven-point deal is to deliver political stability. Without constitutional stability, political forces can’t give political and policy stability. Though it’s not easy to garner the two-thirds majority required for constitutional amendment, the opposition parties have not ruled out their support for such a process. But they do appear wary of the prospect of the ruling alliance trying to bulldoze the process. If the ruling parties indeed try to forcibly push through such changes—for instance with the intent of obliterating small political parties—it would be a disaster. It will then make Nepali polity less rather than more stable. The country has been facing various challenges in implementing the statute due to the failure to accommodate various political forces right at the start, when the charter was being finalised in 2015. The new initiative shouldn’t end up opening old wounds. For that, all political forces and stakeholders should be taken on board at every step of the new process. That is the only way to ensure the charter’s sustainability and to make it work as well. Once the process starts and a body is entrusted with reviewing the statute, the demands raised by various groups and agendas put forth by different factions within the major parties will gradually take shape and the debate will enter a formal stage. Done prudently from the start, it can help make the national charter a potent document that can guide the country for a long-long time. Get it wrong, and the country could have to pay for it for perhaps even longer.  \nArtificial intelligence is the product of an unbounded craving for automation. Since the beginning of human civilisation, we have been inventing new machines and technologies to reduce our physical and mental efforts to accomplish tasks. The fascination with automatic intelligent thinking machines that can function as human brains have shaped the narratives of different eras of human history, coloured the imagination of scientists of different epochs and constructed the plots of science fiction. According to reports, those scientists and philosophers who described the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols were the first to plant the seeds of AI. The invention of programmable digital computers in the 1940s and the use of mathematical reasoning in their functioning made some scientists hopeful towards building electronic brains. For this purpose, AI research was founded at a workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956, where John McCarthy, an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist, introduced the term “artificial intelligence”.After countless experiments and many failures, scientists have created several forms of AI for different objectives. However, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in writing or composition has ignited widespread debate over their legitimacy, morality and suitability. Since its inception on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT’s use has drawn the attention of many theorists and scholars of writing pedagogy as it is now regarded as a thinking machine that can generate human-like texts. This intelligent machine can change traditional pedagogical practices by transforming the writing process, including students’ approach towards writing assignments. Some theorists think that these tools can negatively affect the writing process, while others believe that they can be used as reliable tools to move to different stages of the writing process. Positive uses of AI These days, student writers have access to various AI tools with diverse functions that help them go through different stages of the writing process. Grammarly is an editing tool that checks grammar, spelling, punctuation and style and gives required suggestions for further improvements. Quillbot can be used for paraphrasing; Snazzy AI for content creation; Sribbr Plagiarism Checker for detecting intellectual theft and ensuring originality. Among these tools, ChatGPT is regarded as the smartest and most powerful electronic thinking brain due to its ability to navigate corpus texts and produce human-like texts. Undoubtedly, AI’s prudent and creative application can assist student writers in the writing process, to which even pundits of composition pedagogy agree. For example, Generative AI manipulates the process of machine learning to generate results from the existing online corpus data by detecting recurring patterns. Gen AIs like ChatGPT can instantly work on user prompts and create desired texts. Even in academic settings, the likelihood of using diverse writing-related AI tools by students cannot be denied. This means that the future of writing or composition will be shaped by the invasion of AIs into these territories. So, we must use AIs creatively, honestly and wisely in education to maintain academic aura and integrity. This can bring opportunities for positive changes in education, particularly in teachers’ and students’ academic performance in writing and other activities. Negative impacts Despite the merits of AI in the writing process, they are not without flaws. The latest version of ChatGPT, which has become more powerful and creative in generating diverse texts, has made compositionists anxious about its consequences. They believe such tools may cause adverse effects on the overall writing process. They have detected serious flaws in AI-generated writing and are also concerned about the future of teaching writing and the possible misuse of AI by student writers. Opponents of AI have pointed out some drawbacks to the unrestricted and unchecked use of writing tools. First, AI tools lack the human creativity or cognition to differentiate bad content from good ones. There are also issues pertinent to the violation of copyright and plagiarism in writing. Moreover, large language models have been encoded in linguistic patterns of the so-called dominant language, English, which may give birth to a new form of colonialism and undermine the spirit of social justice for which minorities have been fighting for generations. The concept of linguistic inclusiveness in composition pedagogy and translanguaging (how bilinguals and multilinguals utilise their language skills to understand and engage with their environment) will likely be affected. Additionally, AI lacks humans’ crystallised intelligence/knowledge, contextual understanding and syntactical innovation and cannot be involved in meaning-making. Furthermore, AI cannot detect biases and discriminatory content found in their source data. AI-generated texts can cross all the boundaries of propriety, linguistic justice and social inclusiveness by creating unreadable and unacceptable texts. These contents are also just imitations, which can be repetitive and factually incorrect. In short, AI cannot work independently in expected ways. Human intervention and creativity are required to check them constantly. To bridge the divided perspectives and achieve a balance, student writers need to mitigate the negative aspects of AI-generated texts to save their composition, ingenuity and authenticity. They should use these tools as one relies on co-authors to assist with pre-and post-writing activities such as idea generation, editing and proofreading. Students should understand that depending entirely on AI will not be beneficial in the long run. After all, these tools aren’t independent thinkers and cannot replace our originality and empirical knowledge. \nAfter more than seven decades of independence, Indian politics finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with complex issues that challenge its foundational ideals. While it may be misleading to draw direct parallels with neighbouring Bangladesh, the invocation of Dr BR Ambedkar the iconic architect of the Indian Constitution into contemporary debates as recently happened in the Upper House of Parliament highlights a significant conundrum.This reference reflects not only our un-statesmanlike attitude but also our uncharitable attitude towards a stalwart who championed the rights of the underprivileged during an era when nationalist politics largely marginalised him. Even today, discussions surrounding the thinker qua activist Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar evoke multiple discourses, positioning him in a metaphorical rehearsal room of history, awaiting an authentic assessment by future generations. His legacy serves as both a reminder and a challenge to current political narratives, urging us to confront the undue turns that politics takes for its own benefits. In reflecting on Professor Khilnani’s profound observation that Indian history is often portrayed as a “curiously unpeopled place”, we are morally bound to consider the essential contributions of its founding fathers.The question arises—can we envision India without acknowledging figures such as Kabir, Phule, Birsa Munda, Periyar, and Ambedkar? These individuals form the bedrock of the Indian Constitution and embody the multicultural essence of our society. Their legacies are steeped in a relentless struggle for justice and equality, which resonates through an immeasurable saga of sacrifice. Therefore, modern India cannot be understood solely through the glossy lenses of Yoga, discussions in well decorated seminar rooms on the ‘civilisation state’, or grand narratives of economic growth.Instead, it is crucial to recognise how the enduring thoughts and philosophies of these thinkers awakened the dormant masses from antiquity and shaped the identity of today’s Indian republic. Today, when we examine India, it is clear that its path to freedom was not a sudden midnight epiphany but rather a gradual evolution shaped by influential figures like Ambedkar. His contributions are inseparable from the annals of modern Indian history, as he dedicated his life to navigating the country towards radical experiments in social justice. Ambedkar’s polemics resonate with those of critical thinkers in that it boldly posed volleys of perturbing questions and thus challenged the entrenched system of caste/cultural hegemony, positioning himself against the mainstream currents of Indian nationalism.His efforts laid the groundwork for a more equitable society, highlighting the complexities and struggles inherent in India’s perennial quest for true freedom. The Indian state’s political actions, often driven by elite centralisation, clash with Ambedkar’s ideals, which diverge significantly from the narratives of major political entities like the Congress Party or current majoritarian frameworks. Ambedkar embodies a challenge to these dominant discourses, advocating for true democracy and genuine welfare for marginalised groups, including Adivasis. In contrast, the prevailing political logic tends to accommodate these communities not out of a benign commitment to democratic principles but rather as a means to construct a cohesive national entity capable of generating economic surplus. This approach prioritises the construction of political stability to strengthen the state over authentic democratic engagement and inclusivity in India’s diverse multicultural landscape. Even today, it appears that the elites are making concerted efforts to promote new discourses aimed at unifying India, particularly at a time when achieving a cohesive national identity seems increasingly challenging. The political landscape is heavily influenced by the narrative of “one nation, one election,” which seeks to streamline governance and enhance national unity. However, this push for a singular identity must be viewed through the lens of India’s multicultural society, which complicates the realisation of such a grand elitist vision.In this context, it is essential to critically examine and reflect on the cultural dimensions of our diverse populace. Many regions and sections experience psychological unease regarding the overarching project of transforming various social groups into a modern citizenry that would be loyal and acquiescent to the state. This necessitates a deeper understanding of how identity symbolism interacts with the lived realities of different communities across India. Thus, we understand that Ambedkar is no longer merely a protestant icon against the scourge of untouchability; today, his spirit gets amplified and becomes the pivotal embodiment as the key ideologue of social justice. His thought serves as a formidable barrier against the evolving challenges posed by the Indian state, particularly its attempts to undermine accountability amidst a crisis-ridden capitalism that threatens to stifle substantive democracy.This situation risks rendering the state increasingly authoritarian in a Hegelian sense. Consequently, any reference to Ambedkar must be approached with sensitivity, or else a murky climate of thought or similar veiled attempts might ultimately be self-defeating, if not condescending to India’s vast multitude of unequal citizens, hence undemocratic and unparliamentary.-The Statesman (India) / ANN \nNepal is ahead of many countries in LGBTQIA+ rights and policies. The Constitution of Nepal recognises gender and sexual minorities, which even developed countries like the US don’t explicitly mention. Moreover, the judiciary’s support for the rights of the queer community has increased in recent years. While these achievements seem noteworthy at the outset, there is still a huge disparity between the laws and the reality queer people face every day. In Nepal, while much of the activism for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community still focuses on something as basic as identity and legal recognition, issues like the sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) of these communities remain overlooked. Although the Constitution of Nepal ensures fundamental rights, such as reproductive rights under the Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health Act (2018) for gender and sexual minorities, these provisions haven’t effectively catered to the sexual and reproductive health of these communities.The discrimination and stigma that gender and sexual minorities face daily manifests in their general inaccessibility of fundamental rights in Nepal. Programmes related to SRHR are usually associated with cisgender women and ignore LGBTQIA+ individuals. Queer folks are judged and ridiculed not just by their family members but also by the health staff at hospitals and health posts. This is problematic in a country where transgender people are forced to undergo surgery for medical verification to be legally recognised as “male” or “female”. Gender-affirming surgery requires medical professionals to follow certain clinical protocols; however, the existing law does not address gender reassignment. In August, the Supreme Court made landmark progress in recognising LGBTQIA+ rights by ruling that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, must be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without requiring medical verification; however, the law for legal recognition remains the same for all. So, these individuals have no option but to travel to India for surgeries, which can be expensive and unsafe. Moreover, transgender men, lesbians and bisexual individuals often struggle to access basic menstrual hygiene products and healthcare facilities related to safe motherhood and abortion. The path to having and parenting children is fraught with difficulties for queer individuals, as IVF and adoption facilities aren’t accessible. While surrogacy is legal for infertile married Nepali couples, it is prohibited for singles, transgender couples and foreign nationals.Many people have the misconception that only cisgender women menstruate, but anyone with a uterus can experience it. These narratives arise through the limited awareness of our society and restrictive school curriculums. Such a perpetuation of false ideas further influences dominant ideas in popular platforms. Rarely do we see people from the LGBTQIA+ communities in the advertisements of sanitary pads or contraceptives. These communities often receive attention only during Pride Month (June), but progress in SRHR and other issues requires ongoing efforts, not just a month of focus.The legal recognition of same-sex marriage between Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung in 2023 made many hopeful about the future of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ individuals. Conversations about the potential of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ tourism (rainbow tourism) have emerged since. To ensure its sustainability, we must prioritise fundamentals such as SRHR for the queer communities to create a safe space for them. For our economy to benefit from their participation, it must ensure that their primary needs are met with dignity.Our leaders cannot dismiss the issues of queer people by relying on the superficial claims of LGBTQIA+ policy advancements. Yes, there has been progress, but it is not enough. Lawmakers must understand that queer rights go beyond sexuality and identity and include all aspects of human rights, such as the right to sexual and reproductive health. Laws can only go so far if we do not change our deeply rooted beliefs and accept people for who they are while providing essential services. \nSouth Korea’s Constitutional Court will hold its first hearing on Friday in the case of President Yoon Suk Yeol, after parliament impeached him over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3.Here are key issues for South Korea’s road ahead.WHAT NEXT?After being impeached on Dec. 14, Yoon’s presidential powers are suspended but he remains in office, retaining his immunity from most charges except for insurrection or treason. Yoon-appointed Prime Minister Han Duck-soo is acting president.The Constitutional Court must decide within 180 days whether to remove Yoon from office or reject the impeachment and restore his powers. If the court removes Yoon or he resigns, a presidential election must be held within 60 days.The court is due to hold its first preparatory hearing on Friday.Opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Jung Chung-rae, the head of parliament’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee, is leading the case for removing Yoon.Yoon’s legal counsel has not yet been announced, but his background as a prosecutor has sparked reports that he is turning to former colleagues or could even represent himself.Kim Hong-il, a former prosecutor and former head of the broadcasting regulator under Yoon, as well as former Constitutional Court spokesperson Bae Bo-yoon, are expected to join Yoon’s legal teams in the impeachment review and in criminal investigations, local media has reported.IMPEDIMENTS TO A COURT RULING?Under South Korea’s constitution, six justices must agree in order to oust an impeached president. The nine-member Constitutional Court now has three vacancies, so the current justices would have to vote unanimously to remove Yoon.The Constitutional Court has said that it can deliberate and hear arguments with just six justices.The three vacancies are allotted for parliament to fill. The main opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, is seeking to fill the vacancies.Parliament held a hearing for two potential nominees on Monday, which the ruling People Power Party boycotted, saying that acting president Han does not have the right to appoint Constitutional Court justices.There is precedent for an acting president appointing a Constitutional Court justice, as occurred when former President Park Geun-hye was impeached in 2016-2017.WHAT HAPPENS IN COURT?In South Korea’s only previous presidential removal by impeachment, the court took three months to oust Park in 2017.This time, the terms of two court justices expire in April, and legal experts predict the court may seek to rule before then to minimise uncertainty.In the past, academics say, Constitutional Court justices have not voted predictably by political leaning but have decided case by case, based on their interpretation of the constitution.Conservative attempts to rally popular support for Yoon are not expected to affect the court’s ruling, as Park was removed from office despite continued conservative rallies to keep her in power, warring with candlelight rallies to remove her from power.In the case of Park, who like Yoon was from a centre-right party, the court voted unanimously to remove her, including some justices viewed as conservative and two Park appointees.Yoon also faces criminal investigations related to the martial law decision.If charged, he could ask the Constitutional Court to suspend the 180-day clock on the impeachment ruling. The court denied a similar request in Park’s case.In 2004, then-President Roh Moo-hyun, from a centre-left party, was impeached on the charge of failing to maintain political neutrality as required of a high public official.The court rejected the motion after about two months, and Roh fulfilled his five-year term. \nBombardment by Pakistani military aircraft in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province on Tuesday killed at least 46 people, most of whom were children and women, the Afghan Taliban said, adding it would retaliate.Six people were also injured in the bombing at four locations in Afghanistan, deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said on Wednesday.Pakistani government and military officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Afghanistan’s foreign office said it had summoned Pakistan’s head of mission in Kabul to deliver a formal protest note to Islamabad on the bombing by Pakistani military aircraft, warning the diplomat of consequences of such actions.“Afghanistan considers this brutal act a blatant violation of all international principles and an obvious act of aggression,” Enayatullah Khowrazmi, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defence, said in a statement. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered.”A Pakistani official with knowledge of the matter, but declining to be named, told Reuters Pakistan had carried out airstrikes against a camp of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) Islamist militant group.TTP pledges allegiance to, and gets its name from the Afghan Taliban, but is not directly a part of the group that rules Afghanistan. Its stated aim is to impose Islamic religious law in Pakistan, as the Taliban has done in Afghanistan.A major TTP attack in Pakistan’s South Waziristan area, which borders the location of the alleged camp targeted in Afghanistan, killed 16 Pakistani security personnel on Saturday.Afghanistan’s defence ministry identified those killed in Pakistan’s bombardment as “mostly Waziristani refugees” - indicating that they were from Pakistan’s Waziristan territory.The neighbours have a strained relationship, with Pakistan saying that several TTP attacks that have occurred in its country have been launched from Afghan soil - a charge the Afghan Taliban denies.Their relationship was complicated in March when the Taliban accused Pakistan of carrying out two airstrikes on its territory, killing five women and children.Pakistan said at the time it had conducted “intelligence-based anti-terrorist operations” in Afghanistan but did not specify the nature of the operations. \nRishi Handa is an educator and researcher specialising in South Asian and Punjab studies with a PhD from SOAS University of London. He currently heads the Sanskrit and Religious Studies departments at St James Senior Boys’ School, England, also teaching Mathematics and Ancient Greek.In addition to his academic work, Handa is a musician who co-founded the band ‘Flute That Groove’ and performed with artists like Anup Jalota, an Indian singer known for his contributions to the Bhajan genre of Indian music. He is fluent in several languages, including Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, English, and Sanskrit, combining his skills in education, music, and cultural exchange.In this chat with the Post’s Aarya Chand, Handa discusses his career, blending education, cultural studies, and music while reflecting on his academic and creative experiences.As the Head of Sanskrit at a British school, how do you approach teaching this ancient language to students who might not have a cultural or historical connection to it?I use an unconventional approach, focusing on neuroscience and psychology, to make Sanskrit learning enjoyable. I introduce letters through puzzles and crosswords. To make vocabulary engaging, I incorporate hip-hop beats. I teach grammar tables vertically to help students see patterns, making it easy for them to understand the logic rather than just memorising it.The challenges include helping neurodiverse students who may struggle with memorisation or pronunciation. I guide them step-by-step through sound mechanics for pronunciation.Teaching Sanskrit alongside Latin and Ancient Greek, highlighting their structural similarities, creates opportunities for cognitive development. It trains the brain to think in a systematic and logical process.You have a rich academic background spanning both philosophy and mathematics. How do you think these two fields complement each other?Philosophy and mathematics complement each other in promoting critical thinking by focusing on logic and reasoning. Philosophy encourages students to explore the ‘why’, question assumptions, and analyse arguments, while mathematics emphasises the ‘how’ through structured problem-solving. As a teacher of both, I use my background in mathematics to clarify reasoning in philosophy and connect abstract mathematical concepts to more general guidelines. Together, these fields develop creative and logical thinking, giving students a strong foundation for critical thinking and intellectual growth.Your band, ‘Flute That Groove’, blends Indian classical instruments with contemporary sounds. How do you see music contributing to cultural preservation and bridging cultural divides, particularly in a globalised world?Music contributes to cultural preservation and bridges cultural divides. People interested in world music may be drawn to a particular genre, like Western folk fans who appreciate Indian classical music. While Indian classical music has a bit of an acquired taste and is not for everyone, fusion music, like what we do, blends Indian and Western instruments. This allows us to play Indian songs in a Western-style or put an Indian twist on English songs.Music unites people by blending different cultural elements, creating something that resonates with a broader range of listeners.How do you view the role of multilingualism in enhancing cultural understanding and academic research?Understanding each other’s languages is the gateway to understanding a culture. Language defines a culture, and without it, the culture is lost. Every language has a unique way of expressing ideas, and there is no perfect one-to-one translation between them. For example, in English, we prefer the active voice, such as ‘the man eats the apple,’ but Sanskrit typically favours the passive, like ‘the apple is eaten by the man.’This reflects a different way of thinking. In Sanskrit, the focus is more on the object than the subject. This aligns with philosophies like Vedanta, where one sees oneself as the instrument rather than the doer.Moreover, certain words don't have direct translations. Words like ‘Vishwas’, ‘Nishtha’, and ‘Shraddha’ are often translated as ‘faith’, but each carries its unique connotation in the Indian context. Understanding such nuances is essential.One’s understanding is limited and filtered without knowing a culture's language. I’ve seen how knowing the original language, like Greek for the Bible, can change everything. During a debate, I remember someone using Greek insights to shift the whole perspective, showing how language deepens cultural understanding.What was your most memorable experience in Nepal? Did you find similarities between the cultural or religious practices and your studies of South Asian traditions?My experience in Nepal has been insightful. One of my most memorable moments was discovering the connection between the practices here and my research on the Udasi tradition, which is rooted in Guru Nanak’s teachings. Before arriving in Nepal, I felt unsure because I had no prior knowledge or frame of reference for the country. Unlike India, which was somewhat familiar to me, Nepal was entirely unfamiliar. However, people assured me of the country’s warm and friendly nature, and their words turned out to be true. The culture here feels grounded, and the people are calm, which I find refreshing. I’ve also been struck by the lack of anger or aggression. Even when navigating through crowds, there’s a sense of calmness. Something special happened when I visited a local area in Kathmandu and stumbled upon a Udasi Ashram, which was a perfect, unexpected connection to my academic research. The discovery felt like a stroke of serendipity. As I wandered down an unassuming alley, I heard verses from the Guru Granth Sahib streaming through a window. I hadn't expected to encounter such a place during my visit to Nepal, which made it all the more meaningful given my studies of South Asian and Punjabi traditions.With a diverse professional background that includes teaching, music, and filmmaking, what inspires you to keep exploring new avenues? Are there any upcoming projects or ideas you are particularly excited about?I’ve always been passionate about exploring new ideas, and my background in teaching, music, and filmmaking reflects my curiosity and willingness to blend disciplines. Learning and growing continue to drive me, as each experience adds a layer to my understanding of the world. As for upcoming projects, I am excited to develop an app that teaches Indian languages, including Sanskrit, in an easy and accessible way. I aim to help preserve and promote these languages, particularly among the Western diaspora, where many people have become disconnected from their language roots.My method is based on neuroscience and psychology, which makes language learning more intuitive and effortless. I dream of making learning languages like Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, and Punjabi accessible to all ages. The app will be designed in such a way that after just a few hours, someone will be able to start reading newspapers in these languages. I’m also considering including spoken Sanskrit courses, as there is significant interest from those who wish to reconnect with their roots but find traditional methods too tricky. Creating this accessible learning space excites me, and I look forward to seeing how it evolves.Rishi Handa’s book recommendationsI Am ThatAuthor: Nisargadatta MaharajPublisher: Chetana PublishingYear: 1973In this book, an illiterate cigarette seller from Mumbai offers conversations on spirituality, self-realisation, and the nature of existence.Guru Granth SahibAuthor: Compiled by Guru Arjan Dev (and others)Publisher: Sikh religious authoritiesYear: 1604This is a sacred scripture of the Sikh faith.

As of now, hilly regions are partly to generally cloudy, while the rest of the country remains partly cloudy to mostly clear. Some areas of the Tarai are covered with fog or mist. This afternoon, hilly areas of Gandaki and Koshi provinces are expected to have partly cloudy to mainly clear skies, with mostly clear weather predicted for the rest of the country. Tonight, hilly regions of Sudurpaschim, Karnali, Lumbini, and Gandaki provinces will experience partly to generally cloudy skies, while other areas will remain mostly clear. Light snowfall is expected in one or two high-altitude locations in Gandaki Province. \nSeveral provinces, including Sudurpaschim, Karnali, Lumbini, and Gandaki, will witness light to moderate rainfall starting Friday night as moisture-laden westerly wind enters the country from the Mediterranean Sea.The Kathmandu valley will also witness light rainfall on Saturday due to the western disturbances, the Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology said.“Sudurpaschim and Karnali Province will witness light to moderate rainfall. Lumbini, Gandaki Province, will receive light rain,” said Saroj Pudasaini, a meteorologist at the division. “Hilly and mountainous areas of Gandaki Province will witness snowfall.”Meteorologists say that the western disturbance is a phenomenon that affects the weather patterns of the Indian subcontinent, including Nepal. It is a low-pressure system that originates in the Mediterranean region and moves eastward.“Western parts of the country will be affected much, and the weather system will become weak when it moves eastward,” said Binod Pokhrel, an associate professor at the Central Department of Hydrology and Meteorology. “Even if rain does not occur in the eastern part, the day will remain cloudy on Saturday.”The rain is expected to bring relief from rising air pollution. Met officials say the temperature will decline further due to the rain. Kathmandu Valley witnessed scattered rainfall on Tuesday evening, but due to cloudy conditions, the minimum temperature did not fall much on Wednesday morning.According to the Met Office, the minimum temperature of the Valley was recorded 6.7 degrees Celsius on Wednesday morning.The weather will improve from Sunday. \nNepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has declared Karnali Development Bank, a Class ‘B’ licensed financial institution, as a “troubled institution” and assumed its management. The decision was made during a board meeting on Wednesday, citing financial irregularities and governance issues.As per Section 86(B) of the Nepal Rastra Bank Act 2002, NRB has formed a three-member management team led by Deputy Director Tikaram Khatri from the Bank and Financial Institution Regulation Department. Other members include Deputy Directors Bishnu Kumar Bishwakarma from the Financial Institution Supervision Department and Jugal Kishore Kushwaha from the Legal Department. The team will assume responsibility for the bank effective from December 26.NRB spokesperson Ramu Paudel stated that the management team has been granted authority under prevailing laws to exercise the duties and rights of the bank’s board and special general assembly. The team’s mandate includes prioritising deposit repayments, recovering loans, assessing assets and liabilities, and investigating financial irregularities for legal action.The central bank clarified that Karnali Development Bank failed to maintain the minimum capital adequacy ratio, exhibited weak institutional governance, and struggled to meet deposit repayment obligations due to liquidity issues. Additionally, with a non-performing loan ratio of 40.85 percent, the bank’s financial health has deteriorated significantly.NRB has further highlighted that continuing the institution’s operations in its current state would jeopardise depositor interests and erode trust in the banking system. Consequently, the move to declare the institution troubled was necessary to safeguard public interests, the central bank has said.The financial institution had already been subjected to Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) under NRB’s regulations effective November 26. This measure aimed to enforce reforms, but the bank’s worsening condition necessitated stronger intervention.The management team’s immediate focus will be to protect depositor funds and ensure the institution’s obligations are met, alongside conducting a detailed due diligence audit. The central bank said it remains committed to taking legal action against those responsible for the financial misconduct uncovered during investigations. \nAn Embraer (EMBR3.SA), passenger plane flying from Azerbaijan to Russia crashed near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan on Wednesday with 62 passengers and five crew on board, Kazakh authorities announced, saying that 27 people had survived.Unverified video of the crash showed the plane, which was operated by Azerbaijan Airlines, bursting into flames as it hit the ground and thick black smoke then rising. Bloodied and bruised passengers could be seen stumbling from a piece of the fuselage that had remained intact.The Central Asian country’s emergencies ministry said in a statement that fire services had put out the blaze and that the survivors, including three children, were being treated at a nearby hospital.Azerbaijan Airlines said the Embraer 190 aircraft, with flight number J2-8243, had been flying from Baku to Grozny, the capital of Russia’s Chechnya, but had been forced to make an emergency landing approximately 3 km (1.8 miles) from the Kazakh city of Aktau.Russian news agencies said the plane had been rerouted due to fog in Grozny.Authorities in Kazakhstan said they had begun looking into different possible versions of what had happened, including a technical problem, Russia’s Interfax news agency reported.Russia’s aviation watchdog said in a statement that preliminary information suggested the pilot had decided to make an emergency landing after a bird strike.Following the crash, Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, was returning home from Russia where he had been due to attend a summit on Wednesday, Russia’s RIA news agency reported.Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, expressed his condolences in a statement and said those being treated in hospital were in an extremely serious condition and that he and others would pray for their rapid recovery. \n\nThe issue of banning helicopter sightseeing tours in one of the world’s most iconic natural regions, home to the planet’s tallest mountain, from January 1, has turned nasty.As state bodies at all levels, including the local government, are staking their unflinching claim to the skies over the Everest region, serious questions have been raised about Nepal’s high-end tourism prospects. Experts say such a jurisdiction issue may spill over to other national parks if this issue is not handled well. The federal government, however, has not taken the matter seriously.On December 12, the Sagarmatha National Park, which houses the world’s tallest peak, issued directives restricting commercial choppers from flying over it. On December 13, the civil aviation regulator responded that the park has no legal ground to enforce such a ban.After three days, on Monday, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, the local federal unit, issued a strongly worded statement against commercial chopper operations in the Everest region.“We request the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal and all travel agencies operating within this rural municipality to refrain from booking or selling any packages that include helicopter flights for the Khumbu region,” according to the statement. “If any individual or agency engages in such activities after this notice, and if it causes any obstacles or issues in this region, the rural municipality will not be held accountable. This press release has been issued to inform all concerned parties.”The municipality added: “Beyond Lukla, only rescue and sling flights that comply with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be allowed. All other commercial helicopter flights will be banned entirely from January 1.”As per the rural municipality directive, a recommendation must be obtained from the health institution at the flight site for emergency rescues. A health professional must be present on the flight. If further treatment outside the region is required, patients must undergo a test at Pasanglhamu Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla and get a mandatory recommendation from the hospital. “Henceforth, only rescue and sling flights in compliance with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be permitted beyond Lukla,” the municipal statement reads.The statement comes in response to one by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, which vowed not to follow the rules imposed by the national park and asked the helicopter companies to continue with their regular flights. The immediate concern raised by the park is severe noise pollution caused by frequent helicopter flights over the area. The noise disturbs animals, which rely on the park’s relatively undisturbed natural environment. Excess noise can interfere with their feeding, breeding, and other behaviours.The national park has tasked the Nepal Army and local youth groups with monitoring the ban, a development chopper operators see as a serious security concern.“The noise generated by choppers is alarming,” said Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality. “Every day, it feels like the loud noise will blow your ears out.”On November 13, the rural municipality held a discussion inviting ten lawmakers from the upper house of parliament in the Khumbu region. The programme had to be abandoned due to excessive noise of choppers. “Most complaints are from schools. The noise has affected the studies of children.”Every day, the rural municipality receives hordes of complaints from locals about noise pollution. “We do not oppose flights, but the helicopter companies are adamant about not obeying rules. They land anywhere they wish,” said Bhusal. According to the rural municipality, most helicopters are yet to pay the Rs200,000 annual “business tax” imposed by the local government. The park, which covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district, was established on July 19, 1976. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural surroundings and unique culture, it was put on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.The national park said noise pollution in the wildlife habitat has resulted in behavioural changes in animals.The sounds can cause wild animals to leave their habitats and run into the villages. The park authority said accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising. The shy natural goral is found foraging and sheltering on rocky faces of mountains.The animals jump off the cliffs in shock when choppers fly at low altitudes with big sounds. Their deaths are rising. The park authority said they had done justice to the wild animals by stopping commercial flights above the national park.Tourism ministry officials said they are aware of the issue. “We have been discussing the matter with the forest ministry,” said Ram Krishna Lamichhane, spokesperson for the tourism ministry. “We hope the issue will be sorted out soon.”The tourism fraternity warned that the Everest sightseeing ban could harm Nepal’s tourism, which is still struggling to recover to pre-Covid levels. The park is also a major tourist attraction, especially for trekking to the Everest base camp.The Everest sightseeing tour, which falls into an expensive, high-end tourism segment, is a lifelong dream of many people around the world. \nSamara endured six months of harassment from a relative of her late husband before a court interim order demanded her harasser leave her alone. In this period of inaction from the court, Samara (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) fell into depression and attempted suicide, feeling trapped and hopeless. “There is late justice, and these victims are still being victimised,” Samara’s legal counsel told the Post. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” Women in Nepal seeking justice for domestic violence or property partition wait years—often more than five and sometimes upwards of ten years—for the court to resolve their cases and fully implement the decision. The delays in case processing come at a cost to the women, who endure more harassment, financial strain, and loss of contact with their children as they wait for the justice system to take action. In the past year, the court has established a family bench in six of the 77 district courts in Nepal to hear women’s cases more quickly. The bench aims to give female plaintiffs faster decisions in cases related to family relations, alimony, domestic violence, and property division. The family bench, however, does not see a woman’s case when it also includes a legal matter outside of the purview of the bench, nor does the court see divorce cases as Nepali law mandates a one-year waiting period for divorce cases when one of the parties does not agree to the divorce. Since its filing, the main trial court has heard Samara’s case as it is tied to a property division case in which her late husband’s relative is the plaintiff. Samara’s interim order from the court has brought her some peace. Since the order two years ago, her harasser has stopped coming to her workplace demanding the property holdings of her late husband. “After she got the interim order, she believed in herself more,” Samara’s legal counsel said. “Before, she didn’t believe in court, she thought she would not get justice.” Samara’s legal counsel anticipates that the case will take at least another two and a half years at the district court, and may continue longer at the Supreme Court level if one of the parties chooses to appeal the decision. “She doesn’t feel protected,” the legal counsel said. Even when a woman’s case goes to the family bench, procedural hurdles can still delay the verdict, particularly when the case involves property division. Edha’s (who the Post is also identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) domestic violence and property division case is in its fourth year at the Kathmandu District Court. One of her hearings was with one of the three judges appointed to preside over the family bench. She had an arranged marriage more than 20 years ago, and soon after she gave birth to her first child. “After I got married, the abuse was non-stop,” she said. “It was quite brutal.”During her marriage, her husband, who continuously had relationships with other women, left her with serious injuries in bouts of violence, and pressured her to abort multiple pregnancies, though she did later have a second child as the pregnancy was too advanced to abort. Edha didn’t tell anyone about the abuse for most of her marriage. “If you’re going through something bad, if nobody comes to know, then it’s okay,” she said. “My fear was, if people find out, what will they think?”This fear of judgment stopped Edha from taking legal action for years. “In Nepal, if your husband hits you, that means it’s your fault,” she said. “With that kind of stigma, at times, I would just blame myself.” During the pandemic, Edha’s husband told her he wanted a divorce, and became more physically abusive. She decided to leave the house and move to a different home, though she felt hesitant about having to leave her children. “When he told me to get out of the house, and when he started hitting me, I thought I cannot survive in the house,” she said. “It was really difficult for me to leave. I feared I wouldn’t be able to take care of my children.”Edha hopes she will soon have her final hearing, which has been delayed because the court required further documentation. Edha fears seeing her abuser again at the hearing. “That fear is still within me,” she said. “I don’t want to look at that man.”After years of living alone, Edha feels most devastated by the loss of time with her children. She hopes her case will result in her being able to stay where she currently lives and have parental visitation rights. “They told me, within three months, this will be over,” she said between tears. “But it’s the fourth year running, and my kids are far away. I have missed the moments with them.” Edha feels stuck, with no other option than waiting for justice. “I don’t have any faith in the justice system of Nepal—no faith at all,” she said. According to domestic violence victims and their lawyers, when a male defendant has connections to judges or enough money to offer bribes, getting justice can be near impossible. Manika Khadka is a criminal lawyer working with the Women’s Foundation Nepal, and has seen dozens of women’s cases. “In some cases, he [the defendant] is so powerful and they use unnecessary power—that’s why we cannot get justice.”Neesa (also a pseudonym) filed a property division case against her husband nearly a decade ago and shortly after a domestic violence case. Male members of her family had for years violently abused her. Her cases have faced continuous delays, she claims, because of her husband’s bribes and connections to court officials. “You can go and register your case in the court, but then if corruption is involved… court procedures can be manipulated to cause delays,” she said. The Supreme Court has already issued a verdict in Neesa’s favor on the domestic violence case, ordering the defendant to pay both interim relief and a fine. The court, however, has failed to implement the decision.According to Neesa, because of bribes from her husband, officials in the implementation division of the district court have intentionally not enforced the Supreme Court’s verdict to make the defendant pay interim relief to the victim. Instead, the implementation division gave an order that would allow the defendant to avoid payment—a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s ruling. Neesa has no choice but to go back through the court system again, asking for the Supreme Court’s decision to be enforced. Her property case is still ongoing, and each step of the process takes months, she said. “There is a delay at every step of the process,” Neesa said. “The court officials don’t do their jobs efficiently.” Neesa feels frustrated with how long her cases have taken, and the amount of time, money and energy they have required from her. “It is a nightmare,” she said. “These delays and obstacles are attempts to make the plaintiff give up—women rarely have the resources to fight these cases for years and years.” “I can’t plan my life, I’m stuck,” she said. “It’s years of my life I won’t get back.” Samara, Edha, and Neesa each are equipped with legal counsel and have current cases pending, but, as Neesa reflected, innumerable women endure abuse in silence, particularly after they see other women endure long delays in the court cases. “I am educated and can stand up for myself and this is how I am treated, imagine the women who are uneducated,” Neesa said. “If [the court procedure] was simple and it was fair a lot more women would go through it and get justice,” she said.   \nSeven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said. \n\n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nExperts have recommended introducing a mandatory “cooling-off period” for retired civil servants before they can assume constitutional positions or other government roles. The suggestion was made during deliberations on the Federal Civil Service Bill, currently under review in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House of Representatives.Former chief secretary Bimal Koirala argued for the inclusion of a cooling-off period in the bill, stating that the lack of such provisions has turned constitutional commissions into ‘resting places’ for retired bureaucrats. “Why can’t we find qualified individuals from universities or other sectors for these positions?” he questioned during Tuesday’s meeting.Former chairperson of the Public Service Commission, Umesh Mainali, also seconded Koirala, suggesting a three-year cooling-off period. He highlighted the importance of ensuring that such appointments do not compromise the integrity of the civil service.Koirala further emphasised the need for parliamentarians to remain unaffected by interest groups and pressure tactics while drafting civil service legislation. “If we succumb to external influences while formulating civil service laws, how can we claim to be building a nation?” he said.The experts also criticised the proposed bill for being a mere replication of older laws, failing to reflect the spirit of federalism. Koirala pointed out that the centralised mindset is still dominant, with little effort to decentralise authority in line with the federal structure.Former Constituent Assembly member and administrator Janakraj Joshi suggested that civil service laws should prioritise public accountability and competence. He advocated for transparency in bureaucrats’ assets and proposed stricter measures against those holding green cards or permanent residency in a foreign country.Mainali criticised the draft bill for focusing more on employee benefits than on improving service delivery. “The bill should have emphasised public accountability and effective coordination between the administration and leadership,” he said, suggesting the inclusion of a dedicated chapter on responsibilities.Mainali termed the clause allowing the federal government to assign provincial secretaries a regressive provision and argued that such decisions undermine federal principles. He called for amendments to ensure provinces retain autonomy in appointing their secretaries.Experts also emphasised the need for predictable transfer and promotion policies, suggesting that the authority to manage such processes be delegated to the Public Service Commission. They further proposed maintaining the retirement age at 60 and setting entry age limits at 35 for men and 40 for women.  \nThe National Assembly chair, deputy chair, lawmakers and other officials from the federal parliament came together at an event in Kathmandu on Tuesday to discuss the current state of implementation of federalism in the country and ways to strengthen the federal system, which has been practiced in Nepal since 2017.National Assembly Chairman Narayan Prasad Dahal said that there were some mistakes in the course of practicing the newly adopted system. “Many have expected better delivery, economic prosperity and social justice, among other things, in the federal system,” Dahal said while addressing the interaction titled ‘Federalism, National Assembly and the tasks ahead’ jointly organised by the National Assembly and Federalism and Localisation Centre in Kathmandu on Tuesday. “Honestly speaking, there have been some shortcomings.”Bimala Ghimire, vice-chair of the Assembly, said that the upper house should play more role in strengthening the provincial and local levels.Former lawmaker Khim Lal Devkota, who is also chairman of the Centre, showcased a presentation on the issues raised in the seven provincial assemblies. Assembly Secretary Surendra Aryal explained the practices implemented by the Assembly and plans ahead.Parliamentary party leaders Narayankaji Shrestha of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Beduram Bhusal of CPN (Unified Socialist), and general secretary of the parliament secretariat Padam Prasad Pandey, among other officials, also spoke about strengthening the federal system.Lawmakers representing various provinces and dozens of other lawmakers and experts working in the field brainstormed about ways to strengthen the federal system, particularly the provinces. \nThe ruling coalition of the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML are finalizing mechanisms to amend the constitution, with the goal of addressing implementation difficulties and promoting political stability.\nDespite efforts by Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and former minister Pradeep Gyawali, Prime Minister KP Oli's anticipated India visit remains uncertain, as New Delhi has yet to extend an invitation, and his previous trip to China may have caused uneasiness.\nRabi Lamichhane, president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, suspended as lawmaker due to money laundering, cooperative fraud, and organized crime charges; party appoints acting president in his absence.\nFrom Saturday to Monday night, three individuals (Kul Prasad Acharya, Prabin Acharya, and Nayan Gurung) were murdered in Kathmandu Valley for various reasons, including depression and personal grievances.\nMilan Acharya turned himself into police on Tuesday, confessing to murdering his father and brother in their Balkot residence on Monday; the victims had injuries below their ears and police recovered a stone grinder and dumbbell at the scene.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City to begin on-the-spot random vehicle emission testing, imposing fines for exceeding permissible levels.\nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nThis year’s ‘Ncell Woman ICON ICT Award’ has been conferred to Bandana Sharma, who has been recognised for her significant contributions to the field of information technology. She recently received this prestigious award at the Grand Finale of the ICT Award 2024.Chief Minister of Karnali Province, Yamlal Kadel, and Ncell’s Corporate Communications and CSR Head, Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, jointly presented the ‘Ncell Woman ICON ICT Award 2024’ to Sharma. Currently serving as the Head of the Cards and Digital Banking Division at Nepal Bank, Sharma also received a cash prize of Rs300,000 along with the award.Every year, this award is presented to a woman who has made remarkable contributions to Nepal’s ICT sector. “We are delighted to continue this collaboration to encourage women in ICT and recognise their contributions,” said Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, Head of Corporate Communications and CSR at Ncell.Sharma began her career as an IT Support Officer at Nepal Bank in 2006. She has been instrumental in the bank’s digital transformation, contributing to core banking systems, network security, cybersecurity, and the development of customer-friendly digital services and infrastructure. \nFarmer Ratan Rawat of Chandannath Municipality, Jumla, diversified his farming from traditional paddy cultivation to cash crops like apples and vegetables.He initially used to cultivate paddy only. Rawat is now reducing the paddy cultivation area and increasing the area for apples and vegetables.“I used to transplant paddy on my 10 katthas of land. But for the last four years, I have been cultivating apples and vegetables,” he said. His paddy acreage has now been reduced to six katthas.Most of the farmers in the municipality, engaged in paddy farming, have now switched to cash crops.Khadak Budha, another farmer from the same village, has reduced the paddy field by half. He said he used to produce 30 sacks of paddy until a few years ago, but his output declined to 15 sacks.With the good income from apples and vegetables, Budha reduced the paddy acreage.“Apple is in demand,” said Rawat. Though he had no intention to cut on paddy cultivation, as apple farming started generating good income, he gradually switched to apple production.In the highlands of mid-western Nepal, commercial vegetable and apple farming thrived after paddy started to yield little income and there was a shortage of farmhands. The rise in disease also forced people to switch to cash crops from cereal production.“Vegetable farming generates better income than growing paddy. That’s why farmers shifted to vegetable farming,” said Rawat.Farmers have focused on the production of vegetable seeds as well.Compared to last year, paddy production has declined in Karnali this year. In the current fiscal year, 123,795 tonnes of paddy was produced on 39,763 hectares compared to 124,969 tonnes in the last fiscal year.In Karnali Province, paddy is mainly produced in Surkhet, Salyan, Dailekh and West Rukum. Jajarkot, Jumla, and Kalikot are also some areas where paddy is cultivated.The highest elevation at 3,050 metres is Chhumjul of Jumla, a record altitude where rice is cultivated in Nepal.According to the Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives, Surkhet produced 52,904 tonnes of paddy, more than the sum of Dailekh’s 25,120 tonnes and Salyan’s 23,630 tonnes. According to the statistics for the past five years, paddy production in Karnali has been continuously declining. In the fiscal year 2019-20, paddy output in Karnali was 151,805 tonnes, which dropped to 137,165 tonnes in 2020-21. The output dropped to 125, 143 tonnes in 2021-22 and rose slightly to 128,000 tonnes in 2022-23. Out of 299,339 hectares of arable land in Karnali, farming is done on 216,880 hectares. Paddy covers 45,468 hectares.According to the statistics, paddy in Surkhet covers 12,679 hectares, followed by 8,313 hectares in Dailekh and 7,078 hectares in Salyan. Similarly, in West Rukum, paddy is cultivated on 3,048 hectares, followed by Kalikot with 3,081 hectares and Jajarkot with 3,063 hectares.Purna Bahadur Thapa, the ministry's information officer, said that output and field of paddy both have declined sharply. “The paddy production area has shrunk, mainly in Surkhet, Dailekh, Jajarkot and Salyan.”Paddy production has dropped due to a lack of irrigation. The rainfall damages irrigation canals in the hilly district. “Lack of rainfall was also a problem. If the rainfall gets delayed, it creates difficulties sowing the seeds. As a result, paddy transplantation is not completed on time,” said Thapa. “The delay in paddy transplantation impacts production.”The provincial government data shows that out of the total irrigable land in Karnali, only 35.21 percent is covered by irrigation facilities. The round-the-year irrigation facility is provided only on 38,338 hectares, while 30,302 hectares are partially irrigated.Thapa said that the farmers also face the problem of insufficient seeds. As farmers have applied new hybrid seeds, new diseases have emerged. The increasing urban area also reduced production and farming land. \nLinking the excitement of cricket via Nepal Premiere League (NPL) to the classrooms, Ncell Foundation, as per its commitment, will be providing educational kits to 2,612 students from community schools across Nepal. This impactful initiative of the Ncell Foundation to support the students at community schools is tied to the 653 boundaries hit during the entire season of NPL that concluded on Saturday. “This is a testament to the Foundation's commitment to transforming the excitement of cricket into meaningful educational support for underserved communities wherein the Foundation has committed to allocating four educational kits for every 4s hit during the NPL,” Ncell said in a statement. Each kit to be provided to students will include essential items such as school bags, notebooks, pencils, sharpeners, erasers, and more. “This season’s NPL has been a milestone in nurturing Nepali cricketing talents. We are thrilled to collaborate with NPL, combining the passion for cricket with a cause that provides essential educational resources to needy students. We are committed to working with CAN, all regional teams and other stakeholders to ensure the successful attainment of 2,612 educational kits distribution,” said Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, Head of Corporate Communication and CSR at Ncell. \nNupu Sherpa of Tokpegola, situated around 4,100 meters above sea level in Mikwakhola Rural Municipality in Taplejung, sold 20 yaks in Tibet, China, back in 2019. He earned Rs110,000 per head, as there were no border restrictions on taking yaks to the Chinese market. Sherpa and five other herders in Thudam, Sankhuwasabha, a higher pass known as a centre for yak herding, used to sell yaks by crossing the Chinese border. During the pre-Covid period in 2019, the last time they traded yaks to Tibet, they brought Rs5 million each.But since then, they have not been able to export yaks to Tibet.“While trading in Tibet at that time, the 1 Chinese yuan was equivalent to Rs16,” said Sherpa. “I have heard that the rate has increased, but sadly, we cannot sell yaks anymore.”Sherpa currently owns 75 yaks, and all are mature enough to be sold. Normally, yaks have a life expectancy of 15-20 years, and after that, they turn thin and old. So, the commercial value of yak is at the age of 12.“The old yak does not fetch a good price, so selling them while they are still valuable is important,” said Sherpa. Now, to make ends meet, Sherpa has been making dog chews from yak milk. In the upper reaches, when the market in Tibet was open and vibrant, yaks were used as pack animals. “But now, rearing yaks has become a burden for many people,” said Sherpa.Nearly 180 households like Sherpa’s have the same problem—no market access.According to the Yak Farmers Federation, Taplejung, each family is rearing between five to 400 yaks.Sherpa, also president of the federation, said that their only alternative is to let yaks die. Yak farmers have requested Netra Prasad Sharma, chief district officer, to raise the issue with the officials on the other side of the border. Accordingly, on December 14, a meeting was held between the key officials of Taplejung and Dinggye County in southwest Tibet. “We have raised the issue, including to allow trade of agricultural products. It was the main agenda from our side at the meeting, but Tibet showed reluctance to resolve the issue faced by Nepalis living at the Nepal-China border point,” said Sharma.During the meeting, the Chinese representative said that Beijing would make the decision regarding livestock trade and that they would make requests to the higher authority.“We are hopeful the issue will be addressed,” said Sharma.The border people tried to export yak, milk, dog chew and ghee on different occasions but were returned, said Sharma.Kimathanka in Sankhuwasabha and 13 other trans-Himalayan trade points along the Nepal-China border were reopened in May after four years of closure.In May, then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha reached Tibet through the Kimathanka border point, and Vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Silang Nima jointly opened the traditional trading points amid a function in the Tibetan town of Chentang. They announced the reopening of 14 of the 21 trading points in various districts along Nepal’s mountain range.Chinese authorities closed the border passes in January 2020 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which severely disrupted the livelihoods of Nepalis living in remote mountain villages close to Tibet.“We have raised the issue at Nepal’s home ministry,” said Sharma.The locals who lost one of the crucial markets after Covid-19 were hopeful that the reopening of the border in May for people and trade movements would revive the yak trade.The residents in far-flung northern borders believe that the trade restrictions have also affected Tibet. Mingma Diki of Olangchung Gola said her family would buy yak calves from Tibet, rear them in Nepsl and sell them back to Tibet after they matured.“It’s strange that free trade with Tibet has stopped altogether.”Locals suspected that China might have stopped the yak trade due to lumpy skin disease that spread in Nepal in 2023. The first outbreak of lumpy skin disease in Nepal started in June 2020. By 2023, more than 48,000 cattle have died from the disease that has affected all of the country's 77 districts.More than 3,000 livestock were affected by lumpy skin in Taplejung, according to the Livestock Service Office.Tibet, however, has not officially made any statement about stopping yaks from coming from Nepal.“We submitted a special proposal on this issue, but Beijing declined it,” said Chheten Sherpa Lama, ward chairman of Phaktalung rural municipality, who was in the Nepali delegation with chief district officer Sharma, to Tibet as a translator.The population of yak has been increasing and causing additional burden to farmers, said Lama.“Feeding yaks is becoming increasingly difficult, and fodder shortages are adding to our hardship.”As per the District Livestock Office statistics, there are around 8,000 yaks in Taplejung. The federation said that even if a yak is priced at Rs50,000, Taplejung has yaks worth Rs400 million. Around 60 percent of yaks are at the age to be sold.Locals of the mountain region have been rearing yaks at 3,000 to 5,000 metres as their traditional occupation. They are reared particularly in the higher passes of Sirijunga, Phaktalung, Mikwakhola, Meringden and Phungling.According to the locals, yaks have also become prey to snow leopards, bears and wolves. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to launch a nationwide campaign offering the public free screenings for certain non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, and renal function, among others—in the ongoing fiscal year.The move aims to make people aware of the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, which account for around 80 percent of total deaths, officials say.“As per the instruction of the health minister [Pradip Poudel], we are planning to launch a nationwide campaign to screen for certain non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The campaign will be launched in the month of Falgun (February 13 to March 13).”Non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, liver problems, heart problems, and cervical cancer, among others have emerged as major killers in recent years, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. According to a 2019 study on the prevalence of non-communicable diseases by the Nepal Health Research Council, 71 percent of total deaths at present were due to non-communicable diseases, and an additional eight percent of deaths were linked to injuries. The study was primarily focused on behavioural risk factors like tobacco and alcohol consumption, as well as biological risk factors like high blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid levels, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. Officials hope that free screenings for non-communicable diseases will help raise awareness of risk factors and ultimately help lessen the disease burden.“This campaign aims to make people aware of the emerging risk factors caused by our changing lifestyle, food habits, and stress levels, among other things,” said Ghimire. Officials say that health workers will also organise outreach camps in remote areas where people must walk for hours for health screening.“The main purpose of the free screening campaign of non-communicable diseases is to make people aware of the problems,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Mental Health Section at the division. “The burden of non-communicable diseases has been raised alarmingly of late, and people are seeking care only when the problems worsen.”Early diagnosis and precautionary measures can help stop health problems from becoming serious, doctors say.Public health experts say that it is high time to focus on non-communicable diseases, as their burden has raised alarmingly. As most people do not undergo testing unless there is an emergency, doctors say it may be too late when the symptoms surface. They say that many lives could be saved if testing of non-communicable diseases is made free.Along with free testing, authorities must focus on behavioural changes—improvements in eating habits and physical exercises, among other things.“Countries like ours have been facing a double burden—an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases and the emergence of new vector-borne diseases and other communicable diseases,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Due to excessive use of processed foods, which contain preservatives, people suffer from multiple non-communicable diseases.”Several studies show alarming signs on a number of issues including growing consumption of alcohol, tobacco, salt and junk food, and insufficient intake of vegetables and fruits, which lead to cardiovascular diseases. Doctors say that along with ensuring free screening and treatment, authorities concerned should focus on raising awareness about lifestyle changes and associated risks. \nWith the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, the Ministry of Health and Population has stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Nepal reported the latest case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the disease. Nepal confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year, when a 60-year-old foreign national had tested positive.“We have increased health screenings of passengers entering the country from abroad, as per the instruction of the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Kanchhi Maya Twanju, a health worker deployed at the health desk set up at the Tribhuvan International Airport. “We have been instructed to send passengers having fever and those showing symptoms of mpox infection directly to hospitals.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries. Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases.Along with stepping up screening of the passengers entering the country via TIA, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have alerted dermatologists about the risk of an outbreak of mpox virus in the country and have requested them to refer suspected cases for testing,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We will take additional measures following consultations with stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation’s Nepal representatives.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks since it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases of infection can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions, saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.“We didn’t expect that the infected person would come from Saudi Arabia, as there is no outbreak currently,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “This incident shows that the deadly disease may come from any country, and we must remain vigilant and prepare agencies concerned accordingly.”Doctors say preventing an outbreak of the deadly viral disease is not the sole responsibility of a single health agency, and it is impossible to do so.“Every agency and person, including passengers, should shoulder the responsibility and take preventive measures,” Pun stated.Mpox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.Meanwhile, health officials informed that the condition of the infected man is normal and he will remain in hospital isolation for an additional two weeks.They said that they are also working to trace close contacts between the patients on the plane and the taxi driver who took him to the hospital. \nNepal reported another monkeypox or mpox case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the deadly disease. “Yes, samples of the suspect, who has been admitted to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, have returned positive results,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire. “We collected the samples on Thursday and got a positive report today [Friday].”Health authorities confirmed the first case of monkeypox infection in June last year.A 60-year-old foreign national had then tested positive for the infection.Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries . Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.According to health officials, the infected person, who is a migrant worker, was sent to the Dhapasi-based Grande International Hospital soon after arrival.Doctors at the hospital suspected monkeypox infection, based on the symptoms, and referred the patient to Sukraraj Hospital.“He had rashes in his private parts and blisters on hands and legs,” said a doctor at the hospital, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “The patient admitted to have had sexual contact in Saudi Arabia.”Officials at the EDCD said they will start contact tracing from Saturday.“We have to trace close contacts of the patient on the plane he travelled and the vehicle he used to go to hospitals,” said Ghimire. Public health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Monkeypox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came into widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases. \nNepal’s health authorities are mulling postponing the malaria elimination target to 2030, aligning with the World Health Organisation’s target, after efforts to contain the spread of the disease proved ineffective and it became impossible to declare the country ‘malaria-free’ by the 2026 deadline.What alarmed them most was the isolated indigenous cases that have emerged as a major challenge to eliminating the disease from the country even by 2030.“Isolated indigenous cases of malaria have become a major challenge in containing the spread of the deadly disease,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Single indigenous cases of infection have been reported from several places. We have been struggling to trace the source of infection.”Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes carry these deadly parasites, according to the World Health Organisation. Nepal had initially committed to achieving ‘malaria-free’ status by 2026. For this, the country needs to bring down indigenous cases or local transmission to zero, achieve zero deaths starting from 2023, and maintain zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.However, the country has failed to bring down indigenous cases to zero in both 2023 and 2024.Instead, cases of infections–both Indigenous and imported have risen alarmingly, which shattered any prospects of eliminating the disease within the deadline.Health officials say that only 16 cases of local transmission or indigenous cases were confirmed in 2023. But in 2024, more than 20 cases have been reported. Compared to 649 imported cases in 2023, the country witnessed nearly 1,000 such cases in 2024.Indigenous malaria cases are locally transmitted, meaning the infected person does not have a history of travel to a malaria-affected country. Officials say that the isolated indigenous cases of malaria infection are such cases that they do not have a history of travelling to the disease-endemic areas.“Neither the people of the community and family have been infected, nor the infected persons have a history of travelling to disease-hit areas,” said Dahal. “We have stepped up surveillance measures to trace the source of infection.”Officials attribute that the disease might remain asymptomatic for a long time in the infected person and emerge as single isolated cases or may have been contracted within the country in areas not considered endemic.Officials further added that open borders, budget cuts in the health sector, and mosquitoes moving to higher altitudes due to climate change have hindered Nepal’s malaria elimination goal.They say that of the total imported cases, over 80 percent came from India. Some cases were imported from African countries. Nepali security personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-hit African countries also often get tested positive for malaria.Officials say the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in Nepal unless India eradicates it first. They say that due to proximity, and an open and porous border between Nepal and India and unregulated travel of people of both countries, it is impossible to eliminate malaria in Nepal, until the disease gets eradicated in the southern neighbour.Several other factors, including cuts in the health budgets by government and aid agencies and shifts in vectors transmitting malaria to the hills and mountains due to global warming, also pose serious challenges to meeting the elimination target. Apart from this, most health facilities across the country lack entomologists necessary for conducting surveillance. Malaria-related deaths had stopped since 2016, but five years later, in 2021, the country recorded one death from the disease.Officials at the health ministry said that until recent years, Plasmodium Vivax, a protozoan parasite, had been responsible for most of the malaria cases in the country, which caused relatively less severe diseases. However, cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which most often cause severe and life-threatening malaria, have been rising. The parasite is common in many countries in Africa and the Sahara desert. \nThe holiday season has its rules, from its distinct colour palette to the cold weather. Listen closely, and you can hear the sound of bells jingling with their particular charm.If you are like me, the best thing to do during this time of year is to make yourself cosy in bed, wrap your blanket tightly, and snooze the alarm until the very last minute before being pulled by daily mundane routine. But once you start to see the familiar shades of red and white peeking through the decorations and hear the distinct tune of ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’ by Mariah Carey blasting through every department store you visit, with the smell of cocoa drifting through the air, you begin to grin from ear to ear, knowing that the holiday season is here.

The Department of Agriculture and Livestock, under KMC, found mold in packaged food items during an inspection prompted by customer complaints.Dr Awadhesh Jha, an inspection officer from the department, stated that the KMC call centre received complaints alleging the sale of “expired, rotten, and pest-infested food” at the store. Following the inspection, 44 packets of coconuts were found to contain mold, leading to their destruction on Friday and the subsequent fine imposed on the supermarket.In an official statement, KMC emphasised the importance of adhering to food safety regulations, saying, “The penalty amount must be deposited into the city’s revenue account. Moving forward, ensure that all items sold comply with Nepal’s laws and maintain high-quality standards fit for consumption.” \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally.

The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nSouth Africa will field debutant Corbin Bosch in their first test against Pakistan, starting on Boxing Day, as captain Temba Bavuma revealed the line-up on Tuesday.Bosch features in an all-seamer bowling line-up and will be playing on his home ground at Centurion, winning a test cap just days after making his one day international debut on Sunday, hitting 40 not out and taking one wicket as South Africa lost to Pakistan at the Wanderers in Johannesburg.The 30-year-old Bosch joins Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada and Dane Paterson in the home attack, getting an opportunity because of a long injury list that sees Ottneil Baartman, Nandre Burger, Gerald Coetzee, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje and Lizaad Williams all out because of injury or lack of fitness.\"It's one thing making your debut, but then to make it where you've made a name for yourself in the provincial setup is another thing,\" Bavuma said of Bosch at a press conference on Tuesday.\"I think Corbin adds an extra element to our bowling attack, he comes with the extra pace. Obviously, a big, strong guy as well, so one of the guys who can hit the deck hard.\"And he obviously offers a role with the bat as well. We saw in the ODI that he can hold his own with the bat. We're excited for him to see what he can do with the red ball and strengthen our bowling line-up,\" added the South Africa captain.Chasing WinThe all-pace attack means frontline spinner Keshav Maharaj sits out. \"I think it's no different to what we've generally gone with. We back our seamers here in Centurion and nothing has changed,\" Bavuma said.South Africa are chasing a win that would guarantee them a place in next June’s World Test Championship, as they sit top of the standings after winning their last five tests.\"We accept and acknowledge the fact that expectation has risen. There will be pressure that comes with that, but to be honest with you, we’re coming into the series to win the series 2-0, but we understand for us to do that, there's certain things that we need to do as a team.\"Keep things simple, keep doing the small things right and allowing the result to take care of itself,\" he added.South Africa team: Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Temba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Kyle Verreynne (wicketkeeper), Marco Jansen, Corbin Bosch, Kagiso Rabada, Dane Paterson. \nNepali all-rounder Kushal Malla is set to play in the International League T20 (ILT20) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after being signed by the Desert Vipers. The franchise brought Malla on board to replace injured Dutch all-rounder Bas de Leede.Desert Vipers’ Director of Cricket, Tom Moody, expressed confidence in Malla’s abilities, stating, “He is a young player but has already gained significant experience at the highest level.”Malla is currently Nepal’s fifth-highest run-scorer in T20 internationals, amassing 917 runs in 47 matches, including one century and four half-centuries. Notably, he scored an unbeaten 137 runs off 50 balls against Mongolia in the Asian Games, reaching his century in just 34 deliveries. Additionally, he has taken 43 wickets in both ODI and T20 international formats combined and has 768 runs in 39 ODIs.The Desert Vipers, runners-up in the inaugural ILT20 season, are set to face the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the opening match of the 2025 edition. The team boasts an impressive roster, including Alex Hales, Colin Munro, Rohan Mustafa, Wanindu Hasaranga, Sherfane Rutherford, Sheldon Cottrell, Tom Curran, Sam Billings, Luke Wood, Dinesh Chandimal, and Ruben Trumpelmann.The Desert Vipers is a professional Twenty20 franchise cricket team competing in the Emirati International League T20. \nNepal played out a 1-1 draw against Bhutan in a Women’s U-19 international friendly held on Sunday at the Dasharath Stadium.Sushila KC opened the scoring for Nepal with a brilliant strike from outside the penalty area in the 47th minute. However, this goal did not prove decisive, as Bhutan’s Phuntsho Choden equalised in the 80th minute.The match also featured a crucial defensive effort by Nepal’s defender Simran Rai, who made a spectacular goal-line clearance with a header in the 20th minute, denying Bhutan’s Choki Om from scoring. Apart from this, both teams failed to create significant attacking opportunities in the first half.In their previous Women’s U-16 friendly, Bhutan had defeated Nepal 5-1. \nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that Kurdish militants in Syria will either lay down their weapons or “be buried”, amid hostilities between Turkey-backed Syrian fighters and the militants since the fall of Bashar al-Assad this month.Following Assad’s departure, Ankara has repeatedly insisted that the Kurdish YPG militia must disband, asserting that the group has no place in Syria's future. The change in Syria's leadership has left the country's main Kurdish factions on the back foot.“The separatist murderers will either bid farewell to their weapons, or they will be buried in Syrian lands along with their weapons,” Erdogan told lawmakers from his ruling AK Party in parliament.“We will eradicate the terrorist organisation that is trying to weave a wall of blood between us and our Kurdish siblings,” he added.Turkey views the Kurdish YPG militia - the main component of the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militia, which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984.The PKK is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Ankara has repeatedly called on its NATO ally Washington and others to stop supporting the YPG.Earlier, Turkey’s defence ministry said the armed forces had killed 21 YPG-PKK militants in northern Syria and Iraq.In a Reuters interview last week, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi acknowledged the presence of PKK fighters in Syria for the first time, saying they had helped battle Islamic State and would return home if a total ceasefire was agreed with Turkey, a core demand from Ankara.He denied any organisational ties with the PKK.Erdogan also said Turkey would soon open its consulate in Aleppo, and added Ankara expected an increase in traffic at its borders in the summer of next year, as some of the millions of Syrian migrants it hosts begin returning. \nFalling debris from a Ukrainian drone that was shot down caused an explosion and a fatal fire in a shopping centre in the city of Vladikavkaz in Russia's North Ossetia region, the local governor said on Wednesday.Sergei Menyailo, the regional governor, wrote on his official Telegram account that air defence systems had shot down the drone at 0828 Moscow time (0528 GMT).One woman was reported to have been killed inside the shopping centre.Reuters could not verify the governor's assertion and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine.Russia’s Defence Ministry said 119 Ukrainian drones had been destroyed in the last 24 hours. \nThe actions of the Israeli military had a “circumstantial influence” on a decision by Hamas militants to kill six hostages in Gaza in August, according to a military investigation published on Tuesday.The recovery in September of the bodies of six Israeli hostages, including American-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin, triggered deep shock in Israel, prompting half a million people to stage street protests demanding the government enter a hostage deal with Hamas.The six, seized by Palestinian militants during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel, were shot dead 48-72 hours before being found by Israeli forces, according to health ministry estimates.The hostages were killed by their captors, the investigation found, and that the Israeli military’s activity “in the area, although gradual and cautious, had a circumstantial influence” on the militants’ decision to carry out the killings.The military had no prior intelligence about the presence of the six hostages in the area, the investigation found.“The investigation published tonight proves once again that the return of all hostages will only be possible through a deal,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Tuesday.Talks between Israel and Hamas to secure the release of the 100 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza are ongoing.An Israeli negotiation team plans to return to Israel from Qatar on Tuesday evening for “internal consultations” regarding a hostage deal after a significant week of talks about Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nOn December 19, 2024, the veteran communist leader and upper-house parliamentarian Bamdev Gautam caused quite a stir in the Dalit community by suggesting that the word ‘Dalit’ must be removed from official documents, including the constitution and the law. He made a fallacious argument that removing the word Dalit from all written documents would somehow emancipate that community and guarantee their rights.Speaking to the National Assembly’s Development, Economic Affairs and Good Governance, Gautam said, “Let’s remove the term Dalit from our dictionary… On the one hand, we decry discrimination against Dalits and the infringement of their rights; but on the other, our language, acts, constitution, law as well as document written by the scholars all refer to them as Dalits.” No doubt, Dalit has become a controversial term over the years, even within the Dalit community. Social media is full of comments from ordinary people, most of whom are upper castes, where the word is presented as a kind of license to dominate and discriminate against the “untouchables”. And, strangely, some Dalits themselves tend to agree! Especially the younger generation of Dalits, particularly those from the towns and with some opportunities and privileges, harbour a degree of disgust with the word. They think Dalit identity, Dalit quotas and Dalit literature have further exposed them to discrimination. There’s some truth in that, of course, but it’s a mistaken understanding.But this is the first time a senior communist politician—a former deputy prime minister and home minister—has expressed his anger at the Dalit word. How do we understand this attitude of a senior politician towards us? What does he want by attacking Dalit identity, one wonders: True liberation of Dalits or the end of their limited access to power and privilege?A nonsensical argumentGautam’s assertion on removing the word Dalit from legal and official documents and literature apparently for their own sake doesn’t make any sense. There’s no evidence to suggest that simply getting rid of a word automatically liberates the community from traditional oppression. There’s the glaring case of India. The Dalits of this country started using the term Dalit as their self-identification centuries ago. However, the Constitution of independent India, passed by the Constituent Assembly on November 29, 1949, doesn’t refer to any caste or community as a “Dalit”. The untouchables have been constitutionally and legally identified as the “scheduled caste” instead.A question to respected Gautam is: Has the avoidance of the term Dalit from the official lingo in India really contributed to the emancipation of Dalits? Has this policy really stopped the practice of untouchability in society? The answer is, squarely, no!In contrast, the usage of the term Dalit in Nepal is quite recent. The political movements of the “untouchables”, often supported by the Nepali Congress Party and the communist parties, borrowed it from India and started using it in their movements only seven decades ago. But we’ve been subjugated, exploited, separated and humiliated as “untouchables”, following Hindu laws, from centuries ago, well before the unification of Nepal by Prithvi Narayan Shah in the mid-18th century. It’s important to keep in mind, therefore, that the significant section of the Nepali population currently recognised as Dalits have been suppressed and tormented, including through state laws and policies (such as the Muluki Ain of 1854), since long before the use of the term came into use. Is it fair then to lay the entire blame of Dalit suffering on what I would consider an innocent word?Change culture, not literature Nobody would suggest that one word or one form of identity should be established forever. Healthy debates and discussions on any identification must be welcomed and encouraged. It’s a good idea to change communal identity befitting the changing times. But this should happen amongst the concerned groups themselves; upper-caste leaders like Gautam must not intervene.But many of us hold that this is not the time to argue against using the term Dalit. For one thing, unlike humiliating terms like untouchable and water-unusable and low caste and small caste, Dalit identity wasn’t forced upon us by the state or the religion. The state started using this term, instead of the other highly stigmatised terms mentioned above, according to our own needs and demands. Moreover, it’s crazy to think that simply removing the word would remove the stigma of caste and minimise caste hatred against us. It’s not that simple, is it? In this futile exercise, various Dalit groups have adopted new surnames including some resembling the prestigious upper-caste surnames. The Kami and Damai each has more than two hundred family names! A fake family name would provide a degree of cover against caste prejudice in unfamiliar social settings—but that doesn’t, and hasn’t, in any way, liberated anybody from the traditional forms of exclusion and humiliation. We recently met with former prime minister and Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who agreed with our assertion that political changes alone haven’t changed the situation of Dalits on the ground. What is truly required is a separate “cultural revolution” against the caste system. I’ve heard some other senior politicians from across the party spectrum express a similar sentiment. Neither Dahal nor we meant here the cultural revolution conducted by Chairman Mao in China in 1967-76. I’ve long advocated the need for religious and cultural reforms to tackle the entrenched problem of caste discrimination in this country. The key to our success. People often frown at our assertion to conduct religious reform, maintaining that it’s impossible to amend Brahmanism. True, religious texts like Manusmriti can’t be reviewed as easily as a constitution or law. But that doesn’t mean religious traditions and beliefs can’t be corrected according to changing times. Our society has undergone many religious and cultural reforms in recent years. Upper castes no longer require ritual purification after returning from sea voyages. Intercaste marriage is quite common and acceptable, among non-Dalits in particular. Today’s Bahuns are free to drink alcohol, eat with other castes, play drums, run iron workshops and tailoring shops. Society has been far more rigid when it comes to reforming the religion and culture to guarantee the constitutional and legal rights of Dalits. That’s the last push we must all attempt. Despite the strong inertia, the state can reform religious and cultural beliefs and practices, with the aid of modern laws. Dalit freedom fighters must pressure the ruling class to work in that direction. We all want to break the chain of Dalitness. We have no pride in being born a Dalit. It’s an identity that should be dumped in the dustbin of history. But we will only become free from Dalit identity when the rituals and customs get rid of the practice of untouchability.  \nThroughout Nepal’s legal history, juvenile justice has remained a neglected issue. Only after Nepal ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) on September 14, 1990, did the concept of justice for children begin. The commitment also led Nepal to introduce the Children’s Act, 2048 (1992). The Act served as the first-ever legislation related to children and their rights. While it was a landmark step for the security of children, it still fell short of our expectations.The act was weak and outdated with vague provisions and inadequate protections for children who fell into conflict with the law. So, the call for a more comprehensive legal framework grew louder. This demand cultivated an environment for formulating the Act Relating to Children 2018, which strengthened Nepal’s juvenile justice framework. However, despite the advancements, challenges remain as the law fails to bridge the gap between law and practice.Under the fourth subsection of Provision 43 in the 2018 Act, it is stipulated that “when a juvenile offender reaches the age of eighteen while still serving their sentence, they aren’t to be transferred to an adult prison, but rather to a special facility”. A special facility for those transitioning from juvenile centres to adult prisons was attempted, but it didn’t materialise, likely due to logistical challenges. As a result, juveniles as young as 12 years are housed alongside individuals nearing 30. This practice alone has been overcrowding juvenile facilities. When supported by a weakly enforced law, this system blatantly contradicts the CRC, which prohibits the housing of juvenile convicts with adult convicts.Earlier this year, in conversation with the director of the Underprivileged Children’s Educational Programme (UCEP)—an organisation advocating for child rights—I discovered that all eight of Nepal’s juvenile detention centres have a combined capacity of just 390. But more than 1,300 delinquents are kept in these facilities, which creates severe overcrowding.The effects of overcrowded facilities extend beyond logistical challenges. They also leave a harmful mark on the psychological, intellectual and moral development of the juveniles. Undoubtedly, an individual’s growth is heavily influenced by their surroundings. The young mind is malleable, and when put in an environment far from conducive, the chances of them adopting harmful behaviours are sky-high. The recent incidents in Nepal’s juvenile centres highlight a serious dysfunction. For instance, this July, the Jayandu Juvenile Correction Centre in Banke saw a violent delinquent-led outburst, marking a third such incident of its kind in just 12 months. These clashes, which resulted in deaths and numerous injuries, accentuate the need to address the systemic flaws in our judicial system. However, when discussing the issue, it is equally crucial to note that the roots of these problems don’t just lie in our flawed legal system. They are deeply connected with the socioeconomic realities of incarcerated children.From my interview with the UCEP, I found that 95 percent of these young delinquents come from struggling, impoverished families. These are children who have never known a life beyond their huts and farming; children who aren’t familiar with financial peace; children who battle to survive each day; children who commit crimes, unaware that it makes them criminals. This is a situation born out of legal illiteracy. The level of legal literacy among the youth in urban centres like Kathmandu itself is weak and the concept is practically foreign in the villages. As a student, I believe that a good part of this shortcoming is a direct reflection of the weakness of our education system. While the government-issued school-level curriculum includes topics related to the constitution and the legal system, the content merely scratches the surface. The coursebooks enlist laws, yet they fail to inform about the consequences of breaking them. Our curriculum omits crucial details about the legal process, like the trial system, juvenile detention centres and what follows the commission of a crime. This superficial approach leaves students with minimal knowledge on our rights and responsibilities, making us vulnerable to unintentional infractions.However, it would be unfair to place the entire blame on the curriculum alone, as society, too, plays a big role in this issue. With limited public discourse on legal rights, provisions and consequences, our society is failing the youth. I’ve witnessed that society often consumes itself with discussions on matters unrelated to our immediate concerns. They fail to devote time and attention to educating the young about the legal system governing them. If we allocate even a fraction of our focus to legal education, especially for the youths, the next generation will be safe from falling into conflict with the law.Ultimately, this failure to provide comprehensive legal education, by both the curriculum and civil society, leaves us with only a shallow understanding of our rights and responsibilities as citizens. This lack of awareness makes us highly vulnerable within the justice system, where ignorance invites consequences. So I ask, why should children bear the title of convict if they are unaware that their normality is a federal offence? Why should they pay the price for the weakness of the government-issued curriculum? It’s about time we shifted our approach. We must establish a society where juveniles can find security in lawmakers and law enforcement officers. Educators must never forget that legal advancements are only effective with proper implementation.  \nA few days ago, I attended a programme related to the Institute of Federalism at Madhesh University. During the event held in Rautahat, some participants questioned me about my stance on universities. They noted that when I was a member of Parliament, I opposed the proliferation of universities in Nepal, yet now I support Madhesh University. Their concern was valid, and I welcomed the opportunity to clarify my position.When I served in the National Assembly, I was the only member who voted against establishing new federal universities. My argument has been based on the constitutional framework. The Constitution of Nepal grants provinces the authority to set up and manage provincial universities. With over a dozen universities already under federal jurisdiction, adding federal universities appears unnecessary. Instead, provinces should lead the creation of universities tailored to their specific needs and provide sufficient justification.However, I have consistently emphasised that the federal government’s role should focus on forming a comprehensive higher education policy and an umbrella act for universities. This would create a clear framework for both federal and provincial governments to work together in expanding higher education. Without such a policy and legislative framework, the uncoordinated establishment of universities could strain resources, duplicate efforts and compromise quality. The federal government allocates funds to universities through the University Grants Commission (UGC), and at the provincial level, funding comes via fiscal transfers. However, if the trend of opening new universities continues, having both federal and provincial institutions compete for UGC grants and redirecting funds away from provinces and local governments to the UGC will undermine the purpose of establishing new universities at either the federal or provincial level.Addressing the broader issue of the Ministry of Education’s budget allocation is crucial to understanding where the federal education budget is spent, how much is retained at the federal level, and how much is allocated to provinces and local governments. This in turn helps us examine the UGC’s role in managing these funds at the federal level. Understanding these dynamics is essential for creating a more effective and equitable education system in Nepal.In the fiscal year 2024-25, the Ministry of Education received Rs203.66 billion, with 28.33 percent (Rs57.70 billion) directed to the federal level, 2.26 percent (Rs4.61 billion) to the provinces and 69.41 percent (Rs141.36 billion) to local levels. Analysing the federal allocation of Rs57.70 billion reveals distinct trends. The UGC leads federal education spending, with its share rising from 23.5 percent in FY 2019-20 to 33.21 percent in FY 2024-25. However, most of this funding is used for operational activities rather than research and innovation. School teacher pensions also comprise a significant portion, accounting for 32.93 percent of the federal budget, limiting investments in infrastructure and innovative programmes.The Central Implementation Unit (CIU), with Rs460 million (7.97 percent), manages major education projects, including externally funded initiatives, but there are concerns about its centralised resource management. The Medical Education Commission (MEC) has seen a notable rise in its allocation, from 1.38 percent to 8.96 percent, reflecting a focus on healthcare workforce development. However, the issue of scholarship recipients often leaving Nepal for better opportunities abroad remains challenging.There has been a slight decrease in budget for programmes such as the Higher Education Promotion Programme (HEPP) and the School Sector Development Programme (SSDP), with overlapping roles between HEPP and UGC causing inefficiencies. The SSDP, later replaced by the School Education Sector Plan (SESP), shifted more funding to provincial and local levels, limiting federal involvement to training, administration and curriculum development. Meanwhile, allocations for the President’s Education Reform Programme (1.52 percent) and the Center for Education and Human Resource Development (CEHRD) (1.47 percent) have been criticised for impractical implementation and centralised budgeting.The President’s Education Reform Programme has bypassed the decision-making authority of local governments. The programme often selects school projects at the federal level, with funds allocated to constituencies linked to influential figures. For instance, in FY 2023-24, Education Minister Devendra Poudel directed a large share of the budget to his home district, Baglung, benefiting 143 schools (Kantipur, March 28, 2024). Similarly, in FY 2024-25, the programme prioritised earthquake-affected schools in Jajarkot and Bajhang. Such practices have raised concerns about equitable resource distribution and the programme’s alignment with decentralised governance principles.The Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT), which manages technical and vocational education, received Rs159.59 million (2.77 percent), indicating slow progress in expanding vocational education. Despite increased funding for coordination units like the Education Development and Coordination Unit, the federal budget prioritises pensions, operational activities and centralised programmes over transformative reforms or addressing systemic gaps. These trends suggest the need to reevaluate federal spending to balance decentralisation goals with efficient resource use and equitable education improvements across all levels.At the provincial level, the FY 2024-25 education budget is Rs4.61 billion (2.26 percent of the total Ministry of Education budget), allocated through a conditional grant from the federal government. The CTEVT dominates provincial allocations, receiving 78.4 percent of the total, highlighting a focus on vocational education and technical training, crucial for developing a skilled workforce. Despite its devolved functions, the National Education Board (NEB) receives only 7.3 percent of the provincial budget, suggesting that its activities remain centrally managed, limiting provincial autonomy.In FY 2024-25, 69.41 percent of Nepal’s Ministry of Education budget—Rs141.36 billion—was allocated to local governments as conditional grants. A large portion of the local education budget, 78.21 percent (Rs. 110.60 billion), is directed toward teacher salaries. This allocation supports community schools comprising 85.1 percent of Nepal’s 27,990 schools. Most of this salary budget (68 percent) is spent on basic-level teachers for Grades 1-5, where 67.3 percent of students are enrolled. While prioritising teacher salaries ensures operational continuity, it restricts the local government’s ability to fund other pressing needs. Globally, decentralisation models advocate for more diversified budget allocation to address broader educational challenges effectively.Programmes like day meal initiatives, which help retain students and address malnutrition, receive only 5.99 percent of the budget (Rs8.47 billion). Free textbook grants, including materials in local languages, account for just 2.7 percent (Rs3.81 billion). These essential programmes suffer from limited funding, particularly in underserved communities.Similarly, funding for infrastructure and educational quality is severely inadequate. Only 1.34 percent of the budget goes to school operation and management grants; performance-based incentives for improving educational outcomes account for just 2.17 percent. Less than 2 percent is allocated to school construction, hindering efforts to modernise and enhance learning environments, particularly in rural areas.The rigid structure of budget allocations under the SESP, with over 91 percent of the budget locked into predefined programmes like salaries, meals, and textbooks, limits local governments’ autonomy to create initiatives tailored to their communities’ specific educational needs. In contrast, international best practices grant local authorities greater decision-making power, enabling them to effectively address diverse and evolving educational demands.Minimal investment in alternative education, digital learning and innovative programmes—each receiving less than 2 percent—also emphasises the need to align local budgets with modern educational goals, such as technology integration, bridging access disparities and fostering innovation. \nNepal’s dairy sector has for long been under financial strain. The cost of milk and milk products has spiked so much that many households have cut down on (or entirely stopped) their consumption. The price of processed milk, which was Rs76 a litre in January 2022, has climbed up to Rs120 a litre. Dairy products from Uttar Pradesh of India that are comparatively cheaper (INR62 or Rs100 a litre) are also smuggled into the country. As a result of reduced demand and steady imports of cheap products, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation now has a stockpile of 600 tonnes of butter and 500 tonnes of powdered milk, and the farmers are yet to get Rs580 million the cash-strapped DDC owes them. Farmers, dismayed by the delays in payment, have often had to take to the streets.In an effort to settle the problem, the DDC has started exploring domestic private as well as international markets. To start with, it has agreed to supply 1,000 kg of raw cheese or whey (used to make chhurpi which is also called hard cheese) to a private company daily, starting December 30. The DDC will need 10,000 litres of milk a day to do so. The company, Himalayan Dog Chew, owned by the Manaram Group, exports chhurpi to the United States. Known as dog chew in the West, chhurpi is quite popular and in high demand among the owners of pooches in the US and Canada. But exporters in Nepal have struggled to meet the demand. So the deal between the private company and the DDC couldn’t have come at a better time. The dairy corporation has, for the first time, collaborated with the private sector to sell its products. But there’s still a lot of work to be done. As reported in Kantipur, the Post’s sister publication, eastern Nepal has a huge potential to export hard cheese, and some small dairy firms and farmers, with their own efforts, are selling these products in India without branding them. If Nepal could brand them and strike multiple such partnerships with more private companies in the countries in its immediate neighborhood, it could be to the benefit of both the DDC and the dairy farmers. Exporting milk products with the help of the private sector could bring relief to the farmers and the broader dairy industry. However, the success of this initiative is contingent on strong coordination between private companies and farmers. To facilitate this, the dairy corporation should establish a clear mechanism to get the milk from the farmers, who are at the start of the supply chain, to the exporters, who are at the end. There should also be a lot more coordination. For instance, while the demand for chhurpi is healthy, the butter that emerges during dog chew production doesn’t get the market. As the DDC is also planning to export butter to Tibet and to the larger Chinese markets, establishing a seamless channel of trade and communication between the farmers, the DDC and the private buyers would be vital. If China agrees to Nepal’s export proposal, experts say that the DDC’s products will not stockpile. With a little more thought put into the process, it could be a win-win prospect for all three sides.   \nThe Maoist party, which joined mainstream politics by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006, has always had a peculiar relation with semantics. In the insurgency days, the top Maoist leaders were not known by their real names but their noms de guerre. Partly, this was done to hide their identity, and partly, it was their way of overcoming individualism and pursuing a larger cause. Thus Pushpa Kamal Dahal became ‘Prachanda’, Baburam Bhattarai ‘Laldhoj’, Barsha Man Pun ‘Ananta’ and so on. The party has itself undergone various name changes to arrive at its current avatar of CPN (Maoist Centre). There are often rumours of the party leaders mulling removing the ‘Maoist’ tag. Despite this seeming flexibility, it must hurt all those involved in the decade-long war when the country’s top court repeatedly rejects their attempts to recognise the janayuddha (‘people’s war’). Most recently, the apex court ruled that it is unconstitutional to use the term in official documents. A year ago, it had rejected the-then Maoist-led government’s efforts to declare a public holiday on ‘People’s War Day’. With their strongest claim to political space—a self-sacrificing war waged for the benefit of the downtrodden and the marginalised communities—legally rejected, the use of violence that took nearly 17,000 lives, and left countless more disabled and ‘disappeared’, will be questioned even more in the days ahead. The Maoists and a section of the intelligentsia continue to talk up the war’s achievements: There would apparently have been no republican federal state without the war. Or a system of reservations for the marginalised communities. (Even this newspaper acknowledges the Maoist role in these developments.) Yet it is as important to factor in the party’s evolution in the post-war years. The causes that the party once held dear—particularly issues of the poorest and most marginalized sections of the society—have repeatedly been sacrificed at the altars of Dahal’s naked quest for power. These days, there is little to choose between the Maoist Centre and the old ‘bourgeois’ parties in the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML that the former rebels once held responsible for all social ills. Times are also changing. Those born in the past three decades have little or no memory of the war. Instead, they have seen how its supposed achievements have been endlessly abused by leaders from across the political spectrum. For these younger folks, the idea of getting political legitimacy through a war waged in the name of Mao—a bloodthirsty dictator from another time and place—just does not sound right. Of late, the CPN (Maoist Centre) party has been making much of its ‘stellar’ showing in the recent bypolls. This, say party leaders, is an indication that their popularity is again on the up. That is unlikely. These small pockets of electoral success aside, indications are that people are highly dissatisfied by the functioning of the Maoist party as well as its chair Dahal. The loss in support among its once core constituencies is particularly alarming. Unless the Maoist leadership is ready to internalise and acknowledge how it has let these constituencies down and to commit to rectifying its mistakes, an electoral comeback looks tough. Unfortunately, for Dahal and his followers, there is no going back to the old-school janayuddha either.   \nLong gone are the smog-free winter days. As soon as the temperatures dip, the bowl-shaped topography of Kathmandu Valley traps pollutants in the atmosphere, making its air one of the most toxic in the world. The problem is not limited to the federal capital and its periphery though, as other cities and districts in the country also fare poorly in this regard. All of Nepal’s 30.7 million people now live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline of 5 micrograms per cubic metre. This has cut the life expectancy of Nepalis by nearly five years, as reported by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) issued by the Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago.Though illegal, the practices of stubble burning in the fields, and open-waste or plastic burning in the backyards of houses, street corners and even public spaces, are widespread. Moreover, construction works on roads and sidewalks that linger for months or years result in much dust and dirt, while contractors often show little urgency to meet the deadlines. Little do people consider that their small part, when extrapolated across a large population, is making the air unbreathable and destroying their health. The systemic neglect of authorities is also exacerbating the air pollution crisis.Breathing in unhealthy air has multiple health consequences. Health workers warn that exposure to foul air can in the short term lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke and heart problems. Over time, it can cause severe conditions such as ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases and heart complications. Since the start of the dry season this year, hospitals in the Valley have witnessed a steady rise in the number of patients—mostly children and elderly—with respiratory illnesses. A recent Nepal Health Research Council study shows that children in Kathmandu Valley are particularly vulnerable to air pollution due to their exposure while commuting to and from schools. In response, the Ministry of Forests and Environment has recently asked people to focus on maintaining their vehicles, using clean energy, controlling smoke and dust coming from roads and construction work, and refraining from burning plastic. But such directives are more often ignored than they are heeded, by both the public and authorities. While sprinkling water on roads and sweeping the dust can keep our surroundings clean, these activities are no solutions to the problem of air pollution. Worryingly, promoting clean energy, including in our kitchens, doesn’t seem to be a priority of our political leaders and authorities. Experts also often point to lack of coordination between different agencies to tackle air pollution. We thus need a complete overhaul of the way we manage air pollution. Lasting solutions will emerge only through greater collaboration, for instance, between the local units, and the ministries of transport, health and population and urban development. Local authorities can control open burning through stringent rules and monitoring; the transport ministry too could get serious about phasing out old vehicles that emit pollutants. While pollution from cities in northern India has also been identified as a contributor to poor air quality in Nepali border towns and the capital city of Kathmandu, perhaps the locally generated pollutants are an even bigger threat. If we fail to do our bit to clean our own air, we also lose the moral ground to point fingers at other countries. With the right policies, programmes and mindset, the air we breathe would be a lot healthier.  \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) was formed in August 2021 by a group of dissident CPN-UML leaders including two former party chiefs and ex-prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal. The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders. We are thinking of concluding this process [of welcoming him] soon.What about Bhim Rawal joining the party?Unhappy with the party leadership, he has been inactive in the UML but he has not made up his mind to join our party.Is finalising Gautam’s hierarchy and role in the party taking time?There won’t be an issue in the case of Bamdev ji. But overall, the number of leaders in our party is big. In the Chinese Communist Party, there are only seven members in the Politburo Standing Committee and 17 members in Other Politburo Members. But there are 24 members in our party’s central secretariat, 41 in the standing committee and 108 members in the politburo. Those who get a candidacy in the election celebrate but those who don’t get a ticket become inactive. Some others fight for ministerial posts. Yet others complain about not getting a ‘lucrative’ ministry. We have to manage them all.What about reunifying the party with the UML or the Maoist Centre? Many say leaders are more comfortable with the Maoist Centre but party cadres are for rejoining the UML.Most of our cadres are from the UML background. That might have played a role. But at present there is no possibility of our reunification with the UML. Also, the situation isn’t right to forge unity with the Maoist Centre.It is said that there is pressure from party members for reunification with the UML?That’s not true. There is a negative view about us in the UML and therefore our party rank and file wouldn’t be ready to surrender. Some might be lobbying for entry into the UML for personal benefits. Even if some join the UML, it won’t be easy for them there.But some noted leaders such as Ram Kumari Jhakri who had strongly supported you in the course of building this party have said that the Unified Socialist can’t run like this and that it is better to merge with the UML?I also enquired about her remarks but she said her intent had been misunderstood. But I repeat that there is no possibility of unity with the UML. We studied the possibility of unity with the Maoist Centre but concluded that we can’t accept Maoism and we also found their election symbol inappropriate. So the process has stopped. For now, we will concentrate on strengthening our own party.How is the Unified Socialist different from the UML?Our’s is a policy-driven party and not leader-centric. Committee system prevails in our organisation, not the leader’s orders. We discard rightist approaches and follow revolutionary ideas. We don’t see these qualities in the UML. Only our party has a policy of ‘Socialism with Nepali Characteristics’. We prioritise our agenda based on justice, fair distribution, production and good governance. There was a period when socialism stressed only on equality and therefore some termed it a distribution of poverty but we believe socialism as a principle of prosperity. Capitalism focuses only on profits even at the cost of people’s lives and wars but socialism values people’s lives and livelihoods. So, we are clearly against capitalism and in favour of socialism. But there are different forms of capitalism. We are for promoting national capitalism and eliminating comprador capitalists. We need to invite and welcome foreign investment to increase production in the country.Your party held its general convention in July first week and it took months to elect other office bearers and assign roles and responsibilities. Why?It shouldn’t have happened. Some wrong elements entered our party. Some showed immaturity by raising the issue of ‘new generation’. That spoiled the situation. Building a party is not easy. It calls for many things including ideological clarity, capacity to lead the organisation efficiently and an accepted personality. We have to learn from this episode and remove the mistrust that cropped up in this course. \nIt has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that western disturbances and a low-pressure system are currently influencing Nepal.
